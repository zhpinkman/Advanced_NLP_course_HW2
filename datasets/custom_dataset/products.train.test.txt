I was skeptical when I first heard they were making a "Freddy vs Jason" movie. The chances of getting it totally wrong seemed quite high. After viewing the film, however, I was pleasantly surprised. The plot makes a twisted kind of sense, the performances by Robert Englund and Ken Kirzinger are inspired and enthusiastic, and the special effects are top-notch. ---  --- As a Nightmare on Elm Street fan, I was pleased that the movie seemed to fit the tone of previous Nightmare movies. I was, however, intrigued by the Jason backstory and scenes. Since then I have become a fan of the Friday the 13th pictures also. ---  --- If you like either franchise, you will most likely enjoy Freddy vs Jason. Even though the final battle might not end the way you would prefer
Whenever my eczema flared up, my friends would tell me I'm too stressed out.  I didn't feel that way, not much more stressed out than usual, so the timing of the flare ups and the stress level at that time was sometimes confusing.  --- After reading this book, however, I recognized it's much more than just the simple stress - more deeply rooted issues I've apparently held for a long time.  I had vaguely suspected this may be the case, but didn't know how/where to start.  This book gave me the guidance to do that on my own. ---  --- I agree with 3 other reviewers completely. I no longer feel helpless and scared when I can feel my skin starting to flare up. I am not yet free from eczema, but knowing what may be the underlying cause of it, and how to calm it down, I have much stronger sense of being in control of my skin, body and my life
When I ordered this skort the description didn't say that it was a childs size.  So I complained to the site that I bought it from.  I asked that my shipping also be returned because they didn't specify that this was a childs size.  I wasted my money on shipping for an item I wouldn't have ordered if I had known it wasn't an adult sized item.  They didn't return my shipping
This has always been a favorite film of mine.  The story is old-fashioned yet fun and the cast is divine.  Despite having the VHS, I wanted more and ordered the DVD. ---  --- Beware!  This DVD claims on its packaging to have Closed Captioning, but it does NOT!!  No subtitles in any language,  no line 21 captioning. ---  --- Nor does it have anything else.  "Interactive Menus" means scene selections.  This plain vanilla release doesn't even have a trailer. This film and cast deserves better and I see no reason Lion's Gate reissued this DVD with nothing added.   ---  --- Since I bought it online, I can't return it and neither Lion's Gate nor Artisan will take it back despite the error in labeling and false advertising which is not the fault of the people I bought it from
I wouldn't eat out with my 14 month old and 4 year old without taking along a Table Topper for each of them.  The self-sticking tabs on the top and bottom hold them securely in place, creating a clean surface for toddlers and pre-schoolers to munch on finger foods and place their utensils without worry of restaurant-table germs.   I wish I had thought of these!!  They're a great invention for families on the go
Very dissatisfied with the quality like several other reviewers.  Relegated to cleaning after just one use
I've been a user of quicken for at least ten years. I've liked the product historically, but this version is garbage. Like other users, I too have fallen victim to the 'out of memory' error. Guess what? There's nothing I can do. I can't go back to a previous version of Quicken, because my data file isn't compatable.  ---  --- Honestly, I blame myself for not reading the feedback others had left first. I was brand loyal to Intuit, but now I'm paying the price. The software is garbage, stay away.
I found a supposedly "New remastered edition" of Sade's "Diamond Life" on sale for less than 10 bucks. OOPS! Great mistake! When I tried to return it, the CD store was already out of business, and the copy is one issued in the Netherlands which is marked INTO THE BOOKLET as "2000 Digital Remastered Version". The whole album HAS BEEN RE-RECORDED with new arrangements! The digital sound is quite good, but the new arrangements made for 'Smooth Operator' REALLY SUCKS!!
"Col Mike Martin" raised in Iraq, speaks fluent arabic......... ---  --- The Taliban are Pashtoon, they are not arabs, they don't speak arabic, they don't even like arabs very much. They are a totaly closed tribal society. I spent a year living and working with the Pashtoon in 2005 in Helmand Province. There are no members of the Taliban who are not Pashtoon. The other ethnic groups in Afghanistan, the Tajik and the Hazara, are opposed to the Taliban. ---  --- Mike Martin would not have the correct family, clan and tribal ties and background to carry this off. ---  --- Sorry, but Forsythe has dropped the ball on this one.
All of the people that gave this game a review of more than two stars are bs-ing you.  Those people are probably hardcore ff7 fans - that game was barely mediocre at best.  Other ff7 releases = advent children, cell phone game, and movie/tv show thing.  All three things, resectively, sucked.  Now comes, "Dierge of Cerberus"  whoop did eeee doo!!  The only reason why I rented it was because the title says, "final fantasy" in it.  The only redeeming quality of this game is the cutscenes - other than that, boring.  If you can get more than 20 minutes through the game, then by all means, it's the game for you
Normally I might wait to install a new software upgrade, but I just got a new laptop and thought it would be best to use Office 2007 with the new Vista operating system. I was wrong. ---  --- You would expect that a multi-billion dollar company like Microsoft could put out a powerful and bug-free piece of software. But after a month of using Office 2007, you get the distinct impression that this software is not ready for public release. Microsoft should be ashamed. ---  --- I don't know the root cause of my problems, but I have to stress that I am running a clean install of Office 2007 on Vista, so there shouldn't be any software conflicts or issues.  ---  --- So what are my issues? The list is long: ---  --- -- My biggest concern is that MS Word constantly hangs and stalls. It can making editing a document very painful. I suspect the problem is when I put images or Visio diagrams into a document. But that is something the old MS Word was able to do without an issue. Oddly, if I have a colleague open the document and save it out in Word 2003, the problem goes away! What?! It's killing my productivity. ---  --- -- When ever I cut and paste from an old document, Word hangs for 15 to 20 seconds. And often the formatting and margins in my new document go haywire. I keep having to spend a ton of time fixing things. This never happened in the old Word. This is another time killer. ---  --- -- Every few days, Outlook 2007 starts telling me that it cannot display my email folders. Uh oh! I have to completely restart my computer to see my email again. ---  --- -- Outlook 2007 breaks many graphic emails that people send -- they look like a mess. It is because Outlook 2007 does NOT render HTML correctly since it uses the Word engine, not Internet Explorer to display email. I have no idea why Microsoft did this, but they have got to fix it. ---  --- -- Many of the issues in the old Word 2003 still haven't been fixed. If you place an image, it can often be hard to get it to appear correctly. Why can't they solve this one? ---  --- -- While most Office programs have the new ribbon interface (which I like), some programs like Visio 2007 do not. So you have to remember how to use two interfaces. Couldn't Microsoft find the time and money to update ALL its programs? Give me a break. ---  --- -- On a few occassions in Visio 2007, my files have failed to save correctly. At first I thought this must have been my fault, but it's happened to me a few times and can't be a coincidence. A few times I've gotten an error message and lost my work. Ug. ---  --- -- Word and Excel 2007 use a completely new file format. So anyone you send a document to has to have 2007 installed (which isn't likely the case). To get around this, you can save it down to a 2003 file format, but then you end up with two files on your hard drive -- one in the new format and one in the old format. What a pain! Also, there definitely seems to be an issue with Office 2007 opening older Office 2003 files. Could be the cause of many of my problems, but there is no way I can avoid using old files. They should have worked harder on compatibility. ---  --- There are good things about the new 2007. I do like the new interface design and the new features in Outlook 2007 are amazing for organizing tasks and sharing your calendar. ---  --- But I don't think it's fair that Microsoft released a product so full of serious, serious bugs that have cost me hours and hours of extra work. I didn't spend hundreds of dollars on a beta product and don't think the public should have to suffer. Surely they can afford to do better! ---  --- NEW ADDITION TO MY REVIEW: --- Today I discovered that I can no longer paste Excel charts into Word like I used to. When I try, the chart goes in, but any bars/lines disappear. 
it exceeded my expectation. it looks great and seems quite sturdy. i bought for casual days when i am either skiing or just hanging out on a weekend. i like it
The Kerastase line is hard to find (used to be only sold in Kerastase salons, I believe.) The shampoos do EXACTLY what they say. In this case, this is a moisturizing shampoo for dried hair that may be overly chemically treated. I only wish they came in larger bottles
THE CLOSURE FOR THE EARINGS WAS NOT SECURE, AS A RESULT, EVERYTIME ANYTHING BRUSHED AGAINST YOUR EAR THE CLOSURE CAME UNDONE AND, WITHIN TWO WEEKS, I LOST ONE EARING. ---  --- THIS TYPE OF CLOSURE IS NOT PRACTICLE FOR ANYONE WHO IS REMOTELY ACTIVE
I bought one of these summer 2005. This unit runs way too hot to use as a smoker (easily 250-300 degrees F). I even got a replacement regulator from the mfctr, but both ran too hot. I've had some success controlling temperature with valve on LP tank and a C clamp on the gas hose, but only limited luck. I've tried using an electric hot plate burner, but that only worked in warm weather and barely got above 200 degrees. Hate to say it, but would recommend you invest your money elsewhere.
I don't think customer Lee Kane is quite right when he says that Tag Gallagher's labour-of-love book is mainly about the films.  Gallagher's writing is spare and lean but he gives at least as much biography as the purely biographical books
I live in a apt in nyc, so roaches are very common problem. After a long battle I finally got rid of the roaches in my place, but I cannot escape the bugs visiting from other apartments. I thought this device could help with that problem. Also, I don't like to use the spray too often or have all the baits, gels, and other poisons around, so I decided to try these things. Unfortunately, they don't work. The first week I bought them I saw a big roach crawl under the door and walk directly under the repeller straight to the dining room. The ultrasonic frequency did nothing to it. Instead of this repeller I use Limonel (orange peel oil) is a safe alternative to use when children are present, and it does repell and kill the bugs. --- So, how to get rid of roaches? Seal every crack nook and cranny with expansive foam, wood sealer, etc. Mine came in through the bathroom and kitchen vents, so I put mosquito screens to block their way in, also I sealed the gaps between the wall and the electrical outlets in the apt with silicone and I bought a plastic stripe that closes the gap between the door and the floor. Also, my husband sprays once every 4 months with repellent. Good luck
Well, the other reviews tell you that the shaver works great [compared to other battery operated shavers]. I agree. ---  --- My point is that one can buy Lithium batteries for about a dollar each. Google for LED flashlight reviews and you will find highg quality cheap Lithium batteries. Some of them were even tested and evaluated by the flashlight guys
This compass is better than I thought it would be especially for the price.  It's a great deal.  I purchased it for a car and it work well for it
I had a check engine light problem with my car. I purchase the meter and it was able to determine the problem via the code. I was able to fix the problem with 1/4 of what the dealer charges. The meter saved me hundreds of dollars. Highly recommend it
I have just recieved my pair of boxer-briefs for my son.  I took A kid's review's idea and got one size smaller for my son.  I asked him how they felt and he said that they felt really good.  I asked him if they give him enough support and he said yes and he even told me, I don't know why, but he told me that he can get his hand down the boxer-briefs and take it out without the boxer-briefs streching and loosing their tightness
If this is the generation I am supposed to belong to, I want to disown it.  Ben Stiller's directorial debut centers on four friends recently graduated from collage, and are now trying to find their way in the world.  The movies messege is that we are a lost generation, but that is not are parent's fault (where this movie tries to lay the blame).  The kids in this movie are just lazy, more or less.  And they spend their free time trying to make meaning out of their lives.  Indeed, Troy (Ethan Hawke) even tries to ratinalize stealing a candy bar by saying society ows him.  Winona Ryder plays waify Lelina, who makes a documentry out of recorded footage she has of her friends.  One day she meets Michael (Ben Stiller) who is their age but has made a good career out of the TV industry.  Ethan hates him for his honest approach to life, and so the battle for Lelina's love begins.  I really wasn't too impressed with this movie, it just made it seem like my peers are just wallowing in self pity for the sake of being the cool, tortured artist; when they should get off the couch and go get a job
These socks are advertised as seamless toe socks. They are very thin and they DO have a very uncomfortable seam in the toe. Not only does the seam press into the toe, but you can feel the inner seam of the shoe itself. Terrible product
Canon makes a great underwater housing for a reasonable price.  I purchased this for a recent trip to Grand Cayman and Cozumel.  I didn't go Scuba diving on this trip, but I did take the camera snorkeling (diving to depths ~20ft).  It worked flawlessly and I got some pictures I was very happy with!  One thing I did not anticipate was the use the camera got out of the water.  Going from AC to the hot humid outdoors, my EOS rebel fogged up (condensation) and even after 30 minutes I couldn't take good pictures.  With the SD110 in the UW housing, I just wipped the housing's glass portal with a lens tissue after it had warmed up a couple of minutes and I was able to take clear pictures.  ---  --- The instructions are pretty good, but it took me a while to figure out how to take out the O-ring seal for cleaning/lubing.  Once I figured it out, it wasn't so hard. ---  --- The SD110 may be getting a little old, but it still takes decent pictures and even with the housing I don't have so much money tied up in the system that I would be devestated if it was lost or stolen.  I will probably upgrade to the SD550 or SD500 (they both use the same batteries as the SD110) with the WP-DC80 or WP-DC70 housing at some time in the near future, but I will definitely keep the SD110 and WP-DC10 as backups
If you like movies as I do, this DVD set should satisfy any film fanatic with over 21 (that's right) extra features--clearly a prototype of what we film fans want in our DVD sets.  ---  --- To see producer Irwin Allen in his Rolls Royce and a pink polyester leisure suit (complete with white shoes) discussing the finer points of 'The Poseidon Adventure" and "Towering Inferno" as he takes us on a tour through 20th Century Fox is as informative as it is funny.  ---  --- Commentaries by film historian F.X. Feeney and SFX director, Mike Vezina, add another dimension to understanding this interesting film.   ---  --- Much has already been written about this film itself by the other Amazon critics here, suffice to say the acting in this motion picture (save for the two little brats in Jennifer Jones' charge) is quite good with Newman as the architect and and McQueen as the fire captain, both excellently cast.  Then again, when have these actors ever disappointed audiences in their respective roles?  ---  --- Veterans Faye Dunaway and Bill Holden rarely disappoint, Richard Chamberlain is downright creepy, and even Fred Astaire (at 80 years of age when this was made) manages to inject some needed satire here and there as he tries to woo Jennifer Jones. For those from the SF Bay Area, the setting for this movie was San Francisco and the distinctive lobby of the Hyatt Regency at Embarcadero was used for many of the scenes in the first half of the movie.  ---  --- Ok, this is not going to be a long review, and the film does not really impart any substantial revelations about life and death. I could get very deep and argue that the film is a metaphor to man's vanity and ego dedicated to the capitalistic excesses of power, wealth and greed, but let's get real--it's just one damn exciting movie with excellent special effects (Academy Awards for Cinematography and Editing), reasonably good acting all around, and edge-of-your-seat entertainment.    ---  --- I just hope they don't make another remake a la "The Poseidon Adventure" for this film--Irwin Allen's rendition will do just fine. 
I'm the first to confess that I had never heard any of any of the actors starring in the 1951 Robert Wise gothic noir, The House on Telegraph Hill, but it doesn't matter, because all the actors are good, and combined with an extremely effective plot, the movie is a terrific tale of murder, deceit and assumed identities in post world war San Francisco.  ---  --- As was the fashion with many noir films of the time, The House on Telegraph Hill is told in flashback with a voice over from the heroine. She tells of her house that is empty and is up for sale, and one immediately assumes that something terrible has happened. However, the narrative soon jumps to Germany at the end of the War, and we meet Victoria Kopwelska (Valentina Cortese) is a Polish woman imprisoned in Belsen. ---  --- With her husband and family dead, Victoria tells the kindly American commander Major Marc Bennett (William Lundigan) that there's nothing for her back in Poland. Desperate to survive, Victoria learns that her best friend has family in the United States, and if they are ever freed, she promises to take Victoria to America with her. Her friend however, is killed shortly before American troops can liberate the camp.  ---  --- With nowhere to go, Victoria hatches a scheme to steal her friend's papers and sail to America, where she learns now the godmother to a young boy Chris (Gordon Gebert), as well as the heir to a sizable fortune, and a gorgeously gothic house high atop Telegraph Hill, following the death of her "aunt." Ensconced in the ostensible mansion, Victoria, now dressing in glamorous frocks and drinking expensive champagne marries the boy's guardian Alan Spender (Richard Basehart), partly out of desperation and partly out of the need for security. ---  --- As Victoria becomes a "mother" to the boy, she clashes with his governess Margaret (Fay Baker) and coincidently reconnects with Marc whom she met a Belsen, now a studly a playboy type lawyer.  All the adults are not as they seem: Marc has been making secret plans to get his hands on the money, and Victoria's arrival causes him to draft a new scheme.  Victoria begins to believe that her new sweetheart is up to no good. And then there's the Margaret, the furtive outsider and whether her allegiances to Chris are all they seem.  ---  --- The film is compelling, and tension-fuelled and beautifully shot in black and white. Cortese is especially good in one of her first American roles and as Victoria, she frantically tries to keep up her masquerade, yet through no fault of her own, she steadily becomes a victim of Alan's scheming.  ---  --- Of particular note are the stunning location shots of San Francisco. The main house is just beautiful and the scenes when Victoria is playing baseball with Chris offer stunning views of San Francisco Bay. The House on Telegraph Hill ultimately serves as one of the better noir thrillers - there's a runaway car, poisoned orange juice, an enigmatic and jealous housekeeper and a false identity. It all makes for a gripping and entertaining film.  ---  --- Victoria starts out as a victim, and although she schemes and lies her way into the house on Telegraph Hill, her ability to rise above the nefarious misdeeds enable her to achieve a kind of redemption for both her and Chris.

The story here dosen't matter. The main characters fuse into a missle of meth and insanity towards an explosive ending. Scwartzman escapes his fate temporarily and murphy is blessed with a reprieve but rourke pays the full price for his evil concoction, meth. Quirky directing and film editing can be somewhat distracting but not meaningless. Roberts is so gay you want to smack his face. he an rourke have history on film and play out their familiarity. Rourke is phenomonal again as an immoral genius, a role he plays better than anyone today in film. BR
This is a highly informative and accurate book.  It presents the data in a clear and graphic form, with a minimum of statistical manipulation.  The studies cited by the previous reviewer, Lloyd Rowsey, are based on econometric modeling.  Since the one he mentions, two other econometric models of abortion and homicide have been published with opposite results.  One is by Ted Joyce, the other by John Lott and John Whitney.  Econometric modeling can prove anything.  If you want to understand crime in America in the 1990s, buy The Crime Drop
THIS ALBUM IS OKAY --- NOT THEIR BEST. --- A FEW SONGS ARE GOOD --- OTHER THAN  --- THAT THIS ALBUM  --- IS FAIR.PURCAHSE IT WITH YOUR --- MONEY INTELLIGENTLY!!!!!!!!
These shoes are so comfortable and cute! I've gotten a lot of compliments on them, and I like their old-school Pony look
I purchased this item to show my work to potential buyers. I found that it is effective to show many of my pieces, and the materials used to make this folder is exceptional.  Very professional looking and easy to carry around.  If you have a ton of items then they tend to get tangled, but I don't believe it is intended for that purpose
This is one of the worst movies ever! It seems to just have been an excuse for the actress and her director husband to show off her naked body
This workout is nice because it doesn't mess around.  There are no long introductions you can't fast-forward through and the workout itself is challenging both the abdominal and breath series and the side series (which is all legs and hips) are really challenging and I plan on doing them to keep my muscles toned even after delivery.  One complaint is that apparently she releases the videos herself and they aren't available very widespread in retail stores.  I also would have liked it if they had included more arm work or a postnatal workout.  All in all though great
One of the funniest magazines around.  In a recent article, the Weekly Standard proposed massively expanding the IRS to help pay for the massive debt and budget deficit.  Which group did the "Weekly Standard" say should be targeted for this increased IRS presence (and massive increase in tax rate - for some 100%)? The Entertainment Industry.  The reality tv show contestants, the teen-pop singers and the like.  The article noted that normally massive taxation would hurt an industry, but with all the people that really want fame, that go all out to get their 15 minutes of fame, the industry would continue along (I'm curious if O'Rourke realizes that the tax would be applied to similar writers).  Another O'Rourke article provided the readers with an alternate Inaugural Address by Bush (subtitle: "What if George W. Bush weren't a compassionate conservative . . ."; quote: "The media say that I won the election on the strength of moral values.  If the other fellow had become president, would the media have said that he won the election on the strength of immoral values?"). ---  --- In all seriousness, this magazine is a very clear detailed neo-conservative look at the issues (neo-con? - interestingly, it would appear that many of the writers used to be liberals).  The magazine does not always present just the conservative perspective, and does not always agree with Bush. Another recent article was by a current liberal, ex-communist British writer and his reaction to George Galloway's testimony before the US Senate. An editorial in that recent issue was all about the dictator in Uzbekistan, an US ally in the war on terror.  The editorial notes that toleration of this dictator and his brutality will undermine Bush's current foreign policy. ---  --- It should be noted that the magazine does not seem to have journalists, and few staff writers, most appear to be called "contributing editors."  ---  --- It is jarring, though, when I read the magazine then read articles in some of my other subscriptions.  "Variety" and "Weekly Standard" rarely agree.  For that matter, I'm somewhat surprised by how often the "Weekly Standard" and "Business Week" disagree. ---  --- - Michael S. Briggs -
 --- For a mirror shine and one that doesn't disappear on the rim of a glass with the first sip my choice is MAC. Lipglass feels good on your lips, as if it contained some emollients. And (this is a big AND) it's not tacky or sticky.  ---  --- The colors are a veritable palette of shades to suit every mood, occasion and skin tone. They range from a playfully innocent baby-doll nude to a dramatic dark diva red.  ---  --- Another plus (and this is a big PLUS following the big AND) MAC Lipglass is so price accessible that you can easily pick a bouquet of these delicious shades. Try adding a Lipglass over a country cousin lipstick for a wow impact.  ---  --- Enjoy!  ---  --- Gail Cook
Perfect for my needs.  Stores well in my saddlebags.  I saw it five dollars cheaper at Auto Zone a few days after I received it but I'm still happy with the purchase
This is the first time I'm writing a review of anything on Amazon.com, but I need to warn people about this game.  It would be great except for 2 problems: --- 1.  It skip excessively. --- 2.  There is no way to easily skip past games that you've played.  So once you've taken out that DVD, put it back in and you'll recognize the questions -- you've answered them already! ---  --- Not recommended. ---  --- If I could give it negative stars, I would.  However, Amazon makes you give it at least 1
I received the XACTi a few weeks ago and it's performing like I hoped it would.  The controls are a very simple and intuitive.  All the required hardware is included.  Does not require any additional software to run on Mac or Windows. ---  --- I have a MacBook with Boot Camp running Windows XP Pro.  The camera works easily with either platform.  It is recognized as another drive and does not require any additional software to download the images and movies onto the hardrive.  I am using a SanDisk 2gb SD memory card. ---  --- Another big plus is not having to wait while downloading real-time like you would have to with miniDV.  The quality may not be the same as miniDV but the convenience and ease of use make up for the difference.  The quality is much better than a digital camera when taking movies and people will think it's just a camera by it's small size. ---  --- My old camera was a 2 mega pixel Canon Powershot A60.  This is rated at 6 mega pixel.  You can definitely see the difference in the pictures and movies.  When filming movies, the higher frames per second sample rate makes the images smooth, even when taking pictures of high speed objects like helicopter rotor blades and airplane propellers. ---  --- This is my first camcorder so I can't really compare to anything else (except my old camera) but the ease of use will make you want to use it all the time and people will start to tell you to put that thing away
This was my favorite episode as a kid.  I was so happy to see I could download it to watch with my kids
Just the perfect cap!. It fits like no other swimming cap. It won't pull you hair when removing it, neither will slip a bit from your head after swimming several laps or flip turning. Very resistant material, and a great finish. Awesome colors!
The canopy bar broke only two days after Christmas.   --- Now I have a sharp end on the bed frame.  Not good --- for little fingers.  For the price, I thought it would --- have been a lot more sturdy
Reading the reviews of this camera reminds me that cameras are tools.  An imperfect tool in the hands of a master is much better than a perfect tool in the hands of a amatuer.  I am not a master, but I do appreciate this camera for what it can do and what its limitations are.  When you use ISO settings higher than 200 you will see increased noise.  I think it is a great little camera and I have used it a lot on my latest photo project.  Keep in mind one of the assets of this camera is its small physical size.  This also means small optical lens = less light gathering ability.  There is no way to compensate for this in the camera - so know this is a limitation and deal with it.
I was a subscriber to the New Republic for several years, but in the waning years of the Clinton administration and the beginnings of the Bush II administration, the paper seemed to take a real rightward turn.  Now, I have no problem with so-called liberal hawks, but the magazine's slavish support for the war in Iraq in the face of questionable evidence did it for me.  In addition, the magazine spends more time bashing Democrats for not aligning themselves with the magazine's professed centrist/liberal slant than it does with presenting true progressives ideals that create thoughtful discourse among its readers.  The magazine has forgotten its roots of progressive intellectualism and dissent in favor of safe, "New Democrat" rhetoric.  There are better magazines our there
Excellent camera kit. Versatile. I have a lot to learn about the camera, though, as it is no simple point-and-shoot. However, in Auto mode, it takes great point-and-shoot pictures. I look forward to learning how to use it fully. Lenses came with warranty cards, but the camera itself did not. I bought the SB-600 flash as well and another battery and two 1 GB compact flash cards to round out the kit. Camera with lens attached is large, which I underestimated. $80 camera bag is too small for it all. Great camera, though. Price was the best I could find anywhere
This seemed like a great idea but it doesn't work very well for cloth diaper users, like me. I use the top shelf for the wipes warmer and the side pockets for grooming items such as a brush and cotton swabs. However, since my cloth diapers won't fit into the diaper organizer, I'm not sure what to put there. Because of this, there is a lot of wasted space.  ---    ---  I would not recommend this product if you use cloth diapers
Very disappointed, this item never got shipped to me, we waited close to 2 months to find out it wasn't coming
I purchased two of them for my twin boys, and they really love it. it is made pretty strong and can be folded easily.  The only negative point is that the wheeler can not be extended too much. so probably we will need to buy a taller one in a few years
Do not buy at this price. Ridiculous!!!  Just bought this car on ebay for 8.99.  And bought another very rare one("Mr The King") for $10.00.  These sellers are nuts!
never shipped. I ordered this before Christmas. They said it was in stock. WHERE IS IT
This is simply a beautiful magazine, printed on heavy, glossy paper. Its pages contain many beautiful photographs of different foods, wines, and the countries from which they originate. It is not only a food and wine magazine with wonderful recipes that are easy to follow, it is also a travel guide of sorts with a great deal of information on other countries, their food and wine, their  restaurants, and their culture. Usually included are some fascinating historical details of how a custom associated with a particular food may have come about. The articles are invariably well-written and offer a wealth of fascinating information.   ---  --- I am a tea lover, and I love going to afternoon tea with its repast of scones, dainty sandwiches, and light cakes. So, I particularly enjoyed an article that the magazine recently had that focused on tea. It transported the reader to Devon, England with its afternoon tradition of  tea and scones, accompanied by clotted cream and  jam, which is often referred to as a cream tea. Of course, a beautiful bone china tea pot and bone china cups are essential to the having of a proper cup of tea. This, too, is discussed in the article. Photographs of an authentic village tearoom in Devon were included, as well as recipes for making scones, tea sandwiches, black currant jam, strawberry jam, and Victoria Sponge Cake.    ---  --- The article went on to discuss how clotted cream is made. It interspersed the discussion with personal anecdotes from those who make clotted cream. A guide was included for Devon in terms of where to stay, where to eat, and where to go for tea. The article went on to discuss the differences among the various available tea experiences, detailing what constitutes an afternoon tea, a cream tea, and a high tea, and giving some of the historical underpinnings of each.  I so enjoyed this article! Even if I never physically go to Devon, I feel as if the magazine had transported me there, as it was vividly drawn by so expert and sure a hand. The magazine has these types of articles in every issue, covering regions from all over the world, including those in the United States.   ---  --- The magazine also contains a helpful section titled, "The Pantry", which is a guide to resources that have to do with food products and kitchenware related to articles in the current issue of the magazine. This makes it invariably easier for the reader, who may wish try some of the more esoteric recipes, to find what one needs. It is little wonder that I love this magazine. Those who are interested in wonderful food, excellent and easy to follow recipes, other cultures and customs, as well as traveling, will simple adore this magazine. It makes a wonderful gift. I know, because this magazine was a gift to me and one for which I am grateful, as it is a gift that one gets to enjoy again and again, each and every month. 
As a dentist I am in very close physical contact with my patients.  This is the only fragrance I wear because it is light yet feminine and does not bother my patients.  I receive so many compliments every time I wear it.
It is over a hundred dollars but put it off this is the book. You won't need any others
I'm all about lip plumping glosses and this one sucked.  It has a really slippery constistancy and did not plump my lis at all.  I'll stick with my Too Faced lip injection products
Asks the interviewer, "What place would you give Shoot the Piano Player in relation to your other films?" Answers director François Truffaut, "No place. Simply the second film I made." Considering his first feature film was The Four Hundred Blows and his third was Jules et Jim, Truffaut's matter-of-factness and lack of pretense is worth a smile.  ---  --- Shoot the Piano Player is worth smiles, too. It's a clever film, playful at times, even funny. More than anything, however, it defies categorization. The movie is a strange and successful amalgamation of crime and comedy, suspense and inevitability, tragedy and love, and gangsters, girl friends and violence. It's the story of Charlie Koller (Charles Aznavour), a piano player in a Paris dive, who used to be Eduoard Saroyan, a famous pianist, whose wife committed suicide. Truffaut says the movie is a film about a shy man. Charlie is the kind of shy man who cannot bring himself to touch the hand of a woman he wants. He can't go back and open the door to the room where he left his wife sobbing. He thinks about what he should do, but can't do it, and then circumstances take over. Charlie, thanks to his brothers, finds himself in a gangland underworld where double-crossing is going to lead to a shootout in the snow. Some say Shoot the Piano Player is an homage to American gangster films. Perhaps it is, but I challenge anyone to spend much time considering this possibility while watching the movie. The film is original, funny, moving and sad. It's the kind of film that people who love movies write essays about. All I know is that I was moved by Charlie. We leave him where we met him, playing piano in a Paris dive. ---  --- Charles Aznavour, a diminutive man with a hangdog look, plays Charlie perfectly. Aznavour is probably better known in the U. S. as a singer, but in France he's seen as both an actor and a singer. He's a minimalist, he says about himself. Charlie thinks too much and does too little. Aznavour lets us see into Charlie's soul with few words. It's a marvelous performance that left me saddened by Charlie, but liking him. ---  --- The Criterion DVD transfer is first-rate. Criterion gives us two discs. The first has the movie and a commentary track. The second disc contains interviews by Aznavour and Marie Dubois, who played Charlie's girlfriend, Lena, plus excerpts from documentaries featuring Truffaut, and other extras. The Criterion case contains a 28 page booklet with substantial material on the film and Truffaut
This is a wonderful (and healthful) snack.  Crispy and tasty and low in calories. Each bag equals 1/2 cup of fresh fruit, and the dried crunchiness of these seems to intensify the flavor of the fruits.  There is also enough substance to meet the munchies moments.  I highly recommend these
This device worked great for a short span of time (a few weeks), then just stopped working.  I returned it to Amazon and received a new replacement.  It worked fine for a while, then stopped working.  It's a great idea, but very weak quality
out of all the hair striaghters I have owned and I have gone through about 6 this is the best one yet! I really like it! it straightens my hair perfectly, and you cant beat the price
madden comes out again, but with some stupid lead blocking controls. i think this is as dumb as tha qb vision controls.y cant they come out with something good
These came yesterday and I started using them right away. I was able to learn (for recognition only) 12 new JLPT3 kanji in under 30 minutes so this product is definitely worth it. Before using this I learned all JLPT4 kanji by writing it over and over again on scratch paper. That was a more thorough method but Ive decided that for now, recognition is more important than writing so WRP flashcards are a big help.  ---  --- As others have noted, they have a nice look and feel to them. All Nihongo students should have this in their arsenal. You'll definitely have an advantage over fellow classmates who waste valuable time making their own flashcards.
I was fortunate not to spend any money specifically on this movie.  I couldn't get past the first 15 minutes... incoherent beginning, and overly stylized particularly where Ashe becomes "the avenger" (for lack of a better name).  Nothing like the original at all, which I love by comparison
This strap is thinner than those used in yoga classes.  It is sharp on the arch when held there for poses.  I would not purchase another one. 
nice CD cool beats songs like Welcome To Atlanta pick it u
This was a film I was anticipating becuase of the actors doing the voice over and the special effects.  As far as animated features go this was the biggest dissappointment.  The acting was good but Robin Williams did not receive as much screen time as Ewen McGreagor which meant it wasant as funny as it could have been.  But the major problem was the story.  Yes, it did have a good moral but the rest of the films story was weak, boring at times and just silly.  I would recommend Ice Age or Garfiled: The Movie rather than this film
The software requires a "patch"...not a big deal. ---  --- Once I got the thing up and running my attention span was about 5 minutes.  The "goofiness" is a detriment and the aspect of trying to learn is hindered by the balance of trying to figure out how to use the software. ---  --- It has a tutorial but that is a waste of time as well. ---  --- If you are SERIOUS about trying to learn some basic conversational Spanish, try something else.  Don't waste your time or money on this one..
There is only one thing that any self respecting geek loves more than Dungeons and Dragons and that is Star Wars.  This game is the marriage of those two wonderful geeky things. It is a flawless game
I really, really enjoyed this game.  It was the only game I played for almost 2 months, I was so hooked on it.  My only criticism is that the missions are too rigid, so the outcomes are very much the same during re-play, even if you make different choices.  I thought it was really neat that the character changes according to what you do - e.g. too much eating, and he gets fat.
Appears to be a good product with one major exception. You can't even charge it for first use without getting an extension cord to plug into 110v power. Required cord must have only one plug in where as most cords today come with a plug on the end that will let you plug in more than one item. The blades on the jump starter are resessed so the extension cord must have only one place to plug anything or the fitting is to big to go into the recess. Got this as a present and so far the report is that an old type cord is hard to find.  --- I find it unbelievable that any company producing this item would not include 4 feet of cheap cord so the product could be put in service at once
Adobe has totally re-done the interface to streamline it and make it cleaner from versions prior to CS.  If you are a QuarkXpress user, you'll find that in InDesign CS2, you get the feeling that it is laid out in a logical and easy-to-use manner.  The tools and tool palettes are where you'd expect them to be in the menu structure and on the screen.  Small touches like being able to save your workspace, like you can do in Photoshop CS2, are great. ---  --- I tested the integration between InDesign CS2 and some of its counterparts in the Adobe Creative Suite Premium.  I created different graphics in Photoshop CS2 and Illustrator CS2 and I found it was really easy to import them into InDesign CS2 and use.  You can effects like drop shadows and feathering to images directly in InDesign CS2.  No need to go to another program.  With the Control Palette you can also resize objects too.  This palette functions with Transform and Stroke features for graphics, and it includes paragraph, character and table features for text editing.  What the palette does is affected by the type of selection you have made - either graphic or text.  ---  --- I imported some formatted text in from Microsoft Word 2003 and two different tables in from Microsoft Excel 2003.  I was concerned how the tables would appear after the import from Microsoft Excel.  The tables imported easily. With InDesign CS2, you can now automatically style Microsoft Word files on import by mapping Word styles to InDesign CS2 styles as well. ---  --- An issue for a long time has been how to preview or view other types of files that you want to incorporate with InDesign CS2.  Now, Adobe "bridges" that gap.  Bridge now comes as a part of InDesign CS2 and the Premium Suite.  So, viewing any Adobe-type formatted file or standard graphic format is easy to do.  Using the same interface between the different programs is a help as well.  Adobe Bridge is a standalone program. ---  --- Being a Web Designer and using Adobe (formerly Macromedia) Dreamweaver 8, I was familiar with using Snippets.  These are portions of code you can save for use in other programs or you can export them to give to someone else.  Now,  InDesign CS2 offers this Snippet capability.  You can export objects as snippets. These objects can be shared or reused in other documents. Simply place or drag a snippet into a layout, and  InDesign re-creates the original objects, their formatting, and their relative positioning on the page.  No more wasted time redesigning, just to get something you have brought in from another document to fit. ---  --- InDesign CS2 also now has an Info palette that is just like those found in Photoshop and Illustrator.  Size dimensions and resolution are immediately available by selecting the graphic and simply glancing over to the Info palette.  This is a crucial tool when fitting graphics in a specifically space-limited area.  It's important to know the actual dimensions with which you are working. ---  --- Sometimes in designing and re-designing printed work, you have to move objects.  When this happens, your structure can often change in different ways.  InDesign CS2 helps you maintain your layout by allowing you to anchor your callouts, pull quotes, margin notes, and graphics to text. You can now precisely control the positioning of Anchored Objects, apply text wrap settings, and more. ---  --- As with other Adobe products, it is very easy to export your finished work in PDF format.  InDesign CS2 works so well at exporting to PDF, it even maintains the layers in Acrobat 7.  You can pre-define your Acrobat export settings as well.  InDesign CS2 also supports specialty PDF formats like PDF/X-1a and PDF/X-3, which are used in workflows.  It also supports high-resolution CMYK output and color-managed workflows. ---  --- If you are familiar with previous versions of InDesign, the upgrade to the new version is easy.  InDesign CS2 is even backwards compatible CS.  You will find that your learning curve is greatly decreased. ---  --- Loren Elks, Group Manager --- D-MAG.or
This movie is basically about 12 yr. old boys crying with each other.  When does that ever happen?  The dialogue is completely unbelievable considering the age of these kids.  What 12 yr. old worries about "..never getting out of this small town."?   --- I guess if your childhood consisted of sitting around and crying with your friends, then you might enjoy this movie in some lame nostalgic sense.  I have a feeling Oprah would like this movie. 
The Unbox video version of this film for Tivo is useless. Only after purchasing it did I discover that this film can only be downloaded to a Tivo a certain number of times in a certain time period. For more than the cost of the DVD, I'm restricted in when, where and how I can watch this movie. Nothing like being treated like a criminal by the movie studios.  ---  --- I will not purchase another Tivo Unbox film.
I have to say this is a game that was worth every dollar spent!   It's a game that I will keep for life and probably play again someday! I don't know what the previous Final Fantasy games were like so for me there is no comparison. I think I'm totally biased toward Final Fantasy X. The two coolest aspects about this game, for me, are the Aeons and Blitzball. The other thing I like about this game is the storyline, the characters and the beautiful scenary. I forgot to mention how great the music is also. I've been reading reviews about current and previous Final Fantasy games and the thing that is still missing for me is, the Aeons and Blitzball. I'm also attached to the characters in Final Fantasy X. Even the sequel doesn't cut it for me right now. For me, it's Final Fantasy X all the way
Quite possibly one of the worst movies of all time. Clive Owen is really cool, but not in this movie. Angelina Jolie's polital agenda totally fueled this film. What a waste of time
This game is really good! I have a real up-to-date computer so everything runs fast and smooth. The multiplayer is great! You can play 1,000's of people in a huge number of maps and game styles. You can even type a message to your team or for everyone to hear! One of the down points is that in multilayer, someone may have modded a map to mess up the game or give them unlimited ammo and you get nothing. Another thing would be the lag. This is where the game moves real "choppy" or you lose the network connection. Still, its a really fun game
this is a tiny, compact watch with elegant design. it is fit for the women attending the formal parties. plus, it works great. this price deserves its value
I have been buying this stuff since the wholesale club had opened in my town seven years ago.  I was horrified this past Thanksgiving to find out they no longer carried it.  I tried to improvise with garlic powder and Italian seasoning, but my homemade ravioli were not nearly as good as they had been in the past.  I can't say enough great things about this stuff.  I use it to season burgers, steak, to spread over chicken with a little olive oil before baking and grilling and in all of my stuffed pasta dishes.  It's not just great, it's AMAZING!!
  This reveals a great deal about Vietnam and the 1960's. --- Should be prized by students of Kennedy, Johnson, and our military history in the nuclear age
This was a gift for my son who is learning trumpet in his middle school band.  Purchasing it was cheaper than renting one for the year.  We are by no means musical experts, but he can play it as well as the expensive instrument we were renting (valued at $900), and it sounds the same to me.  The mouthpiece is a bit smaller than his former trumpet and that took a bit of adjustment, but now he has no problem with it.  The case isn't real high quality but with proper care should be fine in the long run
I love Twinings, but 300 packets of it are a bit too much to purchase at one time. There needs to be an option for smaller packaging with this product.
First, let me say that Ahmad tea is great tea for the price.  This is not quite the same thing as great tea, but given the "price/performance" of Ahmad tea, I should rightly rate it four or even five stars. ---  --- So why only two stars? ---  --- Amazon claims you'll get the following six teas in each pack:  "Ceylon Orange Pekoe; English Breakfast; Earl Grey; Darjeeling; English No. 1; Jasmine Green" ---  --- But instead of Jasmine Green, I got English Afternoon tea. ---  --- What you might not realize is that Ahmad's English Afternoon and English Tea No. 1 contain Bergamot.  This is a citrus oil used to make Earl Grey, which is also included.   ---  --- English Afternoon and English Tea No. 1 are both Earl Greys.  The bergamot might be slightly weaker than in a traditional Earl Grey, but it's still obviously there.  So half of this package is Earl Grey. ---  --- I don't really like Earl Grey tea.   ---  --- If you really like Earl Grey teas, you might enjoy this.  Otherwise stay far away
As the name implies, this is about the elements of programming style. The examples are a bit dated (old languages, not C/C++/Java/the-next-great-language). But this isn't a *language* programming book, it is about how to write good programs in any language
very excellent flavor.  I gave my son a few packets, and he said that his 9-month-old grabbed some off his plate.  A lttle spicy, but excellent over Jasmine rice
I received these earrings as a gift, and I don't know what they are made of, but I get an awful lot of compliments on them.  They seem to change color in response to what I am wearing.  I would definitely order other Silver Insanity items
The mask is WAY too tight, either that, or I just have an abnormally big head which I don't think I do.  It should be adjustable, and it's not.  Would not recommend this
I enjoyed Francis Veber's 'The Closet' - released in France in 2001 - for two reasons.  First, it features an all-star ensemble of French acting, certainly a tribute to Veber's skill as a director.  Just take a gander at the first six names to appear on the IMDB credits: ---  --- Daniel Auteuil ....  François Pignon  --- Gérard Depardieu ....  Félix Santini  --- Thierry Lhermitte ....  Guillaume  --- Michèle Laroque ....  Mlle Bertrand  --- Michel Aumont ....  Belone, the neighbour  --- Jean Rochefort ....  Kopel, the director  ---  --- Imagine a movie where the great Jean Rochefort gets slotted sixth.  Each of these six stars can carry a movie in France on their own back.  The fact that the group has teamed here is a testament to Veber's reputation.  His previous release, 1998's 'The Dinner Game,' was lauded far and wide as a comedic masterpiece.  Actors get attracted to that type of skill. ---  --- The second reason I got a kick out of watching 'The Closet':  I just learned that 'Bend It Like Beckham' writing partners Gurinder Chadha and Paul Mayeda Berges are prepping a UK re-make for the screen for a targeted 2006 release, with Chadha at the helm.  Her keen eye for comedy tinged with poignancy was confirmed by Beckham's runaway success, so I feel like I'm in on a really great secret knowing she's working on a re-make. --- 
I made the mistake of ordering a $7.00 battery and I thought my phone was broken because of the way it was acting. I replaced my new battery with this new battery and now it works like a champ. So word to the wise... Just get this battery and you will not have my problems. Well worth it
I have enjoyed many of Mark's novels (Do You Know That I Love You is my favorite of the bunch), all the time recognizing his severe limitations as a writer.   ---  --- Every character in every Roeder novel speaks with the same voice--all of them, and though his dialog is usually age appropriate for his teen characters, his narrative passages invariably sound as if they were written by someone decades older.  There is frequent repetition and redudancy; characters never say anything once if they can say it two or three or four times (though he has definitely improved since his mediocre first novel Ancient Prejudice, which had the unfortunate distinction of glamorizing teen suicide).  His characters always (and I mean always) mate for life, which is a beautiful romantic ideal, but ultimately can get tiresome (gay teens are no different from straight ones in their need to play the field a bit before a lifetime commitment).   ---  --- All that said, at his best (DYKWIK, A Better Life, Keeper of Secrets) Mark Roeder writes a compelling and often un-put-downable story.   ---  --- But in Outfield Menace, the bad most definitely outweighs the good.  Did Mr. Roeder do ANY research into the time period???  The fifties are certainly a good setting for a gay teen novel (if only as an educational experience for contemporary teens, who don't realize how impossible it was to be gay at that time), but if you want to set a novel in the fifties, don't have a lead male character with a ponytail.  No one, but no one, wore a pony tail in the fifties (and certainly not in a small midwest town).  Don't have characters use anachronisms like "fifteen minutes of fame."  And most of all, don't have characters behave and think in anachronistic wasys. ---  --- Mark Roeder illustrates the dangers of self publishing.  He has apparently made a name for himself (and some money I'd guess), and I must confess, I've bought his novels (glutton for coming out stories that I am) but no legitimate house would publish his novels, at least not without major editing and rewriting, something that a self published author (especially one with an apparently inflated self image) goes without.   ---  --- There has been a renaissance in quality gay teen fiction this past year or two.  Major publishers have put out such superb young adult novels as Totally Joe, M or F?, The Hookup Artist, Rainbow Road, Boy Girl Boy.  Read them, if only to see how these truly outstanding (and published by legit houses) novels could teach Mark Roeder a thing or two.   ---  --- If you must read Roeder, then stick with his better novels and avoid this serious misstep.  Memo to Roeder: if you want to write about a time you don't know about, do your research
First off, those of you calling it a "clip" should know that a clip is a nonremovable ammunition storage device attatched to or built into the gun itself. Please call it a magazine (actual name for it) And a full metal jacket isnt a full magazine of amunition its a bullet with a full metal casing like say 30-06 round. Second, dont complain about the scope because it is a decorative instrument. you can buy better scopes if your hardcore but if you are hardcore then get a real gun. this gun is good for shooting your little cousin from far away. Its a great gun dont get me wrong but its not meant to be used and abused like a ww2 garand or bar. It's plastic, it shoots things. I'm probably reinstating most of what everyone else said but thats just one more reassurance. So yeah get this gun if airsoft is a hobby for you. NOT A SPORT. I also suggest getting .20g bbs and maybe a speedloader or 2 cause mags are so expensive and this gun pours ammo like water. Have fun. ---  --- P.S. Though they may noth have the trigger finger ability, spring airsoft guns have a tendency to be more accurate and fire harder with heavier bb's. If you are playin with friends i suggest getting a $30 dollar rifle with 250-300 fps (shoots like 300-350
After a good deal of shopping both online and in retail stores we are delighted with the product, price, and service through amazon.com  -- I recomend this watch highly
I never adjusted a watch band before and I thought it was going to be difficult after reading the other reviews on the other watch tools. This tool could not have made it any easier, I didn't break any pins and I adjusted two watch bands the night it arrived with ease. You will need a pair of needle nose pliers to pull the watch pin completely out of the band. I adjusted an Accutron Lady's York and a Swiss Army Men's Maverick. I used the tool to remove and replace the watch pins, just line the pins and squeeze the pliers slowly. The accutron used solid pins and the Swiss Army used pins that looked like they were screws but were pins that are cut or bent in half so always push from the end that looks like a screw head
Now I am a firm believer that breakfast is a very important time in your day. Yesterday morning I was driving to the dentist's office when I realized that I had forgotten to eat. I started to have quite an anxiety attack, so I pulled over at the only available place. A Gas Station. Nothing really caught my eye as something I would like to put inside my body. Now this was no ordinary Gas Station. This was a special kind of one where they had hot food behind the counter, including supreme-pizza, chicken drum-sticks, and even breakfast-style food, like a little sausage-egg-buiscuit-combo-sandwich. Sure, the food smelled alright, but the thought sickened me that one of the mechanics or gas-pumpers may have had oil, grease, or even gasoline on their hands when preparing these dishes. While I was peering over the counter, trying to scope out just how filthy their hands were, something to my left caught my eye.  ---  --- It was a golden box of something called a "Powerbar". The name had me sold immediately (a food that creates power), and they were even individually sealed to prevent the repulsive hands of the workers from contaminating them. "I'm going to eat a POWERBAR" was the only thought on my mind as I purchased 4 of them on the spot. I hopped back in my VW Cabrio and sped off down Livernois towards the dentist's office.  ---  --- I unwrapped one of the Powerbars. It looked just like a normal candy-bar but the name told a different story. Just how much endurance and stamina would one of these provide, and for how long? What kind of advantages would I gain? I thought I had found my new favorite food. Finally, a food that defines Howard Tuttleman as a person. That is, until I took my first bite.  ---  --- My first bite literally took me 2 minutes to chew up enough to be able to work it down my throat. It was a tough rubbery nugget inside the chocolate that stretched out a bit like taffy. Every bite had the same grimy and bitter flavor, with an atrocious after-taste. My mouth felt like I had ingested a whole bottle of Elmer's glue, and every crevice between my teeth was gummed up with it. I reluctantly continued to eat the entire bar. My stomach began to feel as if I had eaten lead. I felt no extra power in my body. If anything, the Powerbar significantly weakened me by making me feel ill. I was convinced that I had simply picked a bad Powerbar, so I unwrapped another one to give it a second chance. By this time I was in the Dentist's parking lot. If I went in now, I could make the appointment on time, but I had to try for more Power. Big mistake. The second Powerbar was no different. It felt like the Powerbars were fighting my stomach. I finished the second Powerbar, feeling even worse.  ---  --- My third Powerbar however was the worst of the bunch. It was a different flavor, and I nearly threw-up. I felt 20 pounds heavier. My teeth and lips felt like I had been eating drywall, and were covered in chocolate and grimy nugget. I simply could NOT eat more than 2 bites of the fourth one, no matter how much I tried. It was time to go inside.  ---  --- My dentist was a little ticked-off that I was late, and got really annoyed about all of the Powerbar remains stuck in my teeth. Apparently I wasn't supposed to eat for a while before my appointment. I felt sick for the rest of the day. I gave my dog (Morris) the rest of the 4th Powerbar to see if it would work on a dog, but it just made his butt really powerful that night and was a real pain to clean up after. Please beware, the name of this product is deceptive, unless it is supposed to mean that the Powerbar ITSELF is powerful, and will overpower YOU. Later.  ---  --- howardtuttleman.co
This is not only Brian Eno's best album, but one of the finest albums ever made--a work of simple beauty, complex intelligence, and imagination..
I ordered this magazine as a gift for my brother almost 5 months ago and he still has not received an issue. I cannot get a straight answer from anyone about what is happening and I have not even been able to get my money back.  I would not recommend anyone wasting their money with this magazine unless they can find a legitimate web site to get it from. ---  --- Kerr
Don't be deceived by the box: Dread Pirate LOOKS like a really cool game with exceptionally made components, but it is DREADfully boring to play. The game is slow, tedious, and completely luck based, and simply no fun to play. You have been warned
I wanted to be able to shoot lots over several days without dragging a laptop with me through multiple airports. I bought two and both worked fine, right out of the box. Not the fastest card ever, but certainly large storage for the price
The glasses are well made but I found them awkward to use. They didn't fit comfortably and it took quite a bit of time to get them on. The gimmick sounded cool but didn't work well for me. Every head is different, so maybe they'll work better for you
collective soul had a few nice attempts toward pop music like dosage. The main problem i have with this album is none of the songs are hits so no airwaves and the fact that the album probably has about 7 fillers! Its just to flawed to recommend to everyone it may be if you are a diehard collective soul fans. i wouldnt lose this album but i wouldnt buy it again
I have been searching on line and elsewhere for a good camcorder as 1) a replacement for my JVC GR-D70U, which died, and 2) to go online with a video blog.  After much study and evaluation, I chose the Canon ZR800 based on a salesman's recommendation, frustration as to the number of choices which are available, and the presence of an external microphone jack (which was one of my "must-have" options).  After returning home, I read the review by Miamian "New Reviewer", and felt trepidation.  After charging the battery, I tried the camera.  Lo and behold, Miamian is right.  There is an obvious noise when recording, which was not present in my JVC.  Hoping against hope, I played the tape back, and, just as I feared, the tape had a pronounced hiss.  This is not just tape hiss, but a much more pronounced noise, which transfers to the TV when watching.  It rendered the camcorder totally unacceptable. I took the camcorder back, and, like Miamian, ordered the Sony DCH-HC38.  (I know, it doesn't have an external microphone jack, but after all this confusion, I give up!! Why don't they make more cameras with them??) ---  --- The plus signs of this camera are that its menu is much more intuitively laid out, and selection of the desired item does not even require looking at the instruction book.  The joystick selector is so easy to use, to select play, rewind, fast forward, stop, pause in the playback mode,  and is also is used to select various menu items in other modes.  The wide screen viewfinder (LCD) is so nice to use, and easy to see, all others (in 4:3) become passe'. ---  --- I didn't have any chance to evaluate other aspects of the camera, due to the unacceptable noise which demanded rejection of the unit.  The picture looked OK; it did not greatly impress me, however, and the automatic focus appeared to be slow and very noticeable in playback. ---  --- In essence, caveat emptor; especially if you're hard of hearing.  Others watching and listening to the tape will not be
****THIS COMMENT MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!*** --- Anyone who saw this growing up has a soft spot in their hearts for it; I've encountered enough people over the course of my 37 yrs who perk up at the mention of it to be aware of its place in a lot of our memories. This has been satirized on the Simpsons, which proves it has embedded itself in the national pop culture consciousness. Anyone who has read the book its based on, the incredible "I am Legend" by Richard Matheson, knows that this film has very little in common with it beyond its intial premise--and even that is not followed too closely. All of the criticisms of THE OMEGA MAN are valid: It is very dated and not at all scary or intense and some of the stunts and special effects are laughably, ludicrously cheesy; the villains--who should have been more terrifying than even Romero's zombies--are just crazed albino hippie Luddites and the last half of the film, once Chuck hooks up with Rosalind Cash and the kiddies, is really a let down. But the scenes that open the film of Heston hefting a cool-looking machine gun while decked out in Austin Powers-style finery (!) staring in angst at an old calendar or losing his mind for a moment hallucinating the sound of telephones ringing in the deserted city still pack a punch. This was the second movie, after 1959's THE WORLD,THE FLESH, AND THE DEVIL, to successfully pull off the eerie effect of being the last living human being in a huge empty city. Both films established the visual motif of streets  filled with blowing waves of newspapers and swirling trash.After years of seeing this on tv -- a guaranteed late September or early October event every year for a few years on the local tv station during my Pacific Northwest childhood in the old dark ages before CABLE TV and the videocassette revolution, its nice to see this movie on DVD with a beautiful widescreen transfer. It looks and sounds great. As a child I always liked the music, particularly the "surprise party" theme that plays when the villains make thir first appearance. --- It rocks here in all its xylophone and funky electric organ and horns glory
I HAVE BOUGHT SEVERAL OF THEIR BRACELETS,BUT THIS ONE HAS A SPECIAL QUALITY TO IT,IT LOOKS SO EXPENSIVE,AND IS SO PRETTY,MATCHES EVERYTHING,WHAT CAN I SAY,I GUESSS THE LORD WAS GOOD TO ME,FINDING THIS AT A PRICE I CAN AFFORD,THE FIRST TIME I WORE IT,I GOT A COMPLIMENT,EVERYONE WANTS TO KNOW WHERE I GOT IT,I LOVE THIS BRACELET
Unfortunately installation instructions are not very clear for this item, which results in complete harm into the grill. Be careful
Just returned from a trip to Hawaii and had the opportunity to put this lens to the test.  I was very pleased with the results.  This is a powerful lens, yet it is relatively light weight and not burdensome to use.  I was able to get some really amazing wild life shots of birds, zooming in from a distance with a hand held camera (Canon EOS 20D) and virtually every shot was a keeper.  The IS feature allows you to quickly zoom and compose your shot and fire it off and the image quality is excellent with sharp focus.  Usually a lens this size with this much power requires a firm grip and almost always a tripod - not so with this one.   I shot in both portrait and landscape mode and I didn't see any problems with focus, clarity or sharpness.  All the images were clean and razor sharp.  If you are looking for a long lens with the ability to bring in a distant shot without having to use tripods and other equipment, I highly recommend this lens for your arsenal.
We bought this travel system because it is light to be lifted and comfortable but, the chest clips are so uncomfortable to close, and hard to open, specially the one that goes between the legs, it is so hard to buckle and unbuckle  that I'm afraid I'm going to hurt my baby every time we have to close or open them, and is complicated to align them to finally buckle. In fact I had an emergency with my baby and took a lot of time to open these clips
I have received no emails from ANAsuper.......No tracking number..........and extensive delivery estimate....I do not know if I should cancel order.....I am trying to give them a chance to show me their wares. --- I can understand if this product has special preparation time, but I have recieved not one communication nor confirmation. No product information
I was a little worried about spending almost 70$ on this bag, but when I recieved it I was so impressed.  I really love this bag! Very well made!! The crocadile pattern is a lot more prominent than the picture shows, but I really like it. To be honest I shy away from croc patterns, but it really works with this bag! I have a 15.4 in. Gateway laptop and it fit perfectly in this bag
I purchased this product thinking that it will be better than the hand held models or the scale type models, since it combines measurements from hands and feet for a more accurate measurement of body fat.  The scale part works normal, but the Body Fat measurement is higher by 20 - 30%, compared to Tanita BC554 scale or Omron HBF-306C hand held.  Omron, replaced the unit, but the new one is also inaccurate.  Now, I'm tying to get my money refunded, but Omron does not want to take the unit back
I used this product a few times, trying to justify the money I spent.  I could leave it on my hair all day, and the effect was essentially zilch.  Hair is dead.  It doesn't matter what propaganda beauty/cosmetics companies use to promote their products, there is no way that vitamins, minerals, etc. are going to "feed" or strengthen your hair.  When the products are washed out, so is the moisture.  It was a dumb idea on my part to think putting guacamole on my hair was going to make it a)smell good b)feel good.  And it was really dumb of me to pay so much for this stuff when I could've just as easily and much more cheaply made it myself
The ad and description clearly state that it includes both a receiver and transmitter.  I received only a receiver. This is false advertising and is patently illegal. They ought to be ashamed of themrselves
These books will one day be recorded as history told before its time. While the mainstream shurgs him now, he will be required reading years to come
I bought this product because I had tried with great success another Punch product. It was so easy to use and load onto my computer. It was a great value to be able to have one product that allows me to redesign anything from interior floors and walls, to my deck and plants outside
I started using this cream during my 2nd month of pregnancy.  I think it's important to start building the elasticity of your skin early on, which could be the reason I had success with it.  While the cream is kindof expensive-- when you think about avoiding stretchmarks, no price is too high. I used about 4 tubes for the duration.  I expected to get stretchmarks because my mom had them with me, so I was happy to get anything less than hers.  Anyway, I didn't get any at all on my stomach until the last two weeks (my baby was 8lbs. 8oz.) and they are really small.  I put the cream on my breasts and abdomen every day after a shower, but because it was expensive I skipped my sides (love handle area) and did get stretchmarks there which were darker than the ones on my stomach. Since my stomach has gone down, the ones on my stomach are very light and will probably go away enough to satisfy my ego.  I highly recommend giving the Mustela cream a chance
Get yourself a can of "photoblocker" and this license plate or risk being victimized by some deputy do-right and his shiny new toy: the traffic camera. Rumor has it that several class-action suits are underway while others have been won against these cameras. I lost $180 in tickets to the fiefdom of Chicago before installing this system. The tinted lense covers your plate and protects you from losing your tag. My tag has been stolen once and weather took another during the past 4 years. The solution I chose was a couple of coats of photoblocker with the smoke cover lense over the top; I tried to get a polarizing sheet from 3M but they would not sell it to me because most states are making these defenses illegal. The principle of operation is simple: the photoblocker reflects back the light from the camera flash, the smoky lense deadens some of that reflection but obscures it (like a polarizing sheet)making it even harder to read than with the photoblocker alone. Also, by itself, the lense will make it a little harder to see your numbers in daylight. By law, your numbers must be visible but there is no scientific minimum so anything you can do to inconvenience the cops will benefit you.  ---  --- FYI: photoblocker works because the traffic cameras need the flash. It is all about shutter speed. To capture a clear picture of a moving object --obviously, you are racing through a stop sign-- you must have a flash. If you tried without the flash the shutter speed would be too slow to catch anything but a blur. By sending a pulse of reflected light you cause the photo to be over-exposed. One of the makers of the traffic camera says that all they have to do is re-develop the picture. Perhaps, but I seem to remember you would need to develop two pictures and put together the photos. This seems like a lot of trouble for a police department and may even require re-programming the software for their digital cameras. They probably won't bother: there are lot of people without counter-measures and the cameras costs them a fortune anyway. ---   ---  --- If this review was helpful, please add your vote -- Thanks
It is working well, little slow warm up. But actually I wanted a hot air brush, not this, because I have very short hair, but i was mistaken when i ordered hot brush instead of hot air brush
I'm not a big perfume girl.  I mean, I love the pretty bottles and tend to store up the really antique (or antique-y looking) ones.  But I generally prefer essential oils over perfume.  That said, out of the dozens that I own, I keep three on hand at all times.  (Four if you count the little mini I got from SpaceNK) ---  --- Santa Maria Novella for rubbing on my ankles. I know it's a bit mature but it reminds me of Italy.  And monks.   --- Chanel Mademoiselle because my mother always taught me to love Chanel and I just prefer that scent to the others.  --- And Marc Jacobs because, to be honest, if I had to choose the loveliest, this would be it.  It's lovely and light.  Not too over powering.  Affordable.  And gets tons of compliments.   ---  --- Also comes in cute bottle.  :
I was looking for a double stroller that I could get in and out of my sedan easily. I didn't like the tandems because they not only take up tons of space, but they are also very heavy. This stroller is light, and I can take it in and out of my trunk with one hand. Plus, because my kids are heavy enough to push, I am not pushing an extra 25+ pounds in stroller. Because it is side-by-side, it can be a tight fit going through some doors, but I have never been unable to get through a door.   ---  --- My husband thinks that some of the parts are cheap and look like they can break easily, but with 6 months of lots of use, we have had no problems. The sun visors have bent at an angle when storing, but I can still use them fine and I like that they rotate down, so you can angle them with the sun. I am so glad that I bought this rather than a larger, more expensive, heavier tandem stroller
Looks great, functions great.  Manual is a little daunting and a couple of the words on the display are very small.  I have 20/20 vision and I can't always read everything that is being displayed.  It is mostly in the Alt and Barometer functions where there is lots of info being shown.   ---  --- Highly recomended
I have an Almansa 435 Seniorita, which is a very lovely little classical guitar, so I have some idea what a decent classical guitar should sound like. I got this little one for my son, who is 5, and didnt want to spend much because you know how children can be when it comes to lessons and instruments. I was very surprised at the quality of the sound. It is still in it's breaking in period, so the strings are still stretching, but it sounds really, really, nice. I even played on it myself (you know, just to get it warmed up for my son!) and it truly is not bad. Doesnt sound "tinny" or "toyish". Sounds like a classical guitar. Now I bought a much more expensive one a few years ago for my daughter, who has since given up the guitar, and that was handmade in mexico, solid wood, 3/4 size, and didn't sound nearly as good as this little thing. For this price, you get a solid spruce top, the finish is nice, kind of matted, the tuners are pretty good, and so far the strings aren't too bad. The base strings look like they could be silver-plated. Unfortunately you dont get any product information in the box so who knows where the strings came from and what kind they are (the guitar is romanian), but the main thing is that the guitar sounds so nice that a child will be encouraged to continue, the teacher will be pleased, and the parents will not have to suffer from more than the usual beginning-any-instrument "noises", and perhaps a lot less because it has such a pleasant sound.  Now of course it isnt comparable to the almansa or to finer guitars, but for a young child who is serious about wanting to study classical guitar, this is a very fine instrument at an EXCELLENT price. This model is sold on other sites for about 20 dollars more, but why pay that?! If you are looking for a small guitar for your young child, this one is a very good bet. A real, very decent sounding, classical guitar for the price of a toy one
I thoroughly enjoy this collection of hits from The Mamas and the Papas. Every song is fun and the tunes will stay with you long after you're done listening. ---  --- Like other selections from the 20th Century Masters series, this can't be called a complete collection. However, what is included is fantastic and I find myself popping it into my CD player much more often than many other CDs. ---  --- My copy of this CD (which I bought new) includes an 8-page folder with two photos of the band (besides the cover photo), a short band biography written by Joseph F. Laredo, and a track listing with song writing and original release credits. Song lyrics are not included. The jewel case is fully transparent with another photo of the band on the inside of the back paper. ---  --- As a side note, if you are a fan of the ABC television series "Lost" this CD includes the Mama Cass song "Make Your Own Kind Of Music" that is featured on Desmond's record player in the hatch. ---  --- If you're just starting with The Mamas and the Papas, or simply want a brief overview of some of their better known songs, this is a great CD. ---  --- For more The Mamas and the Papas, check out Criterion's phenomenal DVD release of Monterey Pop (or the box set The Complete Monterey Pop Festival). This concert DVD is absolutely brilliant, and includes several songs from The Mamas and the Papas.
It would be easier to keep score on a book that is not glossy or bound; ink smears, pencil does not show up, and writing in the crease is difficult.  They should include a score book similar to the typical baseball scoring books; spiral bound, paper.  Other than that, the product is exactly what we were looking for. 
 ---  --- THE FIRST HALF ---   If they had made movies back then, in 1871, it would move as slowly as this. ---   Perhaps that date suits the film to perfection. --- The days of utter simplicity, with nearly nothing happening.  --- Where maybe days are filled with yourself. --- Not distractions. ---  ---   After half an hour, all I could think was, if this was on TV, not only would everybody switch off, the sh** (show) would be axed. ---   It may even beat so many foregin movies as THE SLOWEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME.  --- But slow really means empty. ---  --- THE OTHER HALF (OF ME) ---   Yet I have since come to learn, by others' reviews, this is a movie which YOU must make, by the mood, or the feeling of dread others speak of. Or else you are left with the feeling of dead. ---   I failed to do that, and without that, the film fails miserably I reckon. Perhaps because I am dead.  ---   So, therefore, I envy those creative creatures of subtle senses. Or whether it was because they were so simple, or easily pleased, which means more modest, more modern.  ---   So, as in real life, it's only the FEELING which makes anything real. ---  --- MY FIRST (OR WORST?) HALF ---   The other part of me thought that, the film being a feature length, they think they can just not try for half an hour, an hour. Such is the problem with many filmakers, even today. When, being a torture, err feature, they should try much harder!! ---    Therefore the atmosphere spoken of in these reviews can only be like saying there is smoke without fire. Virtually nothing happens, and what does makes little sense, as any unconcious creation. ---  --- MY BETTER HALF OF THE SCHIZOPHRENIC ---   But the acting of the lead lady is expressive and genuine, and not being stereotype; is pleasingly real. Weird as suits the role. As are the others natural, with no Hollywood posing. How often have I heard that story - good acting, bad film? Oh I'm sorry, I did it again. ---   The only thing exciting is the title. ---  --- THE WHOLE ---    My conclusion is: I DON'T KNOW WHICH IS MY BETTER HALF, AND WHICH IS MY WORST HALF . . . ? ---   So, all things being unequal, I choose both. I stand and fall by both my views. (I guess that's why God gave us 2 eyes.) ---  ---    I was going to give it only one star* at first, but now I give it merely two**, knowing I'm still mean. ---  I see this movie as perhaps the greatest measure of one's temperament. ---   If you feel better than me, are supernaturally sensitive, or have the patience of a saint to me, add one, two, or three more stars respectively. ---  ---   I intend to watch it again, and then maybe I can give a before and after shot. ---  ---   Please feel free to reject me, write negative comments about me, or scare me. Or kill me. ---  --- [The world's First Amazoning Interactive Review] That makes it fair
I should say up front that I have never played chess, nor do I understand the game. But I remember being intrigued about the film when I saw the theatrical trailer. Was I intrigued because of the fact that the film was about a young boy with a special gift of a game? Was it the intense images of competition? Was it a curiosity about the game of chess itself and how it was played? Or was it about a deeper struggle within the boy? The answer is all of the above. "Searching For Bobby Fischer" is an excellent family film for all. I am living proof that even those who don't know jack about chess will love this movie. It is a movie not just about chess, but about acceptance, the bond of love and friendship, compassion for others, and not being afraid to be who you want to be. The balance of drama with edge-of-your-seat competition makes this a truly remarkable film. ---  --- Max Pomeranc plays the young and sensitive Josh Waitzkin, a pint-sized seven-year old with a cute lisp, who becomes fascinated with the "lower class" men playing chess in a New York park. He watches the men, his eyes shifting with each move of the pieces. He convinces his mother to go to the park with him, where he plays a game of chess with an older gentleman. It is there that Josh's mother realizes her son has a knack for chess. Also noticing Josh is the fast-talking park chess player, Vinnie (a funny and great performance from Laurence Fishburne) who befriends the boy and eventually teaches him a thing or two about the game. After a match with Josh, Josh's father (played by Joe Mantegna) realizes his son's special gift and enlists the help of a stern but knowledgeable chess teacher named Bruce (played by Ben Kingsley) to make Josh an even better chess master. Bruce sees a young Bobby Fischer in Josh and cannot resist the temptation to take him under his wing and perhaps fill the void that Bobby Fischer left in the country after his mysterious disappearance. Through all the technical strategies of the game being learned, Josh and Bruce develop a good friendship and with Bruce's help, combined with his own special gift, Josh excels in chess tournaments and collects a shiny bundle of trophies. But there may be a test even harder than becoming a grand master of chess. ---  --- We've all heard of parents trying to live their dreams through their children, especially when a parent sees a special gift in their child. But what happens when the thrill of competition and the persistent need to win cloud the parents' mind too much? And what happens when a beloved teacher wants you to be a carbon copy of someone or something that you're not? These are tests that run way deeper for Josh Waitzkin than any chess tournament. Josh learns quickly how addictive competition is and how obsessed people can become with a certain game. In his own way, the insightful Josh shows his father and teacher that he is not one of these people who lives and breathes chess like Bobby Fischer did. In the process, Josh pushes his father and teacher's feelings about him and the game of chess to the brink where they find they have to rethink their feelings. It's a matter of what is more important: chess competition, or love? Through it all, the three of them find that they can tolerate losing at chess but cannot tolerate losing something more dear; love and friendship for each other no matter what. There are some truly touching scenes in the film from the lecture Josh receives from his dad in the pouring rain, to the visit from his teacher at the Chicago tournament which comes toward the end of the show. But amongst the competition and drama, there are some nice comic scenes from Vinnie's trash talking against the others in the park, to the scene where the all the parents are literally locked up away from their kids during a tournament because they are so obnoxious, to the humorous appearance by William H. Macy when he offers to get Josh's dad a tuna sandwich.  ---  --- The climax comes in the huge chess championship at the end of the film where Josh takes Bruce and Vinnie's teachings along with his own style of playing and faces off against another chess prodigy named Jonathan. Jonathan is a boy I feel sorry for in the film. Playing since he was four years old, all Jonathan knows is chess and goes about life with a glazed expressionless look on his face. Perhaps this boy is proof of what living for a game can do to you, especially when you cannot just be a kid. ---  --- The acting is terrific. Ben Kingsley, Max Pomeranc and Joe Mantegna give us a very touching and real performance in this film. It's too bad that Pomeranc did not act much since this film because he was a great little actor and very convincing. A nice touch to the movie is the real black and white film clips of a very young Bobby Fischer talking about and playing chess with Pomeranc narrating along. It gives us a bit of the history of the world's greatest chess player and also gives us the implication that people were searching for a new chess hero to fill the void when Bobby Fischer vanished; enter Josh Waitzkin. ---  --- "Searching For Bobby Fischer" is one of those stand-up-and-cheer films that is perfect fun for the whole family with some valuable lessons to be learned as well! This is a movie you'll want to watch time and time again.
In my experience really learning a language requires a mix of learning approaches. That means books, tapes, tutoring, and experience in a country that uses it. I have done all of these and feel this product is well worth including in the mix. I highly reccomend it. If you're serious you need to just pony up the money and use it.  
I fell in love with another genealogy software years ago and was not happy with any newer ones when support and updates stopped for my original version.  When Ancestry updated this year I decided I had to try a new software package again that was compatible with the cool things you can now do on Ancestry so purchased this version.  I was very pleasantly surprised and happy.  I am still learning the best way to do things and occsionally get frustrated correcting info I have entered incorrectly but I would certainly recommend it.  The online checking it does and ability to attach the records found online is pretty awesome
I wish I had read the Amazon reviews of this item before I paid $19 for it at an office supply store. It may seem a bit trivial, but the smell of this wrist pad was a deal breaker. It's unfortunate, too, because everything else about it is perfect: the color, the comfortable gel support and soft fabric, and the size (it runs the length of my Mac keyboard and provides support when I use my mouse). But the smell: a piercing, toxic smell that does not go away. It doesn't matter if I spend five minutes or five hours in front of my computer, I still smell the synthetic backing of the wrist pad, and it's made it impossible for me to work. I finally had to get rid of it
The sugar-free was very good. I've had the regular but these are really good too, especially if you are a diabetic or just want to avoid sugar. Quite a few flavors
A well-researched look at aviation that reminded me of the novels of Nevil Shute. --- My favorite chapter was Friday Norton QA 11:50am. A perfect description of the working methods of a certain veteran TV newsman who just retired at age 88. --- Of course there are plot holes. The heroine a single mom researching the cause of an air incident is in jeopardy from union thugs and has initially has guards. But as the jeopardy increases, the guards aren't there. No followup mention. What happened to them? --- Some vulgarity in language. --- But all in all, a great fun read.
Really does not get the film noir credit it deserves (probably from its title with the uninformed film watcher expecting this to be a feature starring Dinah Shore or other 1940's musical starlet.) Some very satisfying twists of the old plot make this memorable and high on the repeat viewings scale.  Gene Tierney is wonderfully mercurial - sometimes hot-hot-hot and other times just plain icy cold. This was her only Oscar nominated film and you can see why she was picked here.  See Gene in this and in "Laura" and you will see two of the best 1944 leading actress film perfomances
Arrived fast and in time for V-day! Thanks for your high quality product and its fast arrival
This deal was too good to be true. Of course I wasn't expecting any name brand stuff here, but at least I expected them to all work. I don't know if I got a bad earbud or what, but it adds static and noise and therefore cannot be used. ---  --- The case I didn't need, but it does fit well and looks to be decently constructed. The power adapter seems to work fine. So basically I spent $9.99 and am only using the power adapter. I guess that's a good enough deal. I think I'll go spend some extra money and get a brand name earbud/headset though
I am a retired attorney who has experimented with earlier versions of the Dragon software over the last eight to 10 years.  I was never quite satisfied with the performance of the product.  However, I now own version 9 and have found it to be a very useful and accurate product.  If I were still practicing law, I would unquestionably utilize a program like this in my practice.  Because I did not like being tied to my computer by a microphone cable, I purchased a wireless microphone (by Nady - which I have also reviewed) which works even better than the wired headset that came with the program.  The program required less than one-half hour of setup although I have continued to train the program to meet the needs of my particular voice patterns.  This dictation is much more accurate than my typing, and I have found that correcting errors is a fairly simple process as well.  My only regret is that I purchased the basic program, rather than an advanced program.  Now that I see how well the product works, I wish that I had a more specialized vocabulary and the ability to dictate in more than just English as I am fluent in Spanish and have a growing acquaintance with French.  Incidentally, I dictated this review and use the dictation program regularly to respond to and send e-mails, as well as dictate letters, memoranda and outlines in Microsoft word.  It may be relevant to note that I am not using an underpowered computer system.  I have an AMD dual core system with 2 MB of RAM.  I am certain that there is a combination of good programming and growing computer power that makes a program such as this functional
Not only is the physical appearance of this model ugly, it is a complete downgrade. Panasonic takes off one of the most important features on the PV GS320 model,a MICROPHONE JACK! I currently own a 300 model and needed another camera to shoot different angels at the same time, since the 300 is discontinued I purchased the so called upgraded model. Now the only available model with MIC jack is the VDR 310, and I have heard DVD is quality on Camcorders is not what it should be. If you do any video prodcution and need to hook up your camera to a MIC, this camera is not for you
I am proud of the fact that I hold two degrees like many women. Do I work? No. I have chosen a different path. I have no children, married later in life, and gave up a wonderful job of two decades to care for my ill husband. Do I feel that I have no confidence nor respect? No. --- And from whom or what is this respect supposed to come from?   --- Caring for your family has nothing to do with any of this. I admire women who stay home to care for their families. When you have love, who gives a hoot what anyone else thinks. Personally, I find this book a little depressing, and I won't read it
Since I received this book I have been carting it around, using it for reference ever since. I wish that I had been introduced to this book sooner in my college career; it sets a good foundation for the basics. It is also good for sparking ideas if you are stuck. Robin Williams also writes well, making it a fun, easy read (like all her books). ---  --- I highly recommend this title
I saw this several times as a kid and it always stuck in my head.  It's a beautiful English production that has a definite melancholy, bittersweet flavor that's missing from other adaptations.  Really worth seeing.  It is a kid-friendly version?  Not really but smart teens may enjoy it.  Great performances from Ralph Richardson, Peter Sellers and Fiona Fullerton as Alice
Are we all talking about the same phone here? I haven't had any problems with it and using it is a breaze. I bought this phone after I wanted to change my calling plan so I wouldn't get stuck with roaming charges while I was away, far from my calling area. My old phone (also an LG) wasn't compatible with this new calling plan because it was embedded with the old AT&T service. I love the fact that I can download MP3 ringtones to this phone because that was one thing that I was looking for. I also like the fact that it has a speakerphone. It does not have a camera, and I was not looking for one. I already own three very good stand alone cameras, why bother with another?? I was although a little aggravated having to re-enter all of my old phone book information because that's the only way you can do it. The manual is not hard to read at all unless you are dyslexic.
This jacket is extremely poorly made.  I have it in black, but I should say black and white, because there is so much white from the feathers peeking through
I'm very pleased with this Laser Garage Park. --- This Laser Garage Park was easy to install and works really well. I would recommend this to any one looking for a practical --- way to avoid damage to their car while trying to park in the --- garage.
Recently got my SleepMate and it is very effective.  Somehow it blocks out most sounds outside of my bedroom, and I don't have any trouble sleeping.  I use to wake up at least 2-3 times a night, and have the hardest time getting back to sleep.  I hardly ever wake up at all now. ---  --- Great product, and I'd definately recommend it to anyone in need of a good night's sleep
My nephew who is 3 years old got My First LeapPad not to long ago and he loves it. He loves train so he got one that is Thomas the train and he playes it the morning when he get up and at night before he goes to sleep. There are many different types, and they are everywhere you just have to know where to look. For instance [...] Over all I think this is an amazing learning toy for toddler and young kids who look forward to reading and writting.
I love Cheetos! ---  --- Did you have any idea you could review Cheetos on Amazon.com?  I admit I had no idea.  I typed it as a goof and up the page came. --- But I stand by my 5 star review. ---  --- Full of yummy MSG.  Do you know how MSG works?  It dilates your taste buds so all the flavors seem more intense.  It actually has no taste of its own.  Did you know? ---  --- When my mother was pregnant with me, she would wake up in the middle of the night and ask my father to go out and buy cheetos.  I don't know why.  Maybe the salty goodness. ---  --- If cheetos cost as much as truffles, they would be a considered a delicacy and served at the finest restaurants.  I wonder if you can buy truffles on Amazon.com.  Shall we check?  See you there
My almost 5 year old daughter loves this toy.  It is easy for her to control.  My 8 year old thinks it is boring.   --- I don't think it has any educational value. --- The controller has a long pointed antenna with a plastic rounded end, so the kids have to be careful not to poke each other with it.
i've got really sensitive feet and i get blisters really easily, sometimes within 5mins of wearing a new pair of shoes. my quest for the comfortable ballet flat has ended here, after months of searching! the heel is nice and soft but there's still sufficient support here (for me that is. for those of you out there with back problems, it might not be sufficient). i got them in the gold, which is a gorgeous pale lame, and am currently lusting over the black :
We looked at many TV stands to go with the Sony TV we were buying.  Only a few were worth considering, but finally decided to go with the Sony unit designed for our specific TV.  Am I glad we did!  It has hold downs to secure the TV and the cable straps at the rear are easy to use and make the installation clean and clear.  Very nicely designed, along with being good looking
i purchused this for my daughter with vision then my vision impaired daughter used it while she was at home she loved it, so now i'm buying her one for her new ap
A very basic phone with not one good ringtone, display or wallpaper.  Did not recieve the USB cable. I am going back to the Nokia 6102i. 
From using only two cordless controllers; this one and the XBox 360's controller, I like this one a LOT more. It's comfortable, small enough to not be too big, and just the right weight as to not be too light. I couldn't ask for a better controller- unless Logitech made the wired controller with the leather handles into a wireless one, then I'd find myself that much more pleased :) Buy this one, there isn't a better wireless controller out there
Just wanted to answer Reviewer:"homedecaramel" and his question as to who Melissa refers to from the song titled' "Melissa's Garden". ---  --- Melissa was the daughter of close friends of Steve Vai. --- She passed away 5 years ago at a fairly young age due to ovarian cancer.  Melissa's parents built a beautiful garden as a remembrance of her.  Melissa had a wonderful spirit and her spirit lives on as is apparent in Steve's beautiful tribute and in Melissa's Garden. ---  ---  ---  ---   
When Pokemon first debuted, I thought it would rock, and Misty, Brock, and Ash would stay together as a gang forever, and Ash would love it to just be walking around the world, earning badges, etc., and that's the way it would stay. Maybe even Ash and MIsty would fall in love! But, nope. The dudes who are creating these movies are sucking kids in with exclusive Pokemon cards, and the animation is just getting cheaper. This movie is totally different from the original movies and the TV series, and it sucks. I'll hold on to the older series and DVD's, but, nowadays, Brock and Misty are gone, and it's just boring without them. For those who agree with me, get the message out there that Pokemon is going down the tubes and it stinks. Bring back Brock and Misty!!! IT WILL SAVE THE SERIES! Oh, and I'm only giving this movie two stars because they went so far as to make a movie about something so ridiculous, with so much change, and so little things the same. :-( Boo
My sister who has 4 kids insisted I buy this and boy was she right!  Those of you who say it takes time to snap it on and off aren't thinking about what you have to do to change the crib sheet.  First of all, the bumper has to be removed just to get to the mattress in any reasonable fashion and that's a pain to tie on and off.  Especially when you get it on there just right.  Then you have to lift up the mattress to get to the sheet bottom and pull it over the corners.  Did I mention that moving the mattress causes that cute little dust ruffle to get out of poistion?  Ugh, I don't think so. ---  --- I'd much rather deal with a few straps and snaps then have  my daughter sit on a soaking sheet (this pad wicks away the moisutre) and have to go through so much trouble to change it. ---  --- As far as the "imprint" on her face, I haven't noticed any and she hasn't been bothered
I was very disappointed when I received this to see that it was simply a package of two cables.  Cables that you can pick up at Radio Shack for MUCH cheaper.  Just ridiculous.  The Airport Express itself is fantastic, but skip this accessory and go to your local Radio Shack for the mini-RCA cable, and a quick search online for the optical to mini
I made mistake getting such a big & bulky case for small MiniDV Sony camcorder HC26. This case can take any big size old camcorders (like old Sony Hi8), so if you are looking for your new camcorder this definately is a bad choice
i only had product for 10 days and it stopped working correctly, i opened up the unit to discover a circuit board had been hod poged on to the main board and it soldered connections had broken, i would not advise the purchase of this item, it is poory put to gether on the insid
This little scraper will get your grill cleaner than just soaking it in the sink.  It scrubs all the excess off with ease and leaves even the dirtiest grill clean.  Sturdier than any other brush I or my family has used.  The one we have now has lasted quite a long time.  It cleans each rail on the grate beautifully.   ---  --- The wood on the handle will become dirty so keep it clean
i was hoping for a little bit higher quality, but you get what you pay for i gues
I was watching Cinemax one night, bored out of my mind and unable to sleep, when this movie came on.  The acting made me laugh.  The premise made me laugh.  Everything about it made me laugh.  Hey, at least it was fun to make fun of anyway.  Just kinda mad that I wasted a good 80 minutes on this piece of crap
I bought two of these (one for each daughter 3 & 6).  It is very hard to find sterling chains in the length needed for children. Thank you
It wasn't the easiest thing to transfer photos from a computer and to delete the "samples" on the frame was no picnic either, but once learned it becomes easier. ---  --- I went from frustrated to happy, soon enough
A great great novel! Catches you from the beginning and doesn't let go. You become obsessed and engrossed. Collins has the most gorgeous way of writing....drawing you in. And his descriptive ability is astounding
I've tried lots of coffee pods, and Black Mountain Gold is by far THE BEST!! The flavor is always full and rich, never bitter. The Moka Java is delicious.  
This keychain is very cute and great if your'e friends want to try it becuase it is cheap, so they can buy it for themselves.  I have the Pixie flavor, and it is great. But, it fell off my purse once, so that's why I am not giving this item five stars. If they made the keychain a little stronger, I would definetly give it a five
I bought the datapilot universal pro kit recently and it worked great! My screen broke on my nokia 6102, and i ended up buying a razor. I had some really important numbers on that phone and this program really saved me. Transferred all my numbers from my broken one into my new razor in a couple of minutes. Also, the image editor and the ringtone thingy came in very useful for saving images and sending mp3s to my phone.
I bought this identical bed at Toys R Us for $175.00. This person is ripping people off, do your shopping before paying their mark up and shipping costs
Boyz N the Hood is an oustanding movie about a young man named Tre Styles who grows up on the hostile and violent streets of South Central Los Angeles. After a confrontation with a classmate at his school, Tre's mother forces him to go and live with his father Furious. She says, " The last thing I want is to see you end up a drunk hanging out in front of one of these liquor stores or killed. Look at me, I'm serious. I love you. You're my only son." She just can't take his problems anymore. ---  --- After being dropped off at his fathers place, Tre grows through  5 more years of seeing what hood life is really like making him about 13 years old. All the while Furious tells Tre, "You know Tre you may think I'm being hard on you right now, but I'm not. What I'm doing is trying to teach you how to be responsible. Its like your little friends across the street, they don't have anybody to show them how to do that. And you're gonna see how they end up too."  ---  --- His next door neighbors Chris, Doughboy, and Ricky are very close and all grow up together learning how to survive the streets. Ricky is a high school all star football player and scholar who hopes to get into USC on a scholarship. Meanwhile his brother doughboy on the otherhand becomes a thug involved with a gang (the crips), pushing drugs, boozing 40s (OE), and running his mouth.  ---  --- Ricky and Tre both want to make something of their future while doughboy is just trying to survive. One night at the strip on Crenshaw, a group of bloods are strolling through, and one of them bumps into Ricky on purpose trying to start crap. He says, "F*** you lookin at nigga?" Ricky shouts back, "I'm still trying to find out nigga!" Doughboy hears the confrontation taking place, rushes up with his homeboys right by his side and says "We got a problem here? We got a problem? He pulls aside his coat flashing a .45 concealed in his pants and flashes gang signs. ---  --- The bloods flash gang signs back. Doughboy pulls back the slide on his gat (cocking it). The gangsters give him a dirty look, turn their backs and walk away. Right when the crowds are ready to leave, the bloods open the trunk of their tricked out hyundai and fire a fully automatic uzi in the air. Ricky and Tre drive off together saying, "can't go nowhere without getting all shot up and crap." They get pulled over and hassled by the cops. Tre drives over to his girlfriends house and he shows sad and angry emotions. She comforts him and they end up making love. ---   --- About 15-20 minutes near the end of the movie, Rickys wife asks him to go the the convenience store to get some cornmeal. He walks a few blocks from his house with tre and walks out of the store with the cornmeal, a container of milk, and several lottery tickets. Ricky and Tre are walking back home and Ricky is totally unaware that his SAT scores for college are waiting for him when he gets home. He scored just enough to get him accepted into USC. The red hyundai pulls up on a side street and the bloods inside are saying, "Theres that bastard that was talking smack the other night." The gangsters grab their guns and the car peels out around the corner catching Ricky and Tre running and ducking into an alley near a wooden fence down the street. The fellas inside the car are shouting, "Cut him off man. Lets kill him. Come on man, go." The leader of the gang steps on the gas and the car races down the street after them. Doughboy and his homies are waiting on the porch chilling when the red car races past with its system booming. ---  --- Doughboy knows something is up and he races inside, grabs his gat, and the guys jump into the car, racing to find Ricky & Tre. Ricky and Tre are walking down the alley. Ricky is finishing scratching off his lottery ticket when the car full of bloods pulls up. Tre shouts, "RICKY!" Ricky sees the car, drops his bag, and runs as fast as he can away from the car. By that time it is too late. A 12 gauge shotgun gets raised and blasts two shots. The first one hits him in the legs to cripple him and the 2nd shot hits him blowing a hole in his chest, knocking him to the ground. ---   --- There is so much blood all over. Tre tries to comfort him Ricky and keep him concious as Doughboys car pulls up. Ricky dies in Tres arms and they take him home. Rickys mother comes unglued and the mom thinks that Doughboy is the one who shot him. She starts beating on him like crazy. Tre pulls him away from her on the porch. Tres clothes are covered from head to toe in blood and he tells Doughboy "meet me at my house in 5 minutes." Tres girlfriend tries to stop him to see whats up and he tells her to go home. Tre walks into his fathers bedroom and loads a .357 magnum. He wants to kill the guys responsible for murdering his best friend right in front of him. ---  --- Furious does his best to stop Tre from commiting murder by confronting him in the living room and demands him to hand the gun over. Tre falls into his dads arms and begins sobbing. His dad says, "Your my only son and I'm not gonna lose you to any crap. I love you man. Go clean yourself up. Go on." Tre goes back to his bedroom knowing that his buddies are outside waiting for him in the car. He jumps out the window and runs to the car jumping in the back of the car. They race off and his father and buddy Chris are thinking, "oh shoot." Tres father is very nervous because he knows what the guys plan to do after the tragic & bloody afternoon. Tre does a lot of thinking in the backseat and orders his friends to pull over the car and let him out. They do as he wants. The guys in the car let him out and they drive off into the night looking for the thugs who murdered his friend. They pull into a burger joint and find the gangsters outside eating burgers at a table. They load & cock a fully automatic AK-47, turn off the lights on the car, and pull a drive by shooting on every single person at the table. The car comes to a screeching halt, doughboy cocks his sidearm and runs up to the surviving gangsters and murders every single one of them in cold blood.  ---  --- They peel out of the parking lot and the following morning Tre ends up talking to Tre about how hard it is to break the cycle of violence growing up in the hood. Doughboy says, "They sure pushed the clock on Rick man. I ain't got no brother. Next thing you know somebody might try to smoke me. Don't matter though. We all gotta go sometime huh?" Tre tries to comfort him by saying, "Hey dough. You still got one brother left man." Doughboy says, "Thanks man." Doughboy and Tre embrace with a hug. Doughboy walks away pouring out his bottle of OE as an homage to his mudered brother and then a message comes up on the screen saying "2 weeks later doughboy is murdered." How sad. Personally I didn't like the ending. It wants to get out the message that the violence never seems to stop. Tre & his girl survive and go to college out of state later in the fall. A very powerful and moving story that should be shown to every young man & woman near high school age. Although the movie has a lot of language and is very violent, it has an important message that needs to get across to everyone. ---  --- "INCREASE THE PEACE
I've had previous subscriptions to this magazine and I have to say that its most entertaining in many respects.  The fiction keeps you reading, guy's first times are always interesting, the interviews are informative...oh, and then there's the hot guys (all perfectly legal) showing all their worth.  A great mag for anyone that can appreciate the beauty that is the young man
I bought the cream hoping to get rid of, or at least lighten stretch marks from pregnancy.  I have used it three times a day for 3 months and have seen no results.  It smells horrible and having to apply 3 times a day is really a pain in the hind parts.  I was very optimistic after reading some of the other reviews.  I'm now very disappointed.  If something sounds too good to be true, it is
C. Howard Company has been around since 1934, when Mr. Howard formed it in New York City to sell his violet mints. Actually, due to the quirky way he wrote his signs, it has been "Choward Violet Mints" ever since then! ---  --- Violets are very hard to describe. They have a wonderful, perfumed scent that makes you think that they will taste like some sort of chemical, but nothing can be further from the truth. These candies have a delicate taste that clears the mouth and freshens the breath. ---  --- When I was young, a local drug store carried a wide range of candies, including Violets (at least that's what I called them). Whenever I could I would go and buy a pack, and to this day the taste of Violets takes me back to my youth and that drug store with the giant racks of candy. ---  --- So, if you want a candy that tastes like NOTHING you've ever had before, then buy these candies. They are fantastic
I agree with the comments posted here.  Like most of us, I was interested in the Bose sound yet put off by the prestige price.  Even on E-Bay the going price ended up being around $400 -- for a used older model.  So I did some research and stumbled upon a nice comparison-shopper article that put the Bose up against several competitors, including this high-end TEAC.  I have to say that I'm entirely satisfied. ---  --- The chrome retro look is quite appealing, and the model has a couple of features that, for me, beat out Bose entirely.  I wanted a top-loading door like the old Bose models but also the ability to play MP3 like the new ones, and this gave me both.  The sound and punch is remarkable.  At flat setting, it is a bit bassy, that's true, but you get a -5 to+ 5 range for both bass and treble adjustment: I set mine at -3 and +1 respectively and am very happy with the sound in my bedroom.  Input and alarm functions are limited but not problematic.  10 presets can be cycled though quickly enough, and just remember to set it to a station (or load a CD) that you'd want to be woken up to before calling it a night! ---  --- TEAC customer service I can't comment on, but I bought a reconditioned unit from an Amazon seller for less than $100, including shipping.  A sweet deal for a sweet machine.
Do you know how clever Alan Trachtenberg is?  I mean, do you really, really know?! Because if not, this book is for you.  Trachtenberg's book is only superficially about Indians or Americans, it is about the obscure conections he can draw between unrelated things--because he is very clever, you know. In so far as this book has a thesis, that it is it
This isn't much like the spiderman games that i'm used to, but it is definitely a lot of fun. Good storyline for a fighting game. The single player is challenging (but beatable) and uses most if not all the characters. There are plenty of characters, and most are different and have unique powers. There are two versus modes: against the computer or against a friend. The computer is pretty easy to beat. Each character has it's own pros and cons. Another thing i like is that the character levels aren't the same (anybody remember super smash bros?). In most games there are a lot of different people but they're mostly the same and your winning mostly just rides on your experience with their moves. In this there are some major strong characters unlocked at the end.  --- I actually got bored and a little dissappointed after playing this a couple of days, but a little while ago i started playing again and it is awesome. recommended for comic book fans
Style : Salsa exercise --- Level : Very fit ---  --- This is now the best latin exercise dvd on the market. It is a Salsa style exercise dvd. It contains pure NY shines with some salsa rhythm inspired dance steps. It is a much better routine than her first dvd which was geared towards the beginner market. This dvd is made more for the serious Salsa dancer who is already fit. ---  --- For people looking for a salsa shine video this would be a great start. ---  --- I must point out you would have to be fit to do this dvd. It is very fast paced. ---  --- Buy Lisa's first dvd to prepare yourself for this dvd
After having purchased a 3 burner Kenmore grill about 5 years ago and on my second replacement set of burners, I decided it was time to invest in a "quality" gas grill. When I looked at the Webers 5+ years ago, they were quite pricey and not knowing much about grills I said heck no! Well, live and learn. After replacing burners twice at around $70 each time and the Kenmore flavorizer bars at $40 all in 5 years, I decided to bite the bullet and spend the cash. After lots of research on lots of websites I went with the Gold B. So far it's been great. Warranty and quality is a lot better then the Kenmore and it should last a lot longer. My friend has had his Siver C for 9 years and it's still going strong! Delivery was quick! I ordered on a Monday and it was delivered on Friday. Setup was easy. Grill heats up very hot and quickly even though it's only 36000 BTU'S. I just ordered the rotisserie attachment for it and I'll provide feedback as soon as I try it out. This grill is now discontinued from Weber as they have new models out now. I got this on sale at Amazon for $466.00 on sale. I wouldn't pay anymore than that. Look for a closeout deal on here or elsewhere. I'm sure they will start popping up.
I was very happy with the previous model DSC-N1, which took very nice pictures just with pointing and shooting. But this one, while I only had chance to use it indoors and outdoor in raining weather, it really disappointed me. The pictures are always blured due to too much exposure, I used auto flash, for which the camera should takes nice pictures as it  is a point and shoot camera and it is 10.1MP!  ---  --- I'm going to try more when the weather gets better but most possible I will return it, I just can't accept the quality of the indoor pictures it takes. I doubt I was unlucky and got a bad one, I can't believe a 10.1MP sony camera takes so poor pictures. And after reading the previous review about the terrible Sony custmer servce, I decide I will avoid Sony customer service, and the camera will just be returned.   ---  --- Note: Found the review by Cecelia Choy "cece" on March 13, 2007 mentioned the same problem I had. I didn't have this problem with my previous model DSC-N1.  ---  --- April 17, 2006: I bought a new one and it takes nice pictures now! Suggestion for those having the same problem I had before -- exchange for another one!!
Philosophy products have really changed my skin, and I know this is true because the times I have run out of Philosophy products and replaced them with even very expensive department store brands, my skin starts breaking out and looking blotchy, uneven and tired.  Then I remember how much Philosophy does for me, and I absolutely have to reorder.  If you buff your face with the microdelivery peel, wash thoroughly with "Purity Cleanser", then follow with this product, "When Hope Is Not Enough Serum" then "Hope in a Jar" moisturizer on your entire face and neck, your skin will just glow, and you will be amazed how fast blemishes and blotches just go away and don't come back!  After using the microdelivery peel, my skin looks 75% better right away.  After a week of using all the products, my skin is clear and glowing.  I really believe in these products.  They feel great, smell great and work great
I purchased this car for my 2 year old son for Christmas.  Shame on me for not taking it out of the box and testing it out prior to Christmas morning.  The car lights up and makes sounds (very annoying) but didn't move an inch.  I replaced all batteries - still no movement.  The manufacturer was of no help.  Thank god someone else also got him the Chicco remote control car - because it works! ---  --- Steer clear of this stinker
I wish that Amazon can get it right, that when you create a service you do  not have to go into some's computer and screw around, Shame on you Amazon for allowing this to happen. I guess I will have to purchase an Apple Ipod and go with I tunes. It appears to be a much better product and service
I had first bought the "Here and Now" hoping to hear the original recordings, but was slightly disappointed that on that CD the older songs were live performances only. If you want their hits as you remember hearing them on the radio or your old album that may be trashed, this is the CD for you
This is not your tipical music mag with all the coorporate mainstream bull.  This mag turns you on to what is up and coming in the music world and is a great tool for finding new music.  I recomend it to everyone that enjoys good music
"Discipleship Journal" does what many other Christian magazines do not do. It provides instruction, and challenges the reader to be directly and fully engaged in a Christ-focused faith. While others may talk about Christianity, DJ asks you to pursue Christ through responding to Scripture. ---  --- This isn't an evangelistic magazine, like "Decision," or an encouraging magazine, per se, like "Moody." It is for the Christian looking to grow in his or her faith by examining themselves and what God's word says. ---  --- It is not for the passive pew sitter. This for the Christian who wants his or her faith to impact the days between Sundays. ---  --- There is nothing watered-down here. It is published by NavPress, who, like their counterparts, the college ministry Navigators, know the crucial necessity of biblical study by the everyday Christian. Whether it is a discussion about Satan's favorite lies, how to study a particular book of the Bible, or an explanation of what prayer is an is not, DJ is the sort of publication that will cause you to pause mid-page and realize something new about our Lord and his ways. ---  --- This is a great tool for two or three people to use together. Even a small group... to go through the articles, week by week and discuss them and what this means in real life. I've even heard of CCD and Sunday school classes asking everyone to read selections from a certain issue as fodder for the next week's class. ---  --- I fully recommend "Discipleship Journal." Expect your faith to grow. ---  --- Anthony Trendl  --- editor, HungarianBookstore.co
The machine does fine for quick cleaning of your cd's/dvd's.  I can't give a complete review of the product because I only tried to repair 1 dvd... and it did not repair it
I am not much of a photographer. I found this camera easy to use and my pix are just great. Believe me, it's the camera.  The stabilizer thing works to give clear focus almost every time. I can even put the pix up on the computer and send them easily.  I'm thrilled. You do need to upgrade to a 1 mgb. memory card when you buy the camera.
A great and economical replacement! This product saved me a lot of money. The red in the color leaked a tiny bit in shipment but cleaned up and worked with no problem
I don't even own this CD, and after seeing the reviews I don't want it.  90% of the "5 star" reviews are people with ONLY ONE review.  Suspicious?? Look for yourself, it's right there to see.  I have some other meditation CDs that are very repetitive, I'm not going to make the same mistake here, especially with such SHAMELESS self-promotion
This item was promised to me as a free bonus for my purchase of Casio Exilim camera, but was never delivered. Now Amazon wants me to review it, so here your are..
Tony Kern has managed to pull together the wisdom and experience of  "the best" pilots around. His use of case studies of real pilots  and real situations includes examples from the military, commercial, and  geneal aviation communities. In short, the book is useful for any pilot  whether they are working toward their private pilot license or are employed  as a senior airline captain. For many pilots, it will reinforce what they  already know and practice but for many, it will provide the opportunity to  become "old" pilots.  If you fly, read the book
A friend gave this to me for my 6 month old daughter - the walker itself is wonderful, but the light and sound feature is just the worst - as others have said, it dies after about 2 months, and the battery is non-replacable. My daughter loved the sounds and now they just die and warble and I can't stand it! If you buy it, don't get it for the music/lights - they will let you down
I just received the latest issue of The Green Guide, titled 12 Top Products, and it's a great issue.  Lots of good shopping info
Oh how I love the Cucumis melo reticulatus!  It's much sweeter and tastier than the Cucumis melo cantalupensis (the European cantaloupe).  You see, the CMR is the American version, this very same cantaloupe that's produced in California.  This should be called the Freedom Musk-Melon...true patriots eat the CMR!  If you're some sort of brie eating French lover, then go for the CMC....you America-hating hippy
Good music but a bad title!  Elvis has left the Planet but a new King has been born with the self proclaimed new King of Rock and Roll Ken Rondell at http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/bigra
For flavor, I could give these cookies a "5", but the health aspects demand that they only rate a "4".  All told, they taste great and are the best on the go lunch I have found for hubby (he often eats on the run).  The price is right and it keeps him from cruising though the nearest drive though
What a terrible upgrade.  I'm going to uninstall it and go back to 6.  Even though I specifically told it to leave my file associations alone, it changed every one of them.  It's a nightmare.  I'm still trying to get Nero disassociated with certain file types, to no avail.  The backup program is awful, slow and much more difficult to use than the one built into 6.  Overall, Ultra 6 is a much better product.  I'm going to uninstall 7 and send it back to Nero with instructions on where they can associate it
There are buttered-up popcorn movies that entertain you, score a ticket to "Jurassic Park" and Spielberg for that, and there are films with gravitas, that move you, disturb you, drag you to the altar kicking and screaming, to consider circumstances you might not brave yourself.."Badlands," Terrence Malick's 1973 directorial debut, an overlooked jewel of a film, forcibly moves you, and takes an unsavory subject, the Charles Starkweather serial killings' crime spree, up in the vacated Badlands of South Dakota, and refines it til you posit, "How did we get here as a country? What went wrong?"..And then you appraise the challenges a film-maker overcomes to project the psychopathic wrath of two teenagers (Martin Sheen as Kit Carruthers, Sissy Spacek as Holly Sargis) on a thrill-killing "honeymoon", onto the silver screen and make it empathetic, palatable..Why would anyone care in the first place about two low-life, lost highway delinquents, who shoot a parent, assume they can get away consequence-free, and move on with their careless lives like nothing more infractious than cutting an afternoon civics class has occurred?..However, "Badlands" is rooted in unfortunate fact, these inexplicable events happened to a pedestrian populace in North America, and Malick lets you tag along in this teenage angst riddled odyssey, deeper and deadlier into an American wasteland..The film is palpable evil genuis, arguably a top ten American film classic, irrespective it was shot by a first time director, with an unknown cast.."Badlands" resonates with gritty authenticity, cinematic style, fierce inhumanity, and the most haunting musical score (Erik Satie's Gymnopedies 3) that underwrites a Sissy Spacek voice over narration, spoken in a lazy monotone like a detached schoolgirl explaining away her unexcused absence in the principal's office, when in fact Holly (Sissy Spacek) is the fractured other half of the Kit Carruthers' killing machine, a bossom buddy in crime..Some films are purposefully pure entertainment, escapist faire.."Badlands" on the other hand is rare art, belongs in a museum
My son is 5 years old and absolutly loves this digger.It was easy to put togther and is very durable.I would highly recommend it. He also likes that it has tracks so he can sit on it and move it where he wants
I use to Love Maxtor. Still Have one from 1999. so got this box hoping it would be a flexible way to go between two computers. Well, The darn thing crapped out within two months and all the data was gone. I did have a lot of it backed up but still, what a pain. Now that Seagate owns them, spend a few bucks more and get a seagate drive. OR get a couple of these and RAID them. but sending the thing back to get it exchanged is a pain and you are out over 30 bucks in shipping
Great service quick shipping, if you order through the companies web site you will save $10.0
Well, it was good.  I enjoyed it, but it was not the best plot and the characters had 2-D personalitys.. The worst thing, though, was how abruptly it ended. Other than that it had that great Japanese animation, and it was pretty fun to watch
I love Splenda and I love getting it in a big bag.  As a good ole Oklahoma girl, I live for my iced tea.  And my tea MUST be sweet, but sugar isn't an option.  So SPLENDA to the rescue.  We use it in everything and are learning new ways to use it every day because my Daddy has developed diabetes.  The big bags are often out at our local grocery store, so finding them at Amazon with our Amazon PRIME takes care of that problem
This thing is lots of fun. I like driving through the crowded parts of down town Atlanta and putting the loudspeaker on the sound of the frog croaking. Also, I like rolling up on crack heads and flipping on the police siren for a second.....that's funny.  --- The bad thing is that the wiring is not very long to connect the speaker to the box, so you are limited to where you can install the thing
One star is the lowest rating I can give this system and it's frankly not worth even that. Problems start with the design. You have to take out eight tiny little screws to insert the backup batteries or plug in a sensor cable into the nifty looking "solar powered" sender unit, which has to be placed somewhere in full sunlight for it to function at all. Once you've mounted the unit on your roof, you have to remove those pesky little screws on the roof, in the freezing wind usually, several times a winter. Or wait for Spring and nice weather when you don't need to know if you can expect black ice on your early morning drive to work.  --- Sometimes resetting the base station works (which you have to place inconveniently so that the unit has direct line of sight communication. Usually not. OS Sales has it advertised at 300 feet, but actually something less than forty if your batteries are more than a day old (see battery change procedure above). By the way, there is a backup nicad battery in the unit, supposedly kept charged by the impressive solar power collector. This will fail because it rapidly loses capacity due to a poor discharge recharge cycle. If any of these three fail, the unit won't function.  --- Strangely enough, my rain gauge (I live in the desert) has continued to function for over a year with little attention. However, the temp/humidity sensor which I would like to refer to most often, is what fails every night. I'd like to replace the Nicad battery, but can't find one anywhere.  --- Ahem. Customer Service and the lack of it. I don't know how many emails I've sent. Or calls I've placed. Or time I've spent listening to the backside of the Oregon Scientific hold button. Their website only lists complete systems in the replacement parts category. While assumptions can be dangerous, my only option seems to be to scrap $300 worth of two-year old hardware and buy more, and more, and more.  --- This was a well-intended gift. I'm trying to make it work. but it doesn't, usually when I need it most.
I have been looking for the perfect diaper bag and this is it!!  The description doesn't do the bag justice as it has many features not shown in any of the photographs.  To start there is a large back pocket to put all of your changing needs, which is quick and easy to access.  The heart of the bag contains ample room with six pockets total; two elastic pockets on one side and 4 layered pockets on the other.  There is also a front flap with a magnetic closure with one zippered pocket on the outside and a wallet organizer on the inside...the perfect area for mom's stuff.  There is a cell phone compartment on the front of the bag and a bottle pocket on each side of the bag.  The construction and material are very sturdy and everything closes up nicely so there is no risk of spilliage.  Finally, the graphite and green is very unisex, where many diaper bags are not so father friendly.  I am so pleased with this bag and the price is unbeatable!   
This is a durable and quality product. My son uses it for everything, from turning the lights on to getting on the potty. I use it to reach the pantry and get to all the permanent markers that I must hide from my 2 and a half year old. I must say that I am a hard core fan on Baby Bjorn items as they are durable, classic in design and color. This is a sturdy non-slip item It has supported me for months 120lbs (give or take 10 lbs!) We used it so much that I bought another step stool, made by playskool and I wished I had bought another BabyBjorn
This product is excellent!  Very sturdy, durable and the videos are challenging but doable - from beginner to advanced you will get the results you're after.  I highly recommend this product
I greatly enjoyed reading this magazine in years past. However, I have not received anything yet from my Amazon.com order. I am eagerly waiting for my subscription to start!!
Certainly this album offers very little to a fan of The Ocean Blue's eariler work.  The vocals and guitars sound quite different (gone is that beautiful dreamy sound).  And what about those awesome saxaphone and  keyboard sounds that made their earlier tracks so fun?  Just because Steve  Lau is gay is no reason for the band to abandon keyboards altogether.  So,  anyway, what does this album offer instead?  Harder sounding guitar,  angrier sounding vocals, and songs that are somewhat intersting, but are  lacking in any magic that would make you want to listen to them after  you've had the CD for a couple weeks.  Exceptions: "Whenever You're  Around", and "Slide" are good enough songs to standout  inspite of boring production
I use MS Office at work, and at home, but for my daughter's computer this was perfect.  --- Most people don't need the full version of office, and this package has so much for so little money. --- The full version of Word is reason enough to spend this amount of money. Note: This is not the latest version, but who cares. --- I would say this is one of the best software deals out there. Unless you need 100% office compatiblity, this is the package for you. If you do, buy the student and teacher version of MS Office. Read the fine print, it is for anyone not using it for business
This is my second projector - I used an NEC for the last four years, but that died on me recently.  And, boy, am I glad it died - I am amazed by the quality of the AX100U - the pictures and colors almost  jump off the screen at you.  Also, the oft mentioned LDC projector 'screen door' effect is virtually non-existant - you have to stand almost next to the screen to notice it.  I believe Panny used some smoothening technology to achieve it.  The contrast is also truely outstanding for an LCD projector - at par with DLP systesm, but without the headaches of the rainbow effect. ---  --- Couple of pointers which might be helpful to other users.  When I first started using the projector with my DVD player I was getting some wavy curls (not too visible, but still there) that seemed to flow across the screeen.  However, after about 4-5 hours of use, they have disappeared - so if any of you see those wavy curls, just give it a few hours and hopefully yours will disappear as well. ---  --- Secondly, unlike my old NEC I was getting a flickering shimmer when using my HD box from my cable company.  The shimmer was just at the edge of teh picture.  There is an easy fix for this.  Go to options, overscan, and you can actually crop the edge of the image and  not see it any more...voila - no flickers and an incredible picture.  ---  --- Be aware that this is big, bulky projector compared to some others out there.  Definately not a portable one - you don't want to be lugging it home from work after presentations to see home pictures.  This was designed as a dedicated home theater projector, not a portable presentation device.   ---  --- I highly recommend this projector - you've got to see the picture to believe it - I didn't think it was possible at this price range. --- 
I'm only a little bit of a coffee nut, but I really like this coffee. My fiance's father brought some back from Costa Rica while he was there on business. I have just finished my bag and already miss it. This was one of the best coffees I have tasted. Well balanced, not too acidic, not too bitter, just right in my opinion. It's really good served traditionally hot, but it's also great iced. And as with all coffees... it's best if you get whole bean and grind it yourself. ---  --- My opinion... a must try
This is just great for a single VPU video card, the cooling system works great, moving all the hot air outside the CPU. The software overclock is good too, u can change values any time u want and u can select if u want those applied for 3D games only. --- It works with any game, I've tested it with Oblivion at 1280x1024, HDR enabled and every option at maximum. It works great with F.E.A.R at 1280x1024 with AAx8 and FFA x 4 --- the price is good for a very high end video cards
It is simple, handy and works well to prevent shaking your camera. But I am still doubt if this simple accessory really deserves 50 bucks... This wired release would be the choice only if you are not a Digital Rebel user who has a more reasonable price option for the additional shutter button.
It took a week and half to receive it - 3 days to get confirmation for the order only, and they ship by regular mail; ---  --- then there's a single protective screen pre-cut in a plastic, it doesn't cover well the whole screen surface (it's about 1-2 mm narrower) and it's very tough, hard to put it in place without drawing dust or leaving fingerprints underneath, I had to take it off immediately, then once removed from place it's a waste
Was very disappointed by the performance of this unit.  Not enough pressure.  Pretty useless even with new batteries
I had been using this product for 2 weeks now. No problems/discomfort. Quality stuff
This is by far the best tea you will ever find if you like a bold, in your face, but not overwhelming taste of cinnamon & oranges instead of just flavored water like other teas.   ---  --- You must be very careful handling the tea bags from the essential oils they use.  I love to smell tea so I placed the tea bag to my nose and took a whiff, then cried for the next 30 minutes as my nose was on fire!!  No amount of water or soap could remove the burning from the oils that were displaced on my nose.  Also don't directly touch it or reach into the bag with acrylic nails.  I ruined a fresh french manicure and learned the hard way - the essential oils leave a green film on your nails that takes days to wear off. ---  --- Other than that, just try it once and you will be hooked like all the others!  My boss introduced this to me after she came back with it from a trip to Seatle.  I've been ordering it ever since along with all my other co-workers who became a addicted.  It will brighten any day!!!!!! 
Very Yummy Potatoes (and chick peas)...very tasty and not too spicy hot.  I recommend it highly as a side dish or over a dead animal or rice. ---  --- So easy to make---boil water, warm in packet under water for about 5 minutes, carefully lift out of water, grip, rip, pour
I have used lots of PrintMaster versions I had some trouble with version 16 with the address book so I was happy to find that a new version was out and called to order they told me I wouldn't have a problem with the new one.  This new version is JUNK; all the projects have to be downloaded so if you don't have a high speed connection forget it!  I don't like the fact that you have to go on line every time you want to create a card etc.  I sent a note to customer service and just received a generic response.  So looks like I have to find new software
I first saw this movie around 1980, when the Cold War was still on. I had been inundated with propaganda from birth, that all Russians talked about was political, that they didn't do "normal" things or live a normal life. All politics you know. Well, here was this movie about the lives and loves of three women. It was very well acted, and basically, just a long soap! I loved it--and not one word about Lenin, Marx, or anti-Americanisms. I recently saw it again, and liked it just as much. For those who say it is unrealistic--well, how do you know? Do you think that all Russians lived the exact same life? Or because American Cold War propaganda stated that all Russians were totally miserable
im really sorry about my review below. my friend did it without me knowing off my accout. im really sorry
I saw the movie in a theater when it first came out. I was a teenager and, although I believed it to be primarily a girl's movie, I did enjoy it. I've seen it several times since then, and it still has not lost its charm. When I finally did read the book, I was disappointed that the movie didn't follow it more closely. To me, these are two different stories. The Holly in the movie is likeable; the novella's Holly is a harpie who cares for no one or nothing else. (When my wife saw the movie, she remarked that Holly was, "an idiot.") However, the book's storyline is more interesting...more haunting, and the book's ending is more intriguing. The movie ends as a love story. The book is much more. And, oh yes, whatever you may think of Capote as an individual, the guy was a damn good writer
I have been using a Chemex 10-cup coffee maker for almost a year and have never had such good coffee before in my life. I am constantly looking forward to my next pot of coffee! ---  --- There is a downside to this coffee maker: it is a more manual procedure than what you are used to, and it also takes a couple of pots to learn how to use this most efficiently. The first time I tried to use mine, I had ground my coffee way too finely and it just took forever! The big time consumers: you have to boil your water separately (you do have a water kettle right?) and then you have to gradually pour the boiled water through the Chemex. This means that while the coffee is brewing, you are pouring, or watching, or giving the filter area a bit of a stir. ---  --- Now the up side: you will never ever ever drink a better cup of coffee. I use filtered water, freshly ground home roasted beans, and this Chemex to produce the finest coffee I have ever had the pleasure of drinking. And this coffee is a pleasure! In fact, I've totally given up using cream and sugar because my coffee no longer has anything to hide. ---  --- Another up side: clean up means swishing the Chemex with warm water and tossing the water down the drain. You can also wash with a bottle brush but this is rarely necessary. A brief swish is really all it takes to get your Chemex looking factory new. Try that with your electric drip machine! Ha! That thing will NEVER look brand new! ---  --- Oh, here's a final upside: this Chemex brews the best coffee you'll ever drink, and it costs less than just about anything. You are probably already spending more money than this every month at Starbucks! ---  --- Go ahead and buy yourself one of these. If necessary, wake up 10 minutes earlier to make your coffee. Better yet, wake up 20 minutes earlier. And when your coffee is ready, instead of dumping it into a travel cup and bolting out the door, sit down and enjoy your first cup for the next 10 minutes. You deserve it
I've had a GE and a Sony (CD543RM) kitchen under counter units.  I've also tested a few others in stores.  The Sony 543 model is superior to any other unit out their and the Sony 553 is superior to the Sony 543.  The 553 is worth the extra bucks for the better sound quality and AM/FM reception. 
This game takes place on a group of islands twenty years after the events of Chrono Trigger.  This game also takes place between two parallal worlds hence the name Chrono CROSS.  In this game you have the ability to recruit up to 44 characters.  To get all of them you will need to play through the game at least 3 times.  You will probably WANT to play the game more times anyway depending on how long it takes you understand the story line considering it is VERY complex. ---  --- I wouldn't recommend this game to someone who doesn't like RPG's or long games.  It took me at least 50+ hours to get through the game the first time, and that was with the guide book!!!  If you plan on getting this game I would also suggest the guide book for it as well.  Because there are somethings you would not find for the life of you unless you had something telling where to go and what to do.  For example some of the characters 7th level tech skills are impossible to find and get without the book.  You can find the Chrono Cross Guide on Amazon as well, but beware it usually isn't cheap. ---  --- If you liked any of the Final Fantasy games you would probably like this game as well.   ---  --- Something else to keep in mind is that the battle system is somewhat different that any other game you don't use MP, you use what are called elements.  These take the place of magical attacks.  There is a down side to the elements though when you wish to change characters you must remove all the elements you had on that character so you can place them on another character.  This can be VERY TIME CONSUMING especially later in the game when you have lots of element slots to fill.  Beware you WILL HAVE to do this a lot.  But don't let that get you down.  This is an exellant game despite all that. ---  --- With all that being said I would highly recommend this game to any RPG fan. ---  --- Hope this review helps.
Good quality for the great price.  Bought for my 10 year old son and should fit perfect.  Item was on backorder but still received in less than a week
The bike came in a timely fashion however it seemed to be damaged during delivery.  I returned the item for a refund
To the reviewers who report that the grille doesn't get hot enough, the slightest breeze blows the flame out and you should need to stock up on extra gas cannisters, I would point out: --- THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE CHARCOAL MODEL!! ---    Once the coals are fully going on mine, nothing short of Hurricane Katrina could blow them out, and with the proper amount of charcoal loaded in, you have all the heat you'll ever need. I have nothing but praise for mine. Nice going, Weber
After breaking the collective hearts of the soft rock-loving populace by leaving the powerhouse group Chicago, Traitor Cetera made a half-baked attempt to reconcile himself with his fanbase by recording this stinker.  It's coincidental that the first track is titled "Big Mistake", as if Traitor knew his leaving one of the premier groups of our time was the worst decision he would ever make.  I bought this album way back in 1986 with some birthday money, and after I had listened to the album once, I made myself go and apologize to all of my family members for wasting their money so foolishly. ---   --- What else is here?  Oh, you have the "Karate Kid II" ballad "Glory of Love", a tune so nauseating it's made me completely ignore the second film in the canon, and go straight from the original "Karate Kid" to "III" and "Next" whenever I do my yearly film marathon.  I just pretend the second film never existed.  It also has the semi-smash "Next Time I Fall", where Traitor makes it a point to hog the spotlight completely from guest vocalist Amy Grant. ---   --- In short, if you a) thought Cetera's leaving Chicago was a great decision, or b) like your music pointless and nauseating, by all means get this album.  If you want music with real heart and soul, just go buy some Chicago.  You'll be glad you did
DO NOT BUY THIS MAGAZINE! FOR ANY PRICE, IT IS TOO EXPENSIVE. MARIE CLAIRE HAS HARASSED ME REPEATEDLY TO PAY FOR MY SUBSCRIPTION.  IT WAS PAID FOR IN ADVANCE THRU AMAZON. I HAVE SENT THEM COPIES OF MY AMAZON RECEIPT TWICE.  THEY ARE REPORTING ME TO A CREDIT AGENCY FOR NON-PAYMENT.  AVOID THEM, AVOID THEM.  THEY ARE SCAM ARTISTS AND WILL FALSELY AND WITH MALICE DESTROY YOUR CREDIT RATING. --- 
Absolutely scrumptious granola that is good for you...low fat, high fiber, a delicious alternative to the bland, tasteless granolas produced by the major American cereal makers.  I've tried virtually all of the Back to Nature products and each and every one is sensational. Do yourself a favor and try this product. Highly recommended
If you study Pilates then you will see how the performers do not have the proper body positions. One of the girls keeps staring at the camera for no reason and moving her body when it should be still. ---  --- As a lover of Pilates and how much it has done for me, I urge you to buy something else
This concept is good but the user interface and playability is terrible.  My 7-year old was frustrated with being forced to use the keyboard and no mouse.  And we couldn't figure out a way to go back to the main menu without exiting the game.  And playing a later level requires you to go through all the earlier levels.  And...did they actually test this thing on humans?  What a waste of potential.  It is a good concept
This scent has sweet floral undertones but with a light clean effect.  Many perfumes make me sneeze, but not this line.  I get many compliments while wearing this.  I sometimes layer it with Amazing Grace, another scent in the Philosophy line.  You won't be disappointed
I love EVERY track on Ne-Yo's CD "in my own words!" Next let me thank Ne-Yo for bringing true R&B back to the industry! I dont consider songs about cheating on your bf/gf/husband/wife R&B. R&B is supposed to be about love - thats why people call them slow LOVE songs. And from 2001 - 2005 new slow love songs didn't exist. I ended up listenin to the same songs from da 90's over and over until I got so tired of them, and was fortunate to be lucky enough for my radio station (that plays mostly rap: a genre of music I dont like) to play "so sick" by Ne-Yo. It was a great song. This is literally the FIRST and only R&B album that I never have the urge to use the fast forward feature to get to the next song! Ne-Yo's lyrics are strictly romantic and sweet too! He is a lyrical genius. His voice is soothing and melodic. Most R&B albums obviously have rap tracks or rushed R&B songs as filler to probably meet the deadline or get the CD out as fast as possible and reducing the enjoyability of the CD, but THIS album has ALL songs that are great. All of the tracks on this album are great, but here are the ones that are SUPERB: ---  --- 1. So sick - 9/10 (would be a 10 if it wasn't played over and over and with so many different versions. Although I can still listen to it over and over --- 2. When you're mad - 9/10 (for those guys who like the look on girls faces when they get mad. Maybe for Michelle Rodriguez fans. :) ) --- 3. Get Down Like that 10/10 (both versions) (I call it "dont get down like that") (This song is for the guys that are completely faithful like me) (if you're not a player, and proud of being faithful, this is da song for you) --- 4. Sexy Love - 10/10 (great song. um hmmm.. what can i say about THIS one about its lyrics?.... oh yes.... this song is for the guys who have a girl and when she touches them, it just feels like.... Magic.) ---  --- This is da only CD dat ever deserved 5 stars by me, the only reason I gave OTHER R&B albums 5 stars is cuz i took into consideration: there was no R&B album that existed that had NOTHING but good tracks, and most had poorly done upbeat song
Vote this one off the island: 19 overproduced prog-tropical instrumentals consisting entirely of primitive thumping, chanting and grunting - sort of a new age tribal orgy with pygmy porn music composed by Phil Collins. It's all supposed to convey the drama, intrigue and relevance of a TV show (Survivor Yell, Mud Bath, Chase Race, Tally the Vote, I Can See It, Buzzed) with no drama, intrigue and relevance. A desperate last ditch dig for one of the most unimportant moments in television
If you love roses, this is a romantic bath luxury, with seven rose buds for your bathing delight. For a candlelit bath with romance, let it dissolve unencumbered. For scent but no mess, put it in a mesh bag first, because little flower bits will be all over the tub. At least it has no glitter. The scent is not particularly strong, but it is full of a natural rose scent that smells wonderful
You can pay hundreds more for the same product, but why?  This watch has everything th emore expensive brands do, but it costs much less.  It is not a cheapy either, it still has the Pulsar durability, and usefulness.  Great buy
I bought these things because I really hate silverfish in my apartment. Before I used them I only found silverfish in my bathroom. At first I put a big one (for large room) in the living room and one week later I found a silverfish on the wall just 1 foot distance from this repeller. After that I got two for medium room and I put one in my bedroom and one in my bathroom.  Several weeks later I found one silverfish in my bedroom (near the repeller) then I thought these things might be pest attractors. So I unplugged the one in my bedroom and put it in the kitchen. But I still found silverfish in my bedroom and bathroom, and living room, but no one in the kitchen until now. Hmm, now I think these stupid things are just night lights.
100 Men and a Girl is the story of a group of musicians who are out of work. They seem to be led by one man (Adolph Menjou) whose energetic daughter Patsy (Deanna Durbin) will stop at nothing to see her father and their friends find work. She decides to bother famed conductor Leopold Stokowski for help, but he only becomes annoyed. Instead, she finds a rich woman who promises nonchalantly to sponsor an orchestra if it existed. Patsy proceeds to gain hope and organizes the orchestra only to find that the woman has left for Europe. Patsy decides that her only choice is to berate the woman's husband and Stokowski for support, ensuing great comedy.  ---  --- Deanna Durbin is still a little girl in this film, bright and cheerful. She has a great sense of comic timing and displays her usual charm. The songs she sings "It's Raining Sunbeams," "A Heart That's Free," "Hallelujah in F Major," and "Traviata" are operatic but well sung.  ---  --- Mischa Auer plays Michael, one of the musicians, and a very funny one at that. He adds plenty of laughs to the film.  ---  --- There are a few spots where a black box rims the film during montage sequences. This is a bit distracting, but otherwise, the camerawork is excellent. One notable scene is where the unemployed orchestra congregates on a staircase to play the "Second Hungarian Rhapsody," photographed artistically and beautifully
If you want the original recordings, don't purchase any volume of Television's Greatest Hits.  I've had better luck recording the songs off of my TV with a cassette tape recorder and then dehissing them on my PC.  These collections have sterile sounding fake stereo recordings of "The Beverly Hillbillies" and "The Munsters" that just don't sound right to me.  If the original recordings don't matter to you, then you may like this CD
I love my Nextel i530.  Purchased it almost a year ago now.  I am in northern Ohio and travel many places around the state.  No matter where I have gone, and I take my phone everywhere with me, I have yet to find a place where my phone doesn't have Nextel service.  Also, very durable phone.  I live on a farm here, and we use the two-way often to communicate.  My phone in particular has been dropped several times, once off a grain bin onto concrete 35 feet below, and once also driven over by four wheeler in mud.  Still works like new.  I am extremely happy with Nextel's service and phones.  I know several other people with different model Nextel phones and also can't complain.  I would definitely recommend Nextel over Verizon, Alltel, Cingular, and Sprint.  Other companies have such cheap phones it seems.  It's a shame that Sprint and Nextel merged - from my experience with Sprint, they are terrible with no service anywhere, and their phones suck too
I cannot believe this book had such a high number of positive reviews. I have read some bad books in my life but this one is one of the absolute worst!I am amazed that all the references to CHILD murder and rape can be overlooked by the rest of the reviewers
Scientific American Mind shares all the fascinating news in brain/mind research in a realatively easy-to-understand writing sytle. ---  --- The illustrations are excellent...lucid and colorful. 
Neuske's Bacon is simply the most divine bacon eating experience you'll ever have.  Smoked in Wisconsin over applewood, it is delectable, luscious even.  They cut it lean so that there is no rubbery, fatty bits like you find in store-bought brands, yet they leave enough in to give it that robust flavor.  It is worth noting that America's Test Kitchen did a Taste Test of Bacon, in which Neuske's was a participant.  It did NOT come out as No.1, because tasters thought it was "too smoky".  If you like smoky bacon like I do, that sounds like crazy talk, and you should definitely try this bacon.  The results of the taste test indicates to me that there are those who prefer their bacon less smoky, and I suppose that if you are one of those people, you may not like this bacon after all (even thought it is the best ever). ---  --- Be careful though: once you eat Neuske's and love it, you won't be satisfied with store-bought ever again
I like the sound I get from the mic and it is very good valuue for the money for prosumer cam owners, but consumer-level camera owners should beware. ---  --- I bought this mic and found that it was way too sensitive/hot for consumer cameras like a Panasonic gs200 which has no audio input level control. It picks up too much background noise and overwhelms the camera's automatic gain controller when things get loud. I'm not sure if the gs200 had a mic attenuation setting or if turning it on would have been a sufficient answer. I put a cheap radio shack in-line volume controller in between the mic and the camera (which can introduce crackle if you adjust it while recording). ---  --- On prosumer cams with input level control like the Canon GL2 it works fine, even without turning on mic attenuation. If you have a camcorder with input level controls I might get this. ---  --- Another important caveat: You cannot run this mic through a the 1/8" connection of a Beachtek mixer box. You'll hear nothing on the beachtek's output because of an impedance mismatch. I don't know if putting an XLR adapter on the mic cable would work
We bought two pairs of these (his and hers - sizes Large and Regular) direct from the manufacturer. The gloves in both sets were of different sizes, and workmanship on everything was poor and clearly would not stand up to regular use. Too bad, because the concept is great.
I LOVE this pillow. I've had it for about two and a half months now. At first it helped me stay on my side, and was just comfy to snuggle up to. Now that my belly is getting bigger, it gives great support and doesn't let my belly "hang" down. This is great for people who don't always sleep on their sides as once you position it you are unlikely to roll over in your sleep. I've had no problem with the stuffing. If you are looking for super firm support, try a wedge. This is a pillow, and feels as such. Of course, if you are on a budget, you can always just use a regular pillow, but if you want to pamper yourself the unique shape of this pillow makes it extra comfortable. ---  --- **UPDATE** I'm now 8 months pregnant and love my pillow! Mine came covered in a zippered cover, so that is what I wash.  Every few nights, I just grab the larger part and shake it HARD until the stuffing falls down, then fluff it and it is as good as new. I also like that, yes, it does take up some room, but no where near as much room as many pregnancy pillows. All in all, whether you like this pillow or not will come down to personal choice
We have a small home and decided to opt for this type of high chair instead of a stand alone. We just love it and so does our 6 month old
Wasn't worth the subscription. I found the magazine to be bland, full of ads and basically boring. All the information can be found doing a quick web search. Highly Disappointed
This is a decent book on photographing artwork -- but not the the most comprehensive.  The strengths of this book are that Mr. Saddington (1) discusses the use digital media, and (2) makes the process of photographing artwork very user-friendly by providing great visual references throughout.  The user-friendly aspect is the book's strongest selling point, especially for artists who are new or novices at photography, or visually oriented (i.e., no patience for reading instructions that come with few or no pictures).  Mr. Saddington's book provides pictures of what makes a bad negative exposure/photograph, and provides a concise explanation for these results, and does the same for an example of a good negative exposure/photograph.  He also provides illustrations of setting up equipment and artwork for photographing.  The weakness of this book lies in the general details provided ... unfortunately, Mr. Saddington provides a limited amount of helpful hints and leaves out specific details for for problem shooting ... I base this opinion on my comparison of this book with a book called "Photographing Your Artwork" by Russell Hart.  If you buy Mr. Saddington's book, I'd recommend supplementing it with the purchase of Mr. Hart's book.  The two books complement each other.  Where Mr. Saddington's book lacks in details, Mr. Hart's book fills in the information gaps.  On the other hand, Mr. Hart's book is very text heavy and has very few illustrations ... so if you're a visually-oriented person, Mr. Saddington's book would easily compensate in the area of illustrating this very important process.  Again, Mr. Saddington's book is decent, but it should be used as a supplemental reference, especially for the visually-oriented person
Not many writers can characterize children realistically. Somehow a stylized silhouette emerges and the child fades in the background and the plot or adult characters take over the storyline and the children characters end up being nothing more than fluff. This is definately not one of those novels. Carson mcCullers writes almost with artistic persicion on her two most elaborate characters, F. Jasmine and John Henry West. I really cannot think of another story, maybe, A Good Man is Hard to Find, by Flannery O'Conner, where the writer can get inside the mind of a child; evoking their unique thoughts and feelings with a sense of ease. John Henry West is one of the most well rounded and well written children I have ever read, and that is a great homage to her writing ability.  ---  --- *I first read this at ten, can see that age or older reading it. Will have a intense impact on a sensitive pre teen reader
I thought I was fairly familiar with the Sanibel Island area, but this book definitely gave me new insight. The author definitely "knows her stuff" and has written a very informative and interesting guide. Anyone visiting Sanibel (especially first-timers) should definitely get a copy before they go.
This coffee is smooth and is not bitter at all. It is wonderfully aromatic and a rich flavor. I personally bought the beans in Jamaica but it was only $12 for 12 ounces, I have seen such inflated prices on the internet for this product and truly it is not worth it
This is not an xD to Compactflash card adapter. If you order this item number, you will receive a PC card adapter that accepts xD picture cards and SmartMedia cards and fits your PCMIA 2.1 slot on a PC or Mac. It is not for a camera or substitute for a Compactflash card. There is nothing compact flash about it. The product you will recieved does not look like the photo on amazon's website
I love the scent of the Grapefruit-Bergamot bubble bath.  This combination is suitable for men or women.  Deep Steep products are really first rate.  The foot scrub and lotions are well worth the money
Got perfume for my wife she loves it, me too of course.
What if you're a runaway secret agent, really, really, really tired of the war. Then some geek tells you he's found a genuine Martian artifact leading to a spaceship. What would you do? ---  --- Annoyingly, as you set out to recover the spaceship, there's just a little bit of sabotage. And there's the war, still. And then there's the spaceship. And you uncover something of why the Martians have abandoned space as you know it. ---  --- It's Takeshi. Taking the lead. Uncovering a big secret. Trying to find a way out of war, only to discover there's been little change since the Martians left. No change, really. There's still a war..
This 2-disc DVD set is a must have! Herein are contained 29 classic shorts spanning from 1930 to 1947, in the first of what will likely be a 2 volume collection. Included are some of Pluto's, and Disney's best cartoons, from the Oscar winning remake "Lend a Paw," to the first appearance of Chip `N' Dale in "Private Pluto." Here is a rundown of what you get in this wonderful DVD set! ---  --- Disc 1: --- The Chain Gang (1930): In this black and white Mickey Mouse short, Mickey is a prisoner in a chain gang who, after musical antics result in a riot, makes a break for it! Two bloodhounds, officially considered the first appearance of Pluto in a double role, are hot on his trail. --- On Ice (1935): In this early, color Mickey Mouse cartoon, the whole gang is enjoying a day on the ice, but Donald Duck's prank playing nature puts Pluto in the spotlight. --- Pluto's Quin-Puplets (1937): In this familiar classic, the first "official" Pluto short, we meet Pluto's family, as his mate, Fifi, leaves him to watch over their 5 puppies while she goes after some sausages. The outcome of which is a drunken Pluto and a fascinating paint catastrophe, resulting in some bizarre looking pups. Great short! --- Beach Picnic (1939): Donald Duck, the official star of this short, sets out to have a picnic on the beach with Pluto in tow, but the day is spoiled by a familiar flypaper routine and those pesky ants! The Duck and the dog are GREAT together! --- Bone Trouble (1940): Butch and Pluto battle it out over a bone here, the highlight of which is that famous funhouse mirror routine that saves the day! Great moments with Pluto in the hall of mirrors! --- Pluto's Playmate (1941): While Pluto is playing with a ball on the beach, a seal takes interest and becomes determined to make friends, despite the dog's resistance. Classic type of Pluto story, to be repeated again and again in future shorts. --- Canine Caddy (1941): Mickey heads out for a game of golf, but Pluto and a gopher louse things up! --- Lend a Paw (1941): This Oscar winning short about kindness to animals is pure Disney magic! Surprisingly, it's a remake of a black and white Mickey short! Great story about Pluto regretfully rescuing a drowning kitten that starts to take his place in Mickey's home. Pluto's devil and angel make their most memorable appearance in this one!  --- Pluto, Junior (1942): Pluto's pup, Pluto Junior, can't seem to stay out of danger, even in his own backyard! --- The Army Mascot (1942): Pluto notices how well fed the local Army mascots are and decides to try to replace one of them. He foolishly chooses a grouchy goat!  --- The Sleepwalker (1942): Pluto meets his second great cartoon love, Dina the Dachshund, in this classic short. However, he's more interested in hanging onto his bone than sparking romance. Too bad his sleepwalking is working against him. --- T-Bone For Two (1942): Pluto and Butch the bulldog clash again, in another epic battle over a bone. --- Pluto At the Zoo (1942): This excellent short is full of animal antics, as Pluto attempts to steal a bone from a lion's dish at the zoo. Love the gorilla scene! ---  --- Disc 2: --- Pluto and the Armadillo (1943): On a trip to Brazil, Pluto's ball gets mixed up with a friendly Armadillo in a brief stop off between flights! Very cute short that features Mickey, too!  --- Private Pluto (1943): Pluto is given orders to guard a cannon from suspected saboteurs. To our delight, those saboteurs are Chip `N' Dale in their first ever appearance! They're living in the gun and using it to crack and store their nut supply! --- Springtime For Pluto (1944): This rarely seen, very colorful Pluto short is a pure delight! It's rarities like this that are the gold nuggets of the Disney Treasures series! The Pan-like Spirit of Spring awakes Pluto to a bright new day, but his enjoyment is eventually smothered by the down-sides of nature. --- First Aiders (1944): Hooray, Pluto and Figaro! This short is one of those great Disney team-ups that features a star from Disney's "Pinocchio," Figaro the cat! In this old fave of mine (I love Pluto and Figaro shorts), the boys battle it out while Minnie attempts to practice her first-aid skills on them. --- Dog Watch (1945): This is another fave of mine! Pluto is a Navy dog, and is given orders to keep intruders off the ship. A pesky rat causes trouble for him though, setting his sights on the ship's galley! --- Canine Casanova (1945): Pluto is madly in love with Dina, but can't get her to return the sentiment, until he rescues her from the local dog pound! --- The Legend of Coyote Rock (1945): Another old fave! Pluto is a sheepdog that has to fend off the legendary Bent Tail, the coyote! --- Canine Patrol (1945): In this short, Pluto works for the U.S. Coast Guard and takes his job a little too seriously, doing his best to keep a cute little turtle off the beach!  --- Pluto's Kid Brother (1946): K.B. can't stay out of trouble, and he badly needs big bro Pluto's help when Butch tricks him into robbing a butcher shop! --- In Dutch (1946): Pluto is the local milk delivery dog in a little Dutch village. He and Dina get in trouble one day, when Pluto's wooing results in a false dike alarm sounding off. But, when the dike actually does spring a leak, it's Pluto and Dina who save the day! --- Squatter's Rights (1946): Chip `N' Dale are back to torment Pluto again, when Mickey and Pluto find them living in the stove of a cabin they are vacationing in!  --- The Purloined Pup (1946): A wealthy puppy has been dognapped! It's up to police dog Pluto to locate the poor pup in the hideout of the number one suspect, Butch the bulldog! --- Pluto's Housewarming (1947): When Pluto is moving into a luxurious new doghouse, he discovers an unwanted houseguest in the form of that cute little turtle. He has bigger things to worry about, though, when Butch decides to move in too!  --- From the Vault: Pantry Pirate (1940), separated due to ethnic stereotype content: Pluto does his best to sneak food from the kitchen without the housekeeper suspecting. --- From the Vault: A Gentleman's Gentleman (1941), separated due to ethnic stereotype content: One of Pluto's best cartoons, Pluto is the perfect dog to his master, Mickey, and takes every aspect of his role very seriously, including going to the corner to buy a paper. ---  --- This is a fantastic collection of classic Disney cartoons, necessary for the Disney or Pluto fanatic! Extras include introductions from Leonard Maltin, Pluto 101 (an in-depth look into drawing and animating Pluto), The Life and Times of Pluto (a featurette about the pup himself), Pluto's Picture Book (a section of the Disneyland TV Show episode "A Story of Dogs," that focuses on the career of Pluto), Pluto's Pal Fergy (a tribute to Norm Ferguson, the animator credited with developing Pluto), fantastic photo galleries (including Sunday comics, posters, backgrounds, etc...), a DVD booklet, a certificate of authenticity, and a lovely collectible poster art card. The packaging has gone a little cheaper than past releases (no more paper wraparounds, no more printing on the back of the tin), and I'm getting more and more annoyed with only getting half-episodes of the Disneyland TV series. Will it kill `em to give us complete eps? Otherwise, another outstanding Disney Treasures set! Can't wait for the next wave, and Pluto volume 2!
I will only use Krusell products as they are better than Best. Customer Service is as good as the product. There is no finer quality and the selection of products is well above the rest. Krusell products cost a little more but quality and durability far surpass the price. The rating should be a 10
I got this potty for my baby shower.  I registered for it because it was Safety first and most of their products are excellent.  I set it out to introduce it to my son( he was just beginning to show interest not ready to actually start yet).  We never actually used it since the top of the seat and I mean the entire top kept falling off even with nobody sitting on it.  Even if you just moved the potty it would fall apart. --- Instead we bought a plain potty seat by Graco and it is excellent!
This product is not what it is cracked up to be.  I ordered it, and it doesn't really work too well, i think a button with a piece of elastic would be better.  There is not enough expansion room , its just like not really using anything at all.  Sorry, but i thought the product was not that good. 
I kept passing by this one in the video store. I figured that I would have heard of it if it was any good, right? ---  --- Wrong. It's almost ten years old as of this writing, and I never heard of it, and it's really good. I mean, Really Good, in lots of ways. It's got characters I can really care about. There's Leaven, for one (Nicole de Boer, aka Dax of DS9). She starts out as the stereotypical wimpy, screamy girl. Then there's Quentin, who starts out the take-charge cop, the one you're sure will get our little band out of this lethal labyrinth. Just keep two things in mind. First, everyone changes over the course of the movie. Second, wanting to see some jerk get it is also a kind of caring, just not a nice one. ---  --- The way the characters change is another thing to like. This movie borders on the minimalist, and its fair to say they didn't spend a terrible lot on sets and props. The characters carry everything, and do it surprisingly well. This isn't a Great Movie in the sense of literary snobishness, but still a heck of a flick. The actors, plus the script they're given to work with, really make the movie. Another bit to like is that spending thing - they didn't do much. The actors are all good, but not in the gazillion-dollar class. Sets and props are well done, but there's not much to them. Costuming couldn't have cost more than $20 for each of seven actors. All this proves that money doesn't make a movie: artists and artistic vision do. Maybe money helps, but Cube shows that you can still get a big-budget feel on a very modest budget. ---  --- What's not to like? The ending. I'll let you get there on your own. Maybe that's why this movie didn't take off and make a boatload of money for everyone involved. But, they didn't spend a lot, so I hope they all went happily to the bank anyway. They deserve every nickel they made from it. ---  --- //wiredweir
Almost 2 years ago, my fiance and I signed up for a 2-year contract with Verizon. We got a great deal for both phones. And two years later, both phones are in excellent condition with very few scratches and dents. This is a great phone for someone who would still like the option to take pictures and short videos but does not use it heavily. I have 38 pictures saved on my phone right now and sending picture messages is extremely easy and relatively quick with this phone.  ---  --- Pros: ---  - Sturdy: It's not as thin or flimsy as some of the newer ultra-thin        phones. I have dropped my phone so many times and my phone is still in excellent condition. Another thing I really like is that when you drop the phone, the battery doesn't detach easily. Everytime I dropped my old sony ericsson, the battery would also detach and I'd have to restart my phone. ---  - Compact: Though it is on the thicker side, this Samsung is very compact but not too small where you fear loosing it.  ---  - Good Buttons: For those who text message a lot, the way the buttons feel can really make a difference. The buttons on this phone are smooth and great for texting. ---  - Menu & short cuts: On the side of the phone, you can adjust your ringtone volume by simply pressing the up or down arrow. If you hold #, your phone goes into vibrate mode. If press the camera button on the right hand side of the phone the camera & video menu pop up. You can also choose which shortcut you'd like when you press "up," I have mine set on the calendar.  ---  - Long battery life: I'm not one to spend hours on my cell phone, but for every day use, this phone is great with respect to its battery life. There have been times when I forget to charge my phone and go 2 days without charging and it is still close to fully charged. ---  - Camera has flash & other neat options: You can also adjust the brightness level, have a self timer, take multiple shots, 10 different "fun frames," and 5 different colortones like sepia, monochrome (black & white and negative.  ---  - Zoom: You can zoom upto X4.  ---  - Phonebook: Contacts are easy to access and it's easy to search for entries. I like the fact that you can enter multiple numbers under one name. You can enter that persons home, mobile, fax, office and pager number. You can also enter an alias and email address. You can assign a personalized ring tone and picture and you can categorize your contacts in different groups. ---  - Voice commands:By pressing & holding the * button, a voice command menu appears. It's a nice feature but is not something I often use. ---  - Speed dailing: One feature that I do take advantage of is speed dailing. It's nice only having to press a button to instantly connect with another person. ---  - Menu styles: There are 2 different menu styles you can use. I like the nature option which has cute animation for each subcategory you scroll through. My fiance uses the icon style which is a more simple design. ---  - Custom welcome and goodbye screen. ---  --- Cons: ---  - Video quality is poor and very pixelated. My phone only holds 2 15-second videos. ---  - Despite the generous 15 ring tones, it's hard finding a ringtone that doesn't make you want to pull your hair out. Out of the 15 ring tones, there are only about 2 decent ring tones. ---  - Antenna: I don't use the antenna very often but when I do, it has a hard time staying up and is very flimsy. ---  - Picture quality is not the best. If you intend on taking a lot of pictures I would recommend investing in a better picture phone. ---  - Does not have V-Cast. ---  - No MP3 player. ---  --- Overall: This cell phone is exactly that, a cell phone to make calls. It has some additional features like picture taking and video and organization tools like the phonebook and planner but it is still a fairly basic phone.
SIX DEGREES OF SEPARATION is an outstanding play transformed to the screen with dignity but with a script that keeps us in the live theatre instead of in a motion picture.  Not that that is a bad thing: the script by John Guare is brilliant.  It simply seems a little static, with its marvelous plays on words, repeated phrases, and disjointed movements significant unto themselves but not really taking advantage of cinematic possibilities of flow. ---  --- Essentially the tale of how a married couple who deal art (Stockard Channing and Donald Sutherland - both in peak form) are so caught up in their superficial lives that they are taken in by a handsome young African American con artist (Will Smith) whose various antics bring the couple round to reexamining their shallow existence.  Most of the story is related over art dealings and dinner conversations and are peopled by such luminaries as Kitty Carlisle, Ian McKellen, artists Chuck Close and Kazuko, Mary Beth Hurt, Bruce Davidson etc - a really fine ensemble.  There are many social comments clustered in this story and it continues to play well after its origins on the stage and fifteen years after the movie was made.  This was one of Will Smith's entries into film as well as one of the gifted Stockard Channing's finest roles.  Highly recommended for repeated viewings. Grady Harp, October 0
    I really did give this a chance but I can't say I like the show. It focuses more on the "police" aspect and less on the science, which differentiates the CSI series from most of the other garbage out there. I know David Caruso has his fans but I just can't appreciate him in this vehicle...  
I consider this the first album in the second half of the career of Oasis. Following the departure of Bonehead and Guigsy, this album is basically all the Gallagher brothers. Having learnt lessons from Be Here Now, Oasis have gone back to a more basic style of production as opposed to the over the top production from Be Here Now. While the songs are not as good on here, they sound better and the whole album sounds as if it wasn't as rushed. This signifies a big change of direction for the band, with little less ego's and a more sober approach to their music, it is only the songwriting that lets this album down. My least favourite of all Oasis albums, it features two really good songs, 6 mediocre and 2 dreadful ones. It is missing another two songs to make it complete, I think it should have included the B'sides 'lets all make believe' and 'carry us all'. It still includes a few Beatle-esque songs 'who feels love' and 'roll it over' and Noel once again takes over lead vocal duties, this time on two tracks, 'where did it all go wrong' and 'sunday morning call'. --- This is a very important album, it grounded the band again after their ego's had taken off. This helped relaunch the career and because of it they sound at their best today
I am a huge fan of BBC period drama and have nearly exhausted my library's supply of miniseries based on the works of Austen, Gaskell, Dickens, and Eliot. But I would have to say that the BBC struck out this time. The direction was bad, the acting was mediocre at best, the music was obtrustive, and the screenplay was just plain awful. After the first half-hour my sisters and I survived the rest by poking fun at one cliche after another. I have not read the book so I don't know how much of it is from the source material. Makes me curious to read it, though. The costumes and some of the scenery were good; I'll give it that
I thought this book was supposed to help you construct a very useful and pretty small house on a budget.  I was wrong.  Instead, it is about not too big houses where you spend tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, on all kinds of architectural extravagances.  Perhaps this book could have a subtitle:  How to spend a million dollars on a 1,500 square foot house.  If you are looking to build a house efficiently and cheaply, this is the wrong book
This phone is a great corporate phone.  It is the best windows mobile phone currently available, in my oppinion.  ---  --- They overlooked a few features:   --- -There is no LCD light to tell you its charging status - instead the screen has to be on all the time.   --- -There is no way to know when the num lock key is on - so you just have to press a number key and see what comes up. --- -In order to unlock the phone, you have to press the on/off button at the top of the phone, which is not in a very convenient location. --- -The track wheel feels pretty cheep
My 11 week old breastfed baby was diagnosed with mild acid reflux (she doesn't vomit, it comes up in her throat causing crying spells from the heartburn).  She also has a sensitive stomach and is gassy so we decided to try these when she was 8 weeks old.  They were horrible!  We like the Playtex Premium Nurser and the Playtex Ventaire (chubby bottles) MUCH better.  We tried the regular Dr. Browns, but she choked on the nipple so we ordered the chubby bottle that has the nipples more like the breast.  With both kinds she sucked too hard and ate too fast...when I sat her up to burp her after her usual 5 minutes (@ one ounce with the Playtex bottles), to my surprise she had already sucked down 3 ounces!  We had a horrible night both times we tried the Dr. Browns - she cried all night from a bad tummy ache from the fast flow (we used the slow flow nipples even!).  I also have a friend that had the same problem with her baby choking and gagging on the slow flow nipples' too-fast-flow (formula fed baby).  I HIGHLY recommend the Playtex bottles - they are easy to clean and never leak.  We only tried Dr. Brown to see if it would alleviate the GERD symptoms - it did not!!!!
In this cynical day and age, it's truly astonishing to see a band rise from the ashes and still sound relevant (not to mention amazing), but how often do you get to see the inside picture offstage? ---  --- This film works as a eulogy to Arthur "Killer" Kane, a synopsis of the Dolls' early years, and a buoy for rock 'n' rollers lost at sea.  It's all things to all people, but it's never boring or condescending.   ---  --- I would actually recommend this film to lovers of cinema, whether they had any knowledge of the Dolls or not, simply because it's a great story, well told, and stands up to repeated viewings. --- 
This necklace is beautiful.  The chain is not skimpy and the heart locket itself is really pretty.  A great alternative to an expensive locket at a fine jeweler.  A true steal at a sale price of under $30.00
Regardless of the quality of the magazine, it is really annoying to see Oprah on every single cover! and to make it worst, she does not pick "regular Oprah shots", instead you look at every issue's front cover and ask yourself "How did they take that picture? She doesn't even look like her!" It's as if Oprah is telling all of us "See how I can look like?" Every month is just a new testimony from Oprah, that money does do wonders. ---  --- On the top of that, Oprah's personal thoughts, things, favorites, ideas, even more pictures are all over the few pages that are not advertisement. ---  --- I still gave it 2 stars because from time to time you can find a good article, but the bottom line is the question: Is this a magazine or a show off ?
I have been using v.7 from the last week or so and i am very pleased with it. It loads very fast (unlike all other adobe versions), the conversion to PDF from doc or ppt files also is much quicker.  ---  --- I have not encountered any problems yet, but its only been 7 days since i am using it.. ---  --- Definitely worth the upgrade
A very proud and highly recommended production, it's a real pitty this cd is not available, i still have this one as a precious thing, i hear it all the time as well as i want. Nobody will forget Jeff Lynne as an excellent musician, ever
My son was so excited for this toy.  It was all he asked for on his 8th birthday. We went out to the lake this week and then began our frustration.  First there is no way to launch this 30 feet unless the wind gusts and the moon and planets are alligned. Then the "safety" bobber is so safe it doesn't even open when it hits the water, but does cause such a large ripple in the lake that all fish are gone for hours. --- My son set it down after a hour of frustration and had me trek to the car to grab is old trusty fishing rod, that is not as colorful and plastic but does actually cast and catch fish. Don't get me wrong, I think the rod is a gret idea but the people who designed it did a very slipshoddy job, and I would warn anyone about spending money on it.
I bought these shoes for my husband. I ordered them on a Monday and they were at my house by Wednesday! I have owned a pair of "real" Birks before and these look identical to them. My husband loves them and they wre more than half the price of the real ones
We bought and then returned the Scuttle Bug.  It was well made and easy to snap together.  However, it was far, far too small for our 27 months old daughter - who happens to be very petite (only 25 percentile for height and weight). Her knees dragged the ground.  I think it is a cool product, but maybe for younger/smaller children.  We wound up getting a kiddio trike which is fantastic!!
This thermometer is not very accurate or consistant. Whenever my son was sick and we used this it would give a normal temperature reading and I knew that it couldn't be right. We would take our sons temperature 3 times in a row and never get the same reading twice. I even check my own temperature and it would come up with crazy readings like 95.1! We got rid of this one because fever-induced seizures run in my husbands family and we needed something more accurate. It has been my experience that nothing digital gives accurate readings and that the old-fashion oral and rectal thermometers work best
after buying some lush products from here, i went into the lush store in pasadena where the staff was awesome and totally helpful. after explaining my horrendous hair issues, they gave me some samples of rehab, retread and big and i bought a bottle of american dream. they all work wonderfully. rehab made my scalp tingly and my hair felt so soft. my hair has literally never felt better. i HIGHLY recommend rehab or any lush products for that matter
I rented this game for my 3 year old.  Who loves the movie.  He tried to play it.  He like it.  I tried to play it & got to the dancing part.  I couldn't get past it.  I tried for 5 days.  My rental time was up.  I returned it.  I haven't rented it since.  This game is way too hard to beat.  And my 3 year old got bored with it real fast.  I would NOT recommend this game to anyone.  Don't waste your money buying it.  Unless you are an expert with video games.  I'm just thankful that I rented it instead of buying it
I am giving this one star ONLY because it is on VHS and not DVD.  I don't even own a VCR anymore and had to watch it at someone elses house!!  The day that they come out with all ten seasons on DVD I will buy them all and really wish I could now!  I just bought the pilot episode on DVD and am hoping that this will sell well and that they'll go on to put all the seasons on DVD already.  I know there is still a huge worldwide fan base who would purchse them!!
 "The Dreaming was one of those albums that I found in my parents CD collection when I was young and I haven't outgrown it yet. My parents seemed to hate it and never bought a Kate Bush CD after it (though I recently bought her whole collection except "The Whole Story" as it's just a greatest hits!). This album took me a very long time to get into however. I listened to it several times as a child and then put it away because I thought it was too strange. I took it out then several years later and loved it. I would now say it could be my all time favourite CD and is better than "Hounds Of Love" as I see it. The songs all stand on their own and Bush's voice is brilliant and her quirky themes shine through. This is the only album that I will never skip a track because I'm always in the mood for them all. ---  ---  1. "Sat In Your Lap"- A great opening track. Bush deals with whether she can be bothered to do something or not. The instruments are great as always. ---  2. "There Goes A Tenner"- A notable song for the quirky British accent Bush puts on. The instruments are very good and remind me of the '80's (as it was made then!). That was a good decade for music! ---  3. "Pull Out The Pin"- The piano arrangement is excellent in this song and the chorus is so good. The lyrics are about someone who is in war and thinking about pulling out the pin of a grenade. The song was inspired by a documentary. ---  4. "Suspended In Gaffa"- I don't actually know what Gaffa is but this song is still so great and catchy. The lyrics are quirky and the instrumentation is excellent. ---  5. "Leave It Open"- An excellent song that reminds me more of "Hounds Of Love". The instrumentation is excellent as always. ---  6. "The Dreaming"- Another brilliant song which is so funny because of Bush's Australian accent. The production is good and so is the songwriting. ---  7. "Night Of The Swallow"- The use of Irish traditional music is a nice effect to this song. The singing by Bush is superb and the song is flawless! ---  8. "All The Love"- The song has a sadder feel to it but is excellent. The lyrics are unusual and very well done. The instruments complement Bush's superb voice and never overtake! ---  9. "Houdini"- The album cover is to do with this song. The song is excellent with a really quirky chorus and good instrumentation. ---  10. "Get Out Of My House"- A perfect way to end an amazing album. The lyrics are so good and it is so funny at the end when she turns into a mule (within the song obviously). It is something only Kate Bush could have written! ---  ---  Overall I think it is an amazing album though I can see why people don't like it. It could be a little too experimental for some though for me it is perfect. Kate Bush shows she was the original alternative female and the best (yes, she's better than Tori Amos). She is one of the few geniuses of music and an all time amazing artist. Reccomended to everyone into alternative, especially Tori Amos fans! ---  ---  MARK- 10/1
These earrings are of very nice quality and were what I expected. I am pleased with these
On paper, the idea of a 24 video game sounds like a great idea, and upon first glance of it, it seems like it's firing on all cylinders.  Featuring all the major players from the series reprising their roles (Kiefer Sutherland, Dennis Haysbert, Elisa Cuthbert, etc.) and a storyline and tone and atmosphere that captures the feel of the show, 24: The Game falls apart once you get further into it.  The missions are repetitive, the animation and graphics are jumpy and glitched, and the controls are unresponsive to say the least.  Targeting enemies is a chore at times as you use the analog sticks, but the targeting along with just plain moving gets incredibly cumbersome thanks to a camera that seems to want to work against you.  Some of this could be forgiveable, but the further you get through 24 the more rushed the game feels.  It's a shame too, considering how innovative the series was in it's early life and everything the game had going for it.  If more polish was put into it, 24: The Game could have been something special, but as it is, it's only recommended as a rental for fans of the series
I'll cut to the chase on this one. If you are a fan of Final Fantasy VII, you will look over the shortcomings of this game and find some enjoyment out of it. It has a good story and characters. Its fun to see some of your favorite characters from VII return. But if your not a FF fan, then you won't have much motivation to play this game, and I'm not sure why you would like it. Its very average to mediocre as a action game. Its not horrible by any means, but its just not very good either.  ---  --- Honestly, this game could have just been so much better, in just about every aspect. Gameplay wise, there is nothing unique or interesting about it, and I was just trying to blow through it too get to the next story part. Its also pretty easy and not very challenging. I can't really complain about the environments your fighting through tho, they are well done and some are very well done in my book. ---  --- While the story is easily the strongest part of the game, its not without faults either. It's pacing isn't very good, and some of it doesn't make a whole lot of sense either. But it's kept alive by a strong cast of characters, and some amazing FMV's in typical square fashion. But the story could of been much better as well. I'm not complaining, because it is good and gives you a good backstory of Vincent, but it could of been better if it had been longer. It just feels rushed, and suffers because of that. I finished the game at about 11 hours. If it had been longer and closer to 20 hours they really could of done some special things with the story, and developed the villians more.  ---  --- Bottom line, if your a FF fan, you'll probably enjoy it
The Casio G-Shock Atomic Solar Watch #GW1400DA-4AV is sort of middle of the road in terms of price (I paid $99). It's not cheap but it's not too expensive either. The display diameter is not large but it is a thick, tough-looking watch (a real man's watch... :) ). It's also on the heavy side. So, if you're looking for an elegant, thin watch, look somewhere else. ---  --- When I first got it, the power source was at 50% charge. After leaving the watch on my desk facing up towards a desk fluorescent lamp that was left on, the charge reached 100% the next day. The solar cell seems to be working. The time is accurate too. I checked it against the computer time (which also gets synched everyday). It comes with a small manual (with very small text), but I found that there's really no need to use the manual at all initially. It works right out of the box and all the factory settings were correct. (The manual will come in useful when you have some time on your hands to browse through it to get a clearer idea of all the available features.) ---  --- The watch's steel wristband was much too large for me and I had to shorten it (removed 4 links, actually). I used a Swiss army knife blade to accomplish the task. The knife tip has to be strong enough to apply pressure to the spring loaded rod that holds the links together, but small to get into the small area between the wrist band metal links (watch for the arrows: these tell you where to apply the pressure). You need to push down on the ridges of the rod, and out (away from you). (Down, so that you can make the rod shorter, and out so that when the rod is shortened, the wrist band link will pop out). I did accidentally scratch the band but it wasn't too bad since the scratch was on the inside. (It's easy enough to shorten the wristband and almost everyone who gets this watch will have to do this.) Be careful not to slice your finger open. Always turn the blade away from your finger when applying the pressure. ---  --- Overall, I give it 2 thumbs up for looks and functionality. ---  --- (Note: this watch is sold by multiple vendors on Amazon. You should check for the one that has the best price. When I bought it, I wasn't aware of this but found out later, a little too late)
Let's face it ....... owning a Mac is like owning a Harley or an Airstream. ---  --- It's a cult!!! ---  --- Good fun.  Harmless as can be and it just makes you feel good everytime you sit down at your Mac.  Having a magazine come every month with a bunch of foolishness about this very slick machine increases the joy way more than the magazine price. ---  --- I read it from cover to cover and even believe some of it
I should have bought my girls ipods. ---  --- Yes, these mini-muddles are cute in that they fit into little girl purses and pockets, but that's where the novelty ends. ---  --- First, it is NOT abundantly obvious to children how to work the controls to get where they want to be.  These are kids for crimy sakes!  They needs to have controls that are clear and easy.  My youngest has no idea how to get to a particular song because the buttons never do what she THINKS they should do (That's a big hint to Hasbro...don't design a product from an adults point of view.  Design it for a child from their point of view.  A button having multiple functions is very confusing for kids).  So I end up having to constantly mash those itty-bitty buttons until I can figure out where the song is for her. ---  --- Second, the process of getting music from point A to point B (point B being the mini-black-hole) is NOT a quick and easy process.  Copy here, burn there, transfer to this spot, drag/drop to who knows where.  Oy vey.  And THEN you discover the music isn't in the correct format so you have to start all over again. ---  --- As for the 128 worth of space...128 is a piddly amount of space but it is clearly advertised on the packaging that this is the amount you're going to get.  No surprises there.  Now if I could only get the darn music into the player without giving up and chuckin' it to the dog to play with. ---  --- An ipod might be expensive, but Apple certainly doesn't cause this consumer the grief and frustration that Hasbro has
These books have all been wonderful tools that my son has not only enjoyed very much, but they've helped him make needed improvements with many academic skills. This on encourages reading and it's another great example of a fantastic and useful interactive product
I ordered these Lorna Doone 100 calorie cookies from amazon because they can not keep them on the shelves at any grocery store around my area. I even called a friend 45 miles away and he couldnt find them either. You should try them. They taste great without the extra junk in them.  My kids love them 2 :)
You have not heard his voice until to have heard Andras Schiff play the Well Tempered Clavie
I have multiple cameras, and one of my favorite features is that this reader can support multiple types of cards plugged in at one time.  If you have a SD card and a CF card, both can be inserted and read/written to without having to switch out the cards.  Very nice reader for a great price.   ---  --- The Blue LED is very pleasant to look at.
Insta Sundae in a Can: Simply take the can and squirt some of the stuff into a bowl, cover it in whipped creamand chocolate sauce, put a cherry on top and, voila, you've instantly created a sundae
I received these seat covers as a birthday gift and one of them did rip at the seam (also shortly after they were installed). I came on here to order another and after reading that someone else had the same problem I know not to waste my money. They are very unique and I do like the looks of them but only wish they were better quality
Loved this! It is awesome because it is BOTH land and sea camera, so you need just one! You can get tons of accessories and flashes for it. It is easy to use and the program it comes with allows you to do all kinds of cool corrections INCLUDING making your photos MORE in focus in case you shot them blurry! ---  --- I cannot wait to use it again, well UNDERWATER for diving I mean
I am very pleased with the locket.  It is a nice size, but not too big-definitely large enough to be engraved. The chain is pretty and appears to be strong.  It arrives in a lovely black velvet pouch and box.  My daughter was delighted with it
Homesite is widely recognized as "the" premier tool for coding HTML, client side, and server side code by hand. Adding it to your resume won't land you a job, but it will certainly boost your chances of getting an interview because it indicates that you are not a cheap, WYSIWYG junkie. ---  --- One of the things I like best about Homesite 5 is the adaptability it allows when coding in ASP.NET. I was able to find a plug-in, which when added to Homesite, recognized the .NET tags and colors them accordingly. There are similar plug-ins for just about every language out there. ---  --- If you are unfamiliar with HomeSite, are considering a purchase, but are not sure it's the right tool for you, here's a very brief description on how it works: This is not a drag-and-drop design tool that created the code for you. It is, in essence, a text editor on steroids. As you code BY HAND it will color the code for you, tell you when you've made errors, offer you a ton of help on knowing what tags mean, has a built in FTP client, helps you organize your work into projects, and a bunch of other functions I've never used. ---  --- Here's the main thing you need to know: If you're a HomeSite pro, then you are also a REAL developer. ---  --- To everyone who has whined about lack of support: What do you expect for less then $100? If you purchase a flagship product from Macromedia such as Dreamweaver, Studio MX, or Fireworks, you'll get all the support you'll need. ---  --- Also, I've been able to find PLENTY of FREE support from news groups and email lists that focus on web development. For every problem or question I've found someone who knows the solution. You can too!!! ---  --- Just a note: Amazon is behind the times. From the Macromedia website you can now purchase two versions ahead of what Amazon is offering. ---  --- Well worth the $99.00
This perfume is my absolute favorite!!! It smells so good. I love it! And this roll on is so easy. You can just pack it  in your purse and use it whenever. Its so convenient! But you won't have to really put it on several times day. Once is enough. The scent carries on all day long! I  --- highly recommend this fragrance as a gift to anyone
I bought this thermometer and liked it but after I used it a few times the buttons stopped working and I couldn't turn it off. I opened it to remove the battery and found that it had water in it. A bath thermometer should at least be waterproof
This - along with a pogo stick and stilts - was my effort to get my kids offf the video games at least some of the time! I thought this might be too hard for the 6 year old, but he persisted and is getting better at it. The point is, it's so fun he keeps trying! The 13 yr old - and my 17 year old daughter are enjoying it too. There seems to be a trade-off between the stilts and the hit-a-way. Only the little guy can handle the pogo stick - go figure
Does exactly what it's supposed to.  I don't play guitar that much these days, but this met my needs just fine
Beautiful Watch!! I was already familiar with Invicta and know that they're worth three times the price and that in the future they will be.  Had it in just a few days.  Don't let the picture fool you.  It does not do this piece justice and you would be better off going to another site to view what this watch actually looks like...looks like it cost a whole lot more.  I've been watching Invicta's for about a year now and if you find a better price than this...It's stolen!!!   
These shoes make my feet look so tiny but they are so cute!  I wore them with jeans and will wear them with a pencil skirt next week. Turns out Jessica makes pretty good shoes.........CUTE!!!
Maybe beginning ones were a bad batch? Had mine months now and it works great. Everything it says, it does. No problems  keeping it in the system and did not cause any errors.
The product didn't do what it said it would. I cut the power to use it in my car (I shouldn't have assumed it worked properly) so I couldn't return it and ended wasting $50. I was extremly dissapointed in this product
In two minutes it flucuated over 5 pounds.  Don't waste your money.  The 11$ Sunbeam dial scale is more accurate
While I only own one game for the DS, what makes it so great is the wifi ability to play with friends. I have spent a couple afternoons at a friend's house with several other people, all playing Mario Kart against each other, and it was a fun time full of excitement with people yelling, for either being knocked back from 1st to dead last, or managing to squeeze out the win at the last second. ---  --- The touch screen is also a great addition to the DS. Some games allow either the touch screen or the standard controls to be used, depending on preference. Others, like Mario Kart, stick to the standard controls, and others require the use of just the touch screen, creating a very unique kind of game. ---  --- The Lite is also an improvement of the first DS. While it may not be worth it to upgrade if you already have the first DS, it is worth it if it will be your only DS. The Lite is better shaped, has a better battery life, and better, brighter screens. The DS Lite certainly is a great handheld console
My kids really did learn a lot from this movie, I would recommend it when your child is trying to learn to go on the potty
Fortune is the best business magazine I've ever read.  The articles are insightful and well-written--informative without being dry
What a disaster.  It takes too long.  Then you get a tiny gross little blob of "cotton candy".  It is quite a mess to clean.  Then the kids will cry because it is not at all what they expect and are so disappointed.  My 5 year old wants to know how Santa's elves made such a "stinky, bad toy".  Expect to be disappointed with this one
I am a professional musician. I loved my Grado SR60 so much that when I had a chance to buy a used Grado SR80 I did so. I can't tell a huge difference between the two. The SR60 is a tad more comfortable. I keep one set by my bed to listen to Beethoven quartets late at night. The separation between the instruments is lovely. The quality is wonderful - very smooth and lifelike. I can't imagine a better set of headphones.  --- There is a clear difference between these and my earbuds - although I can lie on my side with my head on the pillow with the earbuds and with the Grado I have to stay on my back. But they are so comfortable I don't mind it. --- The other set of Grado I keep by my rowing machine. I appreciate the long, heavy, indestructible cord. On that set I listen to loud rock and roll or traditional Irish music. It never gets harsh as I turn up the volume and it sounds great. I know there are more expensive cans out there but I doubt the improvement would justify the higher price. --- If you are wondering whether to spring for the higher priced SR80 set, my advice would be to save the $30 and stick with the SR60. I don't feel that the SR80 is much of an improvement. Either earphone is wonderful
This is one of the best dog magazines of all time. The issues just keep getting better and better. This magazine goes beyond purebreds and honors mixed-breeds as well. It has wonderful rescue-related stories. ---  --- One of the other reviewers compared the quality of the articles in this magazine with that of NPR. That comparison really opened my eyes as I have for years enjoyed and appreciated the quality and fairness of the information provided by NPR.
I've had several trimmers over the years and this one is by far the best.  Strong motor, easy adjust, strong vacuum.  Other reviewers commenting on the flimsy guard is kinda suprising to me.  One wouldn't want to push down hard against the face when trimming a beard.... the idea is to glide the unit over your beard... you're not raking, you're trimming! --- Also the unit is easy to clean out after use.  The waste receptacle snaps out easily, as does the cutter head in order to shake out or brush out debris
mustic river is the worst eastwood movie ever well the acting is very good over all but the movie is very boring long and very disturbing it sucks 
I wore this shirt for one day every other week and after five months the collar points have worn through and the white material underneath is showing through. It's a blue shirt so I can't wear it to work now. Unacceptable in a shirt of this price
Finally found this item! I couldn't find this anywhere locally. It is easy for the kids to use and it is easy to clean
I used to love Curious. I asked for it for my birthday and my boyfriend bought me the large bottle with the atomizer and the lotion. However, a few months after I got it, it started to smell funny... over time the atomizer became very hard and had a sticky film all over it. When I opened the bottle I gaged at the stench. I poured it down the sink and it was yellow. I do not recommend buying this product and if you must have this scent please don't buy it with the atomizer. The lotion still smells good.
I purchased this for my daughter since I had already had purchased one for myself.  The pictures are clear and crisp.  If I had to buy another I would purchase the same
The dispencer is easy to "squeeze" amount of moisturizer needed for one application. consistency of moisturizer is easy to apply, it's very mosturizing and on top of that protects agaist UV and aging! very convenient. But just a little bit on the high side for over counter cosmetics for my opinion
Very interesting spoof of the original game.  I found the first one boring after a few plays, but this one still interests my kids and I after 10+ plays.  It's a bit convoluted to put it together initially, but well worth it
Very easy to install; Great tool for easily downloading photos to computer and removing from camera; Would recommend to anybody
After watching Myth Busters use one of these hammers during one of their tests. My father said we should buy a couple of these since we live in an area with quite a few rivers and lakes. The lifehammers appear to be very well made and I fully expect them to do their job if ever needed. The Sheriffs Office just recently pulled a body out of a local river, his jeep had gone off the road and ended up in the river, his girlfriends body was found right away, but it took several months to find his body. If they had had a lifehammer perhaps this accident would have ended better. The LifeHammer is cheap life insurance
This is by far the worst instance of overzealous copy protection I've ever experienced.  I bought this game new at a local store because I've been itching to play SimCity 4 but that game will not work with my new video card.  Got this game home and it installed just fine, but when it came time to launch the game, it said disc authentication failed.  Tried it with the other disc, failed again.  Went to the company's support forums and found a lot of other people with the same problem and no one had done anything to help them.  Thankfully the people at the store were very reasonable and gave me a full refund
If this had been the first album in the "Hip-Hop Hits" series, it would not be a promising start. There are a few decent tunes on here, but as someone who admired the quality of the earlier Source albums, I must express an intense dislike for "Hip Hop Hits Vol.8". There used to be a time when The Source gathered the biggest AND best tracks from the rap indusrty for their compilations, now Benzino has turned the series into a shameless promotion for his own favorites (How else do you explain Ja Rule being here?). Here is a song-by-song analysis of this disaster: --- (1) YoungBloodz feat. Lil Jon  "Damn" C-. This song is perfect example of why people are getting bored with "Sothern Crunk". It's lame and boring, as it shows Lil Jon becoming a one-trick pony. Not a good song to open an album with.        --- (2) Wyclef "The Industry" B. Wyclef is very talented,but this song was never a hit. It should be heard for its quality though, even if it only touchs topics breifly. It is clear that Wyclef is above most of his peers in everyway; sorta like 2Pac.   --- (3) Chingy "Right Thurr" B+. Not my favorite rap song,its better than average though, it kinda grows on you. He reminds me of Juvenile. It's content is not original, but Chingy makes it his own with a relaxed flow and style.  --- (4) Young Gunz "Can't Stop, Won't Stop" C. If this standard work is what Roca-A-Fella has in it's post-Jay-Z future,the label is going to be in real trouble. They're good, but they have to be better than good to stand on their own.   --- (5) Westside Connection feat. Nate Dogg "Gangsta Nation" B+. It was nice to see Westside together again. The style and talent cover up for the somewhat standard material. At the bare minimum, the song is stylistic and very enjoyable.     --- (6) Ja-Rule "Clap Back" D. This anti-Eminem dis is just border line pathetic and lame. Any Eminem song is a bigger hit and better than Ja Rule's weak new stuff. If Ja Rule wants to return to his position "Pain Is Love" brought him to, he must work much harder.      --- (7) Kanye West "Through The Wire" C. Kanye West has enjoyed chart success through alot of hype, but I find this song to be very pedestrian for rap. The lyrics don't define Kanye as an original rapper, and the use Chaka Kahn's "Through The Fire" doesn't make a very appealing beat.    --- (8) Gang Starr "Skills" C. The group isn't that good to begin with, and this song has none of the fun that "Militia" had. Gang Starr has a decent, hardcore sound that needs to be refined in order to define themselves. --- (9) J-Kwon "Tipsy" B-.This song is fun to listen to, but that still does not make it any better than average. It's not really about anything and gets kinda tiresome towards the end; you may be looking at your watch. He's too overpraised.        --- (10) E-40 feat. Clipse "Quarterbackin" C+. The track is enjoyable but was never that popular and is pretty forgetable. E-40 and Clipse just aren't that talented. It almost feels as if it was made strictly for the "Madden Football" video games". --- (11) Fabolous feat. Tamia "Into You" A. Just great, hip hop with style and substance. It's so nice to hear a gentler, more positive hip-hop songs; one that doesn't hammer the listener, but brings out emotions lightly. He is one of the best rappers of 2003; with both his album and it's singles. --- (12) T.I. "Be Easy" C-. He has been compared to Jay-Z and Nelly; despite the difference that he lacks the talent those artists have. Plain, boring, generic rap from an artist who ofers nothing new to the game; no more needs to be said. One must also wonder why this was chosen over his bigger (not exactly better though) hits "Rubber Band Man" and "Let's Get Away".        --- (13) Cassidy feat. R. Kelly "Hotel" B-. A sorta fun track, R. Kelly does as much as possible, but he even he can't make Cassidy sound original. To be honest, this was a huge Top 10 hit though; so it kinda does belong here.  --- (14) Ying Yang Twins feat. Lil' Jon & the East Side Boyz "Salt Shaker" B+. Surprisingly, the beat and production make this song rather entertaining. It's much more fun than it has the right to be; given the non-spectacular artists involved. --- (15) Scarface "Recognize" C-. Scarface used to be an exceptional rapper, but now he's trying to regain glory that is no longer his. Why listen to this, when you could just buy his older albums?       --- (16) The Untouchables featuring Benzino "Relationship With Me & My Gun" C-.Just a standard Benzino track tacked on for shameless self-promotion. I wouldn't mind so much if the songt had actually been worth listening to. Atleast "Bang Ta Dis" on "Vol.5" was a good song.  --- Bottom Line: *1/2. Benzino has ruined the once great Source series in the blink of an eye. If you want to hear a great Source album, buy "Hip Hop Hits Vol.4"; a Source album with the BIGGEST AND BEST raps of 2000. A few good tracks are not enough to balance out all the mediocre ones. To put it in short terms: with so many good compilations out there, why spend money on a bad one? I would not buy this album with a gift card.  
There are all kinds of things that I will eat for health's sake, but my husband is more taste-oriented. There are a lot of energy bars etc that he won't eat, but he loves these
I love the idea behind this game and it's pretty impressively exectuted. I had three gripes though: 1) It's so fast paced that I found it really difficult to progress past the third procedure. 2)I couldn't get the magnify and reduce (with quick little circles) to work.  This caused me great frustration. 3)There's no way to skip through the seemingly endless pages of character dialogue if you have to repeat a procedure a couple of times. --- I quit playing it pretty quickly
Truly a unique spice which used sparingly adds a real zest to meat and poultry dishes.  A wonderful addition to a spice collection. colett
I think this is a great movie about a Guilt stricken IRA gunman. Based on a book this movie will make you laugh,cry,and excited.This is a must
I purchased these slippers in pink, and not only are they super cute, they are quite comfortable and very warm.  The sole of the slipper is slightly heavier than most, but it is nice if you need to step outside or in the garage for something when it's cold out. I would recommend them. :
I stumbled upon this game years ago, and my family has enjoyed it--even my adult friends, who seemed to balk at first at playing a kids' game.  This past year, I decided to purchase it for my sixth grade classroom.  I must say...WOW.  I allowed the kids to play it for a while during homeroom, and kids would be waiting early outside the room to get in and snag the Frog Juice.  They would even play it over other outdoor games at recess.  Anytime you heard a "NOOOO!" in the room, you knew someone had pulled out the Witch Wash.  The kids LOVED it. ---  --- So, I have come back to purchase a new deck for this upcoming year.  To any educators who might be reading this, it makes a great addition to the intermediate classroom for those few minutes of downtime, and because of the math and bit of strategy involved, you don't feel guilty about it at all.  Plus, it is something different and for the teacher, inexpensive as far as games go
I can't believe none of the other reviews of the Ultra Lounge series state that these CD's contain almost all instrumental music, with very few songs that feature vocals.  I expect a lounge music CD to have a mix of both vocal and instrumental tracks, and of the four Ultra Lounge CD's I purchased, I count only three songs with vocals on all four of them.  While the instrumental songs do fit the genre of lounge music, they tend to blend into one another and become mundane after hearing several of them.  The titles of the Ultra Lounge CD's (such as Bachelor Pad or Bossanova) mean very little, as each CD fails to distinguish itself from any other because of all of the instrumental tracks.  The best lounge CD I have heard so far is from an unlikely source.  I purchased it at Pottery Barn, and it has a great mix of vocal and instrumental songs.  Keep this in mind when buying lounge music CD's so that you won't be disappointed the way I was with the Ultra Lounge series
There are so many reviews saying this is a true story I have to point out that while the war and the deployment were real (obviously), about everything else is dramatized (including the mission objectives: SCUD hunting on foot, which is a joke to anyone who knows how wars are fought today). McNab has essentially written Tom Clancy genre fiction. The book Bravo Two Zero differs in details with another book written by a second member of the patrol, Chris Ryan, called The One That Got Away. However, both are convincingly debunked by a third SAS memeber in a book called The Real Bravo Two Zero, also available on Amazon, though only the UK Amazon site (which you can still order from in the US). In it, an SAS member who can actually speak Arabic retraces the patrol using both books as guides and talks to all the people McNab and Ryan supposedly killed and gets their side of the story. Most importantly, he manages to restore, without a doubt, the reputation of Vince Phillips, blamed by Ryan for getting the patrol discovered by the Iraqis and a couple members eventually killed. Contrary to what you may expect, I would recommend seeing this, in fact I recommend getting and comparing all three books: B20, The One That Got Away, and The Real B20
This is a great idea for a great marketing group . . . little kids who want to listen to music "just like the big kids." The FP3 has a few issues of it own, but the speakers were disappointing. The sound quality is not good. Even with the volume turned up it is difficult to hear. Another huge down fall is that a power cord is not available . . . so you can end up going through batteries pretty fast. To top it all off, my son has difficulty getting the FP3 correctly mounted into the speaker unit on his own. Overall we were very disappointed with this accessory
I purchased my Oregon Scientific station 8 years ago.  The internal sensor batteries need changed annually, and I've changed the rechargeables outside once ... I live in Georgia and we get lots of sun.  Other than needing to reset the unit about every 6 months (gets confused by near lightning strikes, but then what wireless electronics don't?) and perhaps not the high precision Rain Gauge I'd like to have, it's more than adequate for any home weather enthusiast
I purchased three of these hearts bracelets for my three daughters for Christmas.  They are very pretty and they loved them.  The quality is good for price.
George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino have got to be two of the worst actors of all time. It's sheer agony to watch these nerds pretend to be macho tough guys. ---  --- This whole flick is akin to getting a gift-wrapped package --- wrapped in the fanciest wrapping paper... Problem is, as is often the case with Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez, ain't nothin' inside the package. Get it? These guys like the worst movies and have managed to become the makers of some of the worst movies ever. The word shallow comes to mind. There is nothing there, and I doubt that there ever will be. ---  --- However, having said that, I must give credit where credit is due: Juliette Lewis, the talented Juliette Lewis, is terrific as usual. Good to see Harvey Keitel do his thing, same goes for Fred Williamson, the rarely seen Michael Parks (this guy, by the way made some terrific country-type records back in the 60's--and we wish he'd do more. He's up there with Merle Haggard  in my humble opinion) and, last but not least, the beautiful Salma Hayek  is also in this, although she hardly does enough. She still had the curves back then. ---  ---  --- In addition to the above, we could have done without all the obvious and crappy CGI effects at the end. The stuff just doesn't work; never did. ---  --- By the way, the documentary FULL -TILT BOOGIE is way --- better than the main feature.
I'm usually not one for taking a chance on new magazines (especially if they've been shoved down the public's throats or Oprah Winfrey endorses it) but this is one instance where Oprah gets major-league credit for putting her faith and money in Rachael Ray. ---  --- I was impressed with the magazine's layout - not too elementary nor too complicated - and the recipes contained within are delicious and easy to prepare (and you won't go searching every speciality shop in the country for the ingredients, either).  I also like how Rachael let readers in on her Italian wedding and African safari honeymoon.  Unlike other celebrities, she didn't let us know too much information (thank you!) and I'm sure her recommendations of trattorias, cafes, and hotels in Tuscany are worth the time and easy on the budget. ---  --- Just because she doesn't have initials besides her name and a culinary degree (she's not the only one on The Food Network lacking this!), Rachael spent her whole life in restaurants and with food and she learned the same tricks of the trade that the fusion chefs on the Network know. ---  --- This is definitely worth a look at and I'm seriously considering ordering a subscription. 
we bought this thinking the suctions would keep the darn thing on - boy were we wrong!  the suction cups are so weak that my cat jumped onto the toilet seat and knocked it over.  save your money
I PLACED A WRONG ORDER AND SO NOW I AM NOT ABLE TO WATCH THE DVD I PURCHASED. IT WAS  FOR AREA NO 1, BUT WE CAN'T WATCH THE NO 1 AREA MOVIES IN TURKEY. --- THEREFORE I DO NOT HAVE A REVIEW 
The adage holds steady with this magazine.  What, to the hip consumer, appears to be a hopeful window into the world of cool turns out to be completely empty.  It would be insulting how hard they try to represent the scene of New York, if it weren't so embarrassing.  Get the village voice.  Try the other coast with Interview.  Just stay away from this disgusting fluff
I've always liked Tevin Campbell, he had a beautiful voice and really did it on "Break it Down". I particularly like Break it Down, Shhh, Brown Eyed Girl among others.. Excellent CD overall. 
When I bought a digital camera, I already knew that I would need rechargeable batteries for it. What I didn't realize was how quickly the camera would eat the supplied alkalines. I had taken barely a dozen pictures before they were drained to the point where the camera would no longer operate! ---  --- So I looked for a set of rechargeable batteries and a charger and quickly settled on this one because of previous experience with Monster Cable's products. ---  --- It performs better than advertised. The initial charge may have taken 3 hours, but subsequent charges have been much quicker. I have yet to drain these batteries to the point where they won't operate the camera. The charger itself is an attractive unit for an appliance, and has an LED indicator that lights up red for charging and changes to green to indicate fully charged. It is compact enough to fit comfortably in the camera bag and the plug folds into the back of it. ---  --- I have had good service from it and can highly recommend this charger
This is one of the best bargains that i've seen, "essentially" you get 3 filters for the price of one.  The image quality with these filters is great, the 812 (warming) filter is by far a favorite giving back the color richness that flash photography so often washes out, that is unless you have the patience for constantly tweaking your flash power.  Aside from the 812 the UV protector is basically a clear protective filter.  While it obviously has advantages over clear glass, I tend not to think of it as any different.  This too is a great filter which I use about half the time because it doesn't affect color hues or change f stop values too greatly while it takes the worry out of carrying the camera around ready for any candid shots that may occur.  Finally included is the circular polarizer. This filter adjusts the amount of uv light entering the camera by spinning the filter to the direction the uv rays are entering (or turning the thingy till things look better). This lens is great for sunny days and will take surface glare off lakes and glass making them transparent again.  It also makes colors more crisp in general when photographing buildings and other large "reflective" man-made things. So things sound great so far, but now to why I only give this item 4 stars.  While Tiffen is known to be one of the best at photo and video filters, they have quality control issues that do no live up to thier reputation.  In my case the 812 filter arrived with a discoloration in the glass.  While it was didn't hurt image quality, with the flaw being towards the edge of the filter, I none the less didn't want to find a situation in which the flaw would diminish quality.  Seeing as it was not amazon's fault my first e-mail went to Tiffen for a replacement which they said they would gladly do, but only after I send them the filter and they recieve it would they ship my replacement (not an option in my circumstances).  Instead Amazon's wonderful customer service shown through again, and within 3 days they had replaced the entire set.  The second set arrivided without flaw but since my other two filters were in perfect condition I traded just the 812.  I havn't had any other issues and i'm very satisfied with my filters. The only other word of warning would be to that of the circular polorizer. While I recieved 2 that were flawless occassionally I have read in reviews customers have received ones that were assembled backwards making the lens useless. A quick way to check to see if your CP is working correctly is to hold it, thread facing yourself, and look at an LCD monitor or TV and spin it until the picture dissapears(obviously working correctly). I still wouldn't pass up this deal knowing what I do now, chances are everything will show up perfectly but none the less if you're concerned order it before you need it and check everything over carefully. Amazon is always the best for returns and will often ship a replacement the next day with overnight shipping
I got this sd400 to replace my s400 which after a year started giving me a memory card error message. I now find out that was a design flaw. Anyway, i spent hundreds of dollars on this one, and now, just over a year after I got it, it won't hold a battery charge. I loved both cameras while they worked, but I can't afford a $400 camera plus the related accessories every year or so. I've written to Canon tech support. Unless they are willing to repair or replace this one free of charge, I'm moving on to another brand camera
Seriously, went into the store to find new running shoes, possibly the air 360.  Was wearing shoxs in the store.  Threw them away immediately.  These are the best shoes I've worn in a long while.  I'm one of those ppl that like to take off my shoes as soon as I get home.  I forgot that these were on, they were that comfortable.  I'm a heavy, parttime runner.  Nothing over 5K as I am just starting again.  They support my weight extremely well
Americans who can't name five poets will name Allen Ginsberg.  In this case, that is good since he was one of America's Greatest Poets.  This book attest to this. ---   I write this review to show disappointment in the publisher who continues to publish the collected works on the cheapest paper next to newsprint.   ---   For the next edition, I would like to see, at least in limited edition, a volume printed on quality paper which could last more than a few years before turning yellow. ---   Ginsbergs deserves better treatment
I'm still waiting for Poldark to make it across the pond. Until then, I'll satisfy myself with this fine work
This is the first product I've bought through Amazon that I wish I could give a negative star rating.  After involving three adults and spending about 3 hours troubleshooting, I've concluded this product **** DOES NOT *** work.  Customer service cites this is a "product upgrade".  A video shows cable wrapping around pole and unleashing with sufficient velocity to hit.  What we received was a cable of similar rigidity to what you would lock your bike up with or tow a small vehicle.  It would barely even unwrap.  Imagine Derek Jeter in the photo trying to hit the ball three inches from the pole at 1.5 miles per hour and you can begin to understand this product upgrade. 
I agree with the reviewer who said this work is boring. It seems Roth is trying to glorify Philip Roth and not the characters. He goes on and on describing the overwhelming feelings zuckermann has for "the swede", without letting us know who the Swede really is. Roth should let the characters tell the story or try to use less erudition in his narration. --- It gets to the point where the reader loses interest in finishing the book. I loved the plot against american because it was more character based than philosophizing about about the historical context of the times
Stretchy, comfortable and made well- love this T-shirt! (Also its a slim fit and not really, really long like many are right now- more of upper hip length, which is great if you want to tuck it in!
I had the Tokina 12-24 f4 and it was a great sharp lens. This Canon focuses faster and is wider. If you're worried about full frame in the future don't be. Just buy this lens and enjoy the ultra wide images. It light, fast and sharp. "L" quality pictures. The build could be better but I don't see any problems down the road.
I was so happy in receiving the watch so fast.They do good business
Pros: Cheap ---  --- Cons: Bad video quality. Moving diagonal lines are clearly visible
La instalación del producto fue bastante simple, la configuracion y operacion tambien los son, solo he observado un problema con el control remoto, en ocasiones deja de funcionar, no controla el volumen ni cambia los caneles de cable, solo despues de oprimir el boton de apagado y luego de vilver a activarlo es que regresa la funcionalidad de los botones de control de volumen y selector de canales; otra observacion en el funcionamiento es que al seleccionar en forma progresiva canales estos saltan al siguiente
I love the storage bag. It was large enough for my 7 1/2ft. tree. I haven't had any problems with it. It's sturdy. I didn't like the fact that the shipping and handling is almost as much as the storage bag
Es una docena de uñas asi como cualquiera, vienen como en talco para comodidad. Son duraderas y bueno el resto depende del guitarrista. ---  --- Si tocas baladas y pangoladas, no es conveniente tener uñas tan gruesas para charrasqueo. En cambio la onda en que estoy de heavy lo hacen necesario por el desgaste en los riff. ---  --- Saludo
Great for if you are not near a computer and need to charge your Ipo
Product shipped quickly and was well packaged. Each loop or hole on the edge has an individual string that you have to tread. Would have been better if the strings were attached to the netting. Overall, the product works very well and gave us the protection for our child we were looking for. Our 22 month old tested it contiually by pushing hard and running into it and there were no problems
This is worthless and they say it's refundable, until you read the fine print and realize it's only if you bought the entire product line. It is crap and doesn't do anything. Don't waste your money, drink milk and your hair will grow. This does not work
I have been a fan of Sue Henry since her first Jessie Arnold mystery.  I was looking forward to reading her lastest adventure, but was very disappointed in this outing.  The characters were one-dimensional.  After discovering who the "bad guys" were I needed to reread part of the book for clarification.  Sue Henry has a very annoying habit of foreshadowing at the end of many of her chapters.  "...they hadn't a notion just how decidedly things could - and would - change in the next few hours."  Even the relationship between Alex and Jessie seemed stilted.  I realize it is difficult to create plausible mysteries for a civilian like musher Jessie Arnold, but this book tried too hard and accomplished too little
I have been searching reviews of the Nikon coolpix s7c to make sure that it wasnt just me - and I am finding that indeed countless other reviewers are having the same problem, and many have taken it up with Nikon only to be told 'sorry'. ---  --- In a nutshell, I am a professional photographer and have owned about a dozen digital cameras ranging from the early elph to nice new SLR models.  I purchased the Nikon coolpix s7c for my wife, and it is by far the worst one I have owned for many reasons, but the chief problem is they have simply screwed up the way this camera does things automatically and the result is HORRIBLE PICTURES.  ---  --- The 'electronic VR' is simply digital image sharpening, the ISO adjustments in low light are terrible, and what I simply cannot believe is how terrible the autofocus is.  Couple that with the design of this camera that makes it difficult to shoot steadily, and you literally end up getting more than 50% blurry pictures
Daughter plays it all the time.  Pretty Quick shipping.  Brand new.  Excellent seller
We got this as an 11th birthday present for one of my daughter's friends.  It was the hit of the birthday party -- all the girls went home with new yarn belts, and my daughter, who can already knit a little, asked if she could have one, too.  The colors of yarn are bright and the texture is easy to work with.  For our purposes, this was a great birthday present
I'll let others argue whether or not the quality of the magazine has subsided over the years. I, for one, still get something out of  the writing. Can't do without my monthly dose of Harper's and The Atlantic. ---  --- What I would like to point out is that why would you buy here when the subscriptions cost less on A.M.'s own website
I have been a long time user of Delorme Products but decided to get a combination of Microsoft products both for the US and Europe (Autotrip).  ---  --- The program loaded very smoothly, but do make sure you load the program before plugging in the GPS Locator.  There are multiple warnings about this as well as what to do if you don't follow directions.  I loaded all the data on my laptop so I would not have to carry the DVD.   ---  --- The setup was also quite simple.  There are warnings about usage in an automobile that pop up in use (as well as the cautions during setup).  One needs to keep this in mind and not be distracted when driving.  I set the mapping program and forget it.  But it works best with two people in the car with one to navigate. ---  --- The GPS locator has a great chipset.  Very, very sensitive and quickly finds the coordinates within seconds, even as I sit in my house.  It rarely loses a lock on the satellite.   ---  --- The route finding works well, so far.  You can save your track as well as the route, but unlike the Delorme products you can't playback your track (or if you can, I have not found it).  The screen is pleasing and you go fullscreen.   ---  --- I haven't tried voice recognition but the spoken commands are about average.  The ability ot overlay satellite photographs when planning routes with an internet connection is a plus.  Plus you can routinely update road construction sites.  So far, no opinion on how good that feature is.   ---  --- The Microsoft location finder internet leaves something to be desired though I've only tried it at home.  It routinely thinks I'm in China (which is interesting because so many ads are quite able to figure out where I am).   ---  --- The GPS also works with other programs by selecting a generic NEMA GPS.  There are other optional equipment to go with the GPS.   ---  --- If you've never used a GPS mapping program with a laptop, Microsoft S&T is a good choice.  Just don't be surprised if the GPS lcates you accurately and the Microsoft locator product puts you on the other side of the planet.
This is probably one of Casio's least expensive Wave Ceptors. It synchs every day indoors in a watch case that's not by a window. The digital display shows the day, date, and other info such as which time zone, what time it synched. I'm just concerned that the analog, digital display, and receiving every day will make it a battery eater. It's available in different dials, but the blue seems to be the most common. I give it 4 stars because the luminous paint is not very bright. And the crystal is acrylic-scratches easily. But that's not really an issue because I have about 15 watches, and this one gets very little wrist time
It's an understatement that many of us feel ripped off by WB's attempt to unfairly empty our wallets. If we refuse to buy these horribly priced episode dvds and at the same time purchase the available full season box sets that are of value then we can make some headway. They are in the business of making $$$. Slowing their cash flow will force them to give us consumers' products we demand or risk losing our disposable income. Die-hard fans of this series and other series must convince every parent to withhold from purchasing these dvds until full seasons are made available. C'mon WB, we love these shows and will pay for them. We only ask that you don't rape our wallets. Give us the full season box sets much sooner
Poor workmanship. Padded handgrip area varied from 3.25 to 3.5" long. Most palms are wider than that. The cheap construction looks like it will fail within a short period of use.  Shipping them back would cost more than they're worth.
Be warned, if you have a computer with a slot dvd drive, you simply cannot transfer your video files to your computer for editing, sharing, whatever.  Can't be done without a series of possibly mythical workarounds and loss of quality with each step.  I was even willing to consider buying an external dvd drive with a firewire connection and a loading tray that supported the 8 cm disks, but couldn't find one.  I searched all over, asked in several places on the apple web boards, talked to the 'geniuses' at the Apple store - this camera is simply not usable with a macintosh that has a slot drive.  Talk about crazy! 
This magazine is the best there is.  There is page after page of beautiful designs and excellent instructions.  I have bought some books that don't have as many beautiful knitting projects in them as one issue of this magazine
Calvin Klein provides a fashionable, comfortable underwear. Tight but not too tight, it holds you in place, while not constricting you to a tight position. Excellent, but don't buy them too little
I am new to the world of gourmet salts--and this jar of flakey white granules has been in great demand in my house since we received a few weeks ago!  The granules are the size of the salt on a hot pretzel--but that is where the similiarities end.  The salt dissolves instantly on the tongue; it has no bitter or cloying aftertaste.  The jar suggests it be used  on grilled fish and salads, but I would reccomend it in lieu of table salt also. 
To be quite honest, although there was a stunning cast, the plot was gory. It was sweet and had it's element of romance, but it was too morbid for me to enjoy. If you are watching for Drew Barrymore, don't bother. she only  appears halfway through the movie and then only sporadically afterwards.  Dean Cain on the other hand looks mighty fine, if you're after a gay man.  It's not the type of movie you want your children to watch. Trust me
He estado disfrutando de este tv por alredeor de 5 dias, la imagen es muy buena, facil de instalar, lo unico que se deberia mejorar es el sonido. 
Good modeling tool with great 3-D graphics which allows the user to view from any direction. The component selection is adequate and the tutorial was informative allowing me to get started designing within the first hour of installing the product
As a mother of 5, this toy has proven to be one of my favorites of all time.  My son received it for Christmas (at age 2 months) and it has been wonderful.  We place it in his bed at naps and at night, and he goes to sleep watching and listening to it.  When he wakes up, it is there for him to play with.  As he has grown (he is now 7 months), he has become increasingly more interested in the sounds and textures of the toy, and now puts the corners in his mouth which has helped with teething.  I have been impressed with the sound quality (it is not annoying like most musical children's toys) and I will be anxious to see if it causes my son to love music on a different level.  LOVE THIS TOY!
Shipping was fast and cherries were great.The best dried cherries we have bought
I was really excited for this! I hoped it would be a faster, easier way to do make up and what not, but its not. --- It smears like crazy, and the end is so sharp, it hurts to apply. But that doesn't matter! --- the end stops working after a use or two. --- I suppose if you wanted to do make up similar to a raccoon with blueish eyes (for the black is more navy then black) you'll be happy. --- I've always loved the mark products, but this is a disappointment
Great book ....my partners therapist recommended it for him to read  --- It Helps you to understand & deal with the problems --- Easy to read & understand
  I bought this for my 4month old for Christmas, I liked the pretty, bright colors and the sounds the foot pad would make.. she was a little small when I put her in, but nothing a thin blanket tucked around her for support wouldn't fix, and a pillow under her feet.  She wasn't heavy enough yet to push the foot pad to make noise, all of those things she would grow into though.  The part I couldn't over look though is how close all the toys were to her head and how hard the toys were.  She tried to chew on the see-saw (teething, everything goes to the mouth) and it was too hard and hurt her gums so crying she jerked her head back and bumped it on the mirror behind her.  It was a pitiful sight. Poor baby. I don't know why they didn't allow just a little more tray space  and curved that silly bar out more so they wouldn't bump their heads.  I think a little more thought put into the product and it could be a great toy, but as it is now I think it's just a little too "rough around the edges".  I took mine back to the store and then bought an Evenflo, she fits in it much better and so far she LOVES it.
My husband and I purchased this warmer with gift cards we received for our second baby's birth.  We don't really like it.  Our wipes dry out down to about the third, sometimes fourth wipe.  That's makes for a 6-8 wipe diaper change!  (that's a lot of wasted money) Other reviewers are right about the wipes staying moist when it is not as full.  But with a newborn, infant or even a toddler I prefer the convenience of opening a refill pack and placing all of the wipes into the warmer instead of half the wipes in and then finding something to keep the second half moist until it's time to refill with the other half.  We had a wrap-around warmer with our first child.  It wore out around the time we started potty training her.  That's the style of wipe warmer I would recommend for new parents, not this one
I used to listen to a friend's copy of the original "Metal Box" of EP's, when it first came out. ---  --- Years later the "Second Edition" came out on LP's for those of us who hadn't sprung for the Metal Box before it sold out. ---  --- Eventually the Second Edition came out on this CD. So I finally could own a digital copy myself. Pristine, audio quality at least as good as the original Metal Box in my opinion, if I remember correctly. ---  --- You do need to listen to this. You do need to buy a copy and get other people to listen to this too
I can not believe that Helen Gurley Brown would let them make this farce based on her book. Now let see if we can straiten the out before it gets confused. ---  --- Sylvia and Frank Broderick (Lauren Bacall and Henry Fonda) are a couple in live that are always bickering as to if Frank has a roving eye. --- Helen Gurley Brown (Natalie Wood) writes her famous book.  --- Bob Weston working for an unscrupulous magazine is tasked with getting the good on Helen. He uses Frank's and Sylvia's problems pretending he is frank to accomplish the mission. ---  --- Throw in another physiologist a few women some tickets to Figgie and Florida. A lot of misconceptions and one of the best carmaker cycle, ice cream truck, cab, and etc. scenes ever made.  ---  --- Will it all work out in the end? --- Will it ever end? ---  --- They try real hard to make it campy and use intentionally exaggerated acting. For some reason it works.
Is there anyone out there (women included) who didn't develop a crush on the interminably cute Lori Loughlin after watching the 1985 film The New Kids?  Probably, but for me, it was different (yeah, that's what they all say)...Lori Loughlin looked so very much like a girl in my neighborhood, whom I also had a crush on, back when I was in my teenage years...seems to me crushes were a dime a dozen back then, as were broken hearts, but I digress (as usual).  Co-written by Stephen Gyllenhaal (father of actors Maggie and Jake) and Brian Taggert (Visiting Hours, Wanted: Dead or Alive), and directed by Sean S. Cunningham (Friday the 13th, DeepStar Six), the film features Shannon Presby ("Five Mile Creek"), Lori Loughlin (Amityville 3-D, Secret Admirer), and James Spader (Pretty in Pink, Less Than Zero, Stargate).  Also appearing is Eric Stoltz (The Wild Life, Mask, The Fly II), Eddie Jones (C.H.U.D., Invasion U.S.A.), John Philbin (The Return of the Living Dead, Point Break), Vince Grant (Timequest), Paige Lyn Price (All the Right Moves), and Tom Atkins (Halloween III: Season of the Witch, Creepshow). ---  --- Loren (Presby) and Abby (Loughlin) McWilliams are teenaged siblings who face a difficult task of moving on after the untimely deaths of their parents.  Shortly after their parents are laid to rest, Uncle Charlie (Jones) shows up and offers to take the pair in, to which Loren and Abby accept and move to a jerkwater town in Florida.  On arriving they discover Uncle Charlie has just purchased a dilapidated amusement park called Santa's Funland, to which he plans on fixing up and making his fortune.  As kids begin to settle into their new lives, Abby finds some of the local boys have taken a shine to her, particularly that of Dutra (Spader), the creepy, wild eyed, albino leader of loose knit gang of rednecks whose hobbies include dogfights, shooting guns, using and selling drugs, and betting on who can nail the new girl...smooth move Dutra makes his play, but Abby, sensing what an obvious sleaze ball the guy really is, turns him down.  Well, Dutra doesn't accept rejection well, and he and his boys participate in a little vengeful vandalism and property damage.  Loren fights back, pretty effectively too, but Dutra isn't the type to let things go being all insane and such, and matters escalate to the point where Dutra and his cronies kidnap Abby during the big dance for a little after party get together...Abby manages to escape (with a few well placed groin kicks), but Dutra knows where she's going, and heads her off at the pass (the `pass' being the amusement park).  Soon enough Loren makes the scene and now the siblings find themselves running for their lives through the theme park, hunted by liquored up, drug-addled hillbillies sporting shotguns, vicious tempers, and murderous intent.  ---  --- I enjoyed this movie specifically for the fact it didn't try to be more than it was, which is a really well done, exploitive B film.  Yeah, I suppose having Lori Loughlin in it didn't hurt its chances with me, but since Ms. Loughlin refuses to return my calls or participate personally in my romantic visions of whimsy (have I somehow overestimated my animal magnetism?), any bias leanings I would have normally felt towards the film, or any of the projects she appears in, have leveled off since...the real highlight here, for me at least, is James Spader as Eddie Dutra, king sleaze in a group where that's one hell of an accomplishment.  Picture his character from Pretty in Pink, only with less money and a whole lot meaner...and ruthless...and violent...and with an odd southern drawl...and an albino.  Love that custom maroon boogie van he drives around in...it's always interesting to see someone still perpetrating a fad that long since seen its day, even in 1985 (`vanners' saw their heyday in the late 70s, despite the protest of a few of the more dedicated members).  He was just so slimy, so vile, so despicable, and so entertaining.  Look for the scene when Loren sneaks into Dutra's room in the middle of the night to collect on a debt.  The décor of Dutra's room speaks volumes towards his character, a great example of fleshing out a character without wasting a lot of screen time.  There were some interesting characters in his little band of hoodlum rejects, but Dutra was, without a doubt, calling the shots.  Another aspect I liked was the fact that the characters of Loren and Abby weren't weakling types normally prone to victimization, but strong characters that stood up for themselves, even despite facing greater odds.  This was obviously a quality they got from their father (played by Atkins), who we saw a bit of near the beginning of the film.  The dialog works, as does the acting (for the most part), and the location shots are excellent.  Cunningham keeps the story moving along well, priming the audience for what they know is coming, in that of a final showdown, and what a confrontation it is...what makes the film so much fun, especially towards the end, is that the villains are so absolutely and completely rotten that when they do get their comeuppance, you can't help but let out a fulfilled cheer, much like I do when Chuck Bronson blasts a cap into a worthless punk in one of those Death Wish movies.  A couple of memorable sequences is when Loren rigs the Ferris wheel and takes Moonie for a ride (Dutra had planted Moonie on top of the Ferris wheel with a rifle), and when Loren is fighting with Gideon (Philbin) near the roller coaster...this scene gave new meaning to the phrase `a little off the top'...you have to see the film to understand the full extent of that comment.  And watch Abby get jiggy with a two by four...few things can get your point across like a good piece of lumber upside someone's head.  All in all this is a great little film, worth at least a rental if you enjoy the seedy side of cinema, and don't mind a little blood along with perceived violence towards animals (I do think the lopping of the chicken head was real), followed by a slightly predictable ending which I didn't see coming, but enjoyed nonetheless. ---  --- The quality of the picture, presented in anamorphic widescreen (1.85:1), looks excellent, and the Dolby Digital Stereo comes through very well.  There aren't really any special features, but there are some unrelated trailers for other Columbia Tristar Home Video releases like Frankenfish (2004), Devour (2005), Vampires: The Turning (2005), and Kingdom Hospital (2004). ---  --- Cookieman108 ---  --- If I learned anything from this film it's that dousing a woman with lighter fluid and then threatening to set her on fire does not make her more accepting towards intimate relations...
the price for the slippers was average- no big discount, but they arrived at my front door in time for Christmas. That was a big plus. And my daughter loved them
The bag is suppose to hold two cameras,I have a rebel and two lens and cant fit them in with lens filters and extra batteries. I recomend you buy a bigger bag it does not meet the billing here. might be good for a couple of point and shoot cameras but not SL
I've had car chargers before, for other cell phones, and never experienced any problems. I was attracted to this one by the low cost, but I guess you get what you pay for. It lasted for about two uses and then quit altogether.
I started with Norton Ghost 2003 many years ago and had problems backing up clone images.  Acronis True Image Backup 9.0 has a simple user interface that works well.  I used it to re-image my son's computer without any problems.  It is a good product for the price.  I highly recommend making a backup image of your hard drive on a weekly basis
The product is very nice. It blows up a tire within just a few minutes. The only bad thing is the cord that goes from the cigarette lighter to the tire isn't quite lone enough. It is great for cars, but it won't reach my back tires on my truck
I ordered both this and Honey Nut version.  I wish I had paid more attention to the Low Fat part of this version.  This version is hard and too cinnamon/sugary which seems to happen w/ some low-fat cereals.  They compensate for the low fat by sugaring it up and end up w/ a hard less tasty and less filling product.  However, the Honey Nut version is very good.  It has good crunch, but is not too hard and has tasty almond slivers in it.  It's sweet, but not overly for granola, and no cinnamon taste at all.  I understand many products w/ raisins add cinnamon and I typically like cinnamon, but this version is too much and the raisins too dried out and hard.  The package is very convenient though. ---  --- I now have to mix in the regular version w/ this product to help me get rid of the Low Fat stuff. ---  --- Some label info:  Low Fat w/ Raisin (LF) has 180 calories per 1/2 cup while Honey Nut (HN) has only 20 more at 200.  There are 12 1/2 cup servings in the HN while the LF only has 10.  Product weight is HN 24 oz and LF 20.5 oz.  Finally sugars are HN 11g while the LF has 15g
After reading all the connection problems with wireless IP cameras , I decided to purchase the wired ver. (BL-C10A panasonic). I was very pleased with the easy setup and dns service included for the camera . I currently use this camera in a cabin , so I can look in and see the temp. inside and look around. This is simpe remote monitoring , as hookup took less than 1.hr to get up and running. I do not use the emailing feature presently . --- Pros : simple to setup and get running over internet ---        price is reasonable ---        images are the best for a camera this cheap ---        using viewnet  (dns service) very easy   --- Cons : wired to the router  ---        no included light leds (but at this price) ---        must use timer to reset ip camera (cheap house timer every 24hrs
The Schwinn Airdyne is built to last out of steel. For upper and lower body workout, it uses a fan/flywheel to create resistance rather than a friction belt or magnetic motor; hint--fewer repairs and failures since there is no friction mechanism to fail. ---  --- The onboard computer allows your to select what information you wish to see such as mets, calories, distance, speed, rpm and even displays your pulse if you wear a chest strap.  You can select miles or kilometers for distance and "club or home" for setup; hint--built to withstand use in a fitness center/health club. It even allows you to imput your geological elevation to facilitate a more accurate calorie count. ---  --- Assembly is straight foward but does require a few basic tools such an adjustable wrench and phillips screwdriver. ---  --- This represents a good way to go if you want a well built durable piece of equipment intended for serious use to achieve your goal of cardio-vascular conditioning, weight loss or just plain old exercise
Very happy with our camera! Perfect condition and quick arrival
It's hard to do better than a Weber and this grill has not disappointed in the two years I have owned it.  I use it 3-4 times a week and have cooked just about everything you can imagine on it.  I am very satisfied with its performance, but it has a few minor flaws.  I still have my Genesis series propane grill that is still fine after 12 years, but it was not big enough so I moved up. ---  --- Pros: --- Stainless doesn't rust. --- Large enough to cook a substantial amount using indirect method.  Last night, I simultaneously grilled 4 T-Bones, 10 skewers of tequila-lime shrimp, sweet peppers, and bread.  That's why I wanted this grill.  I need room to cook. --- Insulated box holds the heat well. --- First side burner I've had that actually works. --- Assembly was relatively easy. --- Strong rotisserie motor.  Spin a turkey or 3 chickens; no problem. --- The smoker box w/ its own burner is a great feature. --- Stainless grates are better than any others I have used in past. --- Lots of shelf space w/ fold-down shelves. --- Battery-fired push button starters for all burners is easy and reliable in all weather conditions. ---  --- Cons: --- Expensive.  But I do expect a long service life. --- Gas guzzler.  More than one tank is helpful. --- Couldn't find a cover that fits it.  But it is stainless... --- Gas gauge doesn't work that well, but no biggie. --- The bottom of the cookbox has warped a little resulting in the grates being loose and shifting more than I'd like.  On occasion when cleaning the grates, they will fall into the bottom of the cookbox.  I can work around this and probably fix it without too much trouble, but it does tick me off.  This cost them my 5th star; I expected better. ---  --- So I pretty much love this grill and it's a good thing, because I believe I'll have it for a good long while. ---  --- Chad, the weird chain on the door is for manually lighting the grill.  It is a match holder on a chain attached to the door so you won't lose it.  Go figure
First time I've ever written a review.  I'm not a high tech type, and sometimes it's nothing but frustration for me to deal with high tech stuff.  This remote was a breeze to program, and works fantastic.  My wife and daughter are even less high tech and love it.  Any problems with use, just press "help" and the remote with ask you questions and correct the problem.  Highly recommended
I love chocolate --- I love dark chocolate, especially for my drinking chocolate. --- I should have been suspicious when on the label it says you can make pudding from this as well...which should have alerted me right off the bat that there are other ingredients in the tin--not just chocolate and some sugar...it must be cornstarch. ---  --- Marie Belle makes a big deal of the fact that this is NOT cocoa, but cacao...that's why I fell for the hype...but in the end, it's the flavor that counts, and this one...I guess because of the corn starch...has a strange "mouth feel" and flavor that I find unpleasant. ---  --- I find the French brand  L'Ancienne  far superior...and my favorite drinking chocolate is  --- Charbonnell et Walker, which is not for sale (yet) on Amazon
The game of course is great fun, but the 3-D is not worth the extra cost.  The kids get distracted by the slides and ladders and don't play the game.  They fight over which direction the marble should move (and of course marbles get lost easily).  How to count the spaces is not obvious.  I would just get the good old classic game if I had it to buy over again. 
Having this variety of colors makes working on posters much better. These are also good for writing on white t-shirts
I visit England frequently.  I have an earlier edition of this book which I find to be very useful, even now.  The new version leaves out a lot of the good places that were in the old book and it lacks credibility.  I have a hard time taking any of it seriously when it tells me that an English pint is 16 ounces.  Anyone who is serious about English beer knows that an English pint is 20 ounces
The literature of September 11 is never attacked.  When a book speaks of September 11 (or of terrorism in general), it is more or less guaranteed immunity from criticism; it will almost inescapably be greeted with sympathy.  Jonathan Safran Foer's EXTREMELY LOUD AND INCREDIBLY CLOSE banks on such sympathy, on such reverence.  The narrative, which concerns a nine-year-old boy named Oskar Schell in search of a key that would unlock / unshell the enigma of his dead father (a narrative stolen, in its basic outline, from Guenther Grass's DIE BLECHTROMMEL), could have been written entirely without its scattered references to the terrorist interventions.  Nor is this trauma the only one presented in the novel: the others include Hiroshima / Nagasaki, the Staten Island Ferry crash, and the Dresden bombings.  Each disaster is generalized to the point at which what is addressed is not a traumatizing event in its specificity, but historical "trauma" itself and the overcoming of trauma through bereavement-inspired creation.  Oskar, the insufferable brat, attempts to complete the work of mourning for his father, Thomas Schell, Jr., a victim of September 11, by compiling an almanac of self-inflicted wounds, the collage of images and letters which is the book we are "reading"---an almanac which, most likely, is written sometime in the indefinite future (Thomas Shell, Sr.'s manuscript of 4/12/78 is heavily edited (pp. 208-216).  Who has done the editing?  Almost certainly an older version of his grandson Oskar).  If the term, "reading" even applies.  Whenever a "pregnant" image is described, Foer literally re-presents it in the form of a pictorial image.  When a flock of birds rises into the sky, it is not enough that we read of these birds---we must see them as well.  Words may not be left in their invisibility; we are presented with supplementary photographs, illustrations, since mere verbality is not enough.  (Indeed, the entire novel oozes with misologos --- the mistrust or hatred of language --- in terms of both its content and its form.)  Photographs, yes, and also a superabundance of blank pages and nearly blank pages.  Space is not used in the manner it is in the works of Edmond Jabes, for instance.  Typography does not substitute for a well-wrought sentence.  Foer abrogates himself of all responsibilities --- most specifically, the responsibility to write well.  Why bother when the pyrotechnics of typography are at his disposal?  As far as the writing is concerned, it is composed of nothing other than mind-numbingly, soul-deadeningly repetitive phrases ("heavy boots," "raison d'etre," etc.) and Sunday school platitudes: "Sometimes one simply wants to disappear" (184); "There's nothing wrong with not understanding yourself" (184); "Everything that's born has to die, which means our lives are like skyscrapers" (245); "How can you say I love you to someone you love?...  It's always necessary" (314).  Whenever the author writes something that he finds "beautiful" and "true" (165), he congratulates himself on his brilliance and tells us that that thing is "beautiful" and "true."  The entire book reeks of such unearned profundity.  We also learn that most dust is made up of human detritus---a very deep truth indeed, one that Foer also communicates in his essay, "Emptiness" (originally published in PLAYBOY) with all of the sanctimoniousness and self-righteousness of the faux naif who serves as the center of the novel, a Sunday school lecture in which we learn that famous musicians (Ringo Star) and scientists (Stephen Hawking) are unthreateningly approachable: everything is familiarized.  Perhaps it is wrong to criticize Foer for including so many blank pages in EXTREMELY LOUD AND INCREDIBLY CLOSE, since the entire book is a vacuum: null space into which readers may project their own meanings. ---  --- Joseph Suglia, Ph.D., the author of WATCH OUT
I bought my first set of five sheets days ago, with no real idea with what i wanted to use it for. Just tonight I decided to spruce up my backpack for school using various images. It was very easy, and the results are amazing! I strongly suggest that everybody try it out, it really brought a new, more glamourous life to that old backpack!
My sister said her 3yo son loved and and was able to play in it with his 1yo brother! I don't really know how durable it is, she lives in another state but said they liked it alot
Are you kidding me?  We're going to set up an EarGel Xchange?  Will this be domestic, the Americas or are we going Enter-Gnashin-All with this PUPPY?!? ---  --- Ok, I'll do the web site, we're going to need some fat pipe to handle the bandwidth for this one.  Anyone know a Fortune 500 CEO we can bring into the picture?  Distribution is going to be biggest problem here, I'm thinking we don't give UPS a look, let's hit up DHL with an agreement they expand into territories when volume dictates.  It's gamble, but if we can drive down the shipping cost it should keep those 'Johnny Gels come lately' from jumping into arena. ---  --- I'll go ahead and have a talk with some of the other players in the community, I've got a 5 year no-compete signed with Craigs List but eBay is busting my b???s over this, they want 9% of the gross ad revenue from www.UnlovedEarGels.com but after we secure the venture capital I'll tell those jokers to take a hike. ---  --- Allright, let's get this thing moving folks great ideas have a shelf-life and the clock is ticking
This mat is a good bargain and perfect for the casual pilates partaker like myself. Rolls up nicely and the velcro should strap makes it easy to transport or store away. Good thickness and provides just enough cushioning so you can't feel the floor beneathe you. Easy to wipe down and keep clean
 At a recent NYE event, I shot a lot of photos in a concert setting without a flash and am very impressed with the sharpness & clarity of this lens performance. Its so fast and the colors are vibrant. I am not a seasoned pro but with the 20D and this lens, it makes me look pretty close. I did shoot in manual and once I got my aperture & shutter speed dialed in, it pumped out a lot of great pics. ---  I have also shot some pics of waterfalls (slowing down my shutter speed to get that soft flowing image) and portraits of people and again, it oozed excellence. The 135mm focal range is not as convenient as a zoom, but the quality of this prime lens makes up for any incovenience
I'm a huge fan of the majority of the Philosophy line, along with adoring the Amazing Grace scent!  I thought this scrub would be perfect for the spring into summer period because of the light floral scent.  Boy was I wrong!!   --- If you love amazing grace, this smells Nothing like it.  IT smells like plastic flowers.. not appealing at all.  Even my fiance made a comment that the bathroom smelled like melting plastic.  If you want a fantastic exfoliator, try Gingerbread Man or the Margarita scrub.. those are devine!  I think I'll stick to my amazing grace body lotion from now on
My son got this for his 4th birthday.  Moon Sand is a terrible toy--ugly and messy.  He seemed to enjoy playing with it (but no more than Play Doe), but the clean up is horrible.  The sand stuck to the treads of his shoes and was tracked throughout the house. 
I am very happy with the resulting prints from this camera.  I've used other brands in the past and never have had such bright colors and in focus shots.  The winding mechanism is easy to use.  Finally I have pictures of my diving expeditions to remember. ---  --- It's even suited for kids over ten to use.  Mine had lots of fun with their own Quick Snap
This product does absolutely nothing.  It made my face look even more queasy and dry at the same time.  Save your money
I was unable to return the item because of restrictions imposed by their return policy ---  --- I made a mistake by buying i
The movies and stories are classic westerns, the quality is horrible, these are not remastered.  It looks like they found the oldest copy of the film and transfered it to DVD.  If I didn't like the actual movies, I would not buy knowing the quality
My family received this magazine for years, but recently we have decided not to re-new our subscription. This used to be a quality product but it has recently gone downhill with the inclusion of more and more advertising in each issue. At this point, nearly half of the magazine consists of advertisements--this isn't the real science magazine it claims to be, and is a waste of money.  ---  --- The content is not all that great. The articles are often extremely short, too short for even a pre-teen audience. My kids often wished that this magazine included more serious science topics, and not just shortened, dumbed-down material. Much of the magazine is full of "fluff"-- things like word searches and picture matching games, which didn't interest my children. The content might be okay for 7-8 year olds and children at slightly lower reading levels, but older children will be bored.  ---  --- All in all, I'd recommend that you simply get the regular, adult version of National Geographic. Though the articles might be too complex for children, the pictures will make up for what they can't read.  ---  --- If you're looking for more of a children's-oriented magazine, you're better off with MUSE, a high quality general science magazine that is published by the Smithsonian Museum in Washington, DC. However, Muse caters to a slightly older audience, perhaps ages 9 and up.
I bought this to work with my eMac/700.  It met all of the system requirements given.  What wasn't said was that it wasn't supported by the Mac's 10.3.9 operating system and would only work while running the Toast 6 lite.  In other words I couldn't read or write disks from any other application on the Mac.  In fact it would immediately eject the disk when I quit Toast. ---  --- Luckily, Amazon took it back.  They even paid the postage.  Unfortunately I'm still out my hours of research and 30 mile drive getting it to the post office.  Additionally,  having found a new "hi tech" way to fib,  I'm discourage from buying computer peripherals from Amazon.  I blame Sony for this.  I know Amazon can't check out every manufacturer's claims
This is a nice smell that turns babypowderish on me.  My fiancee LUVS it.  He is also a huge fan of Chanel No.
more of a novelty than a useful flashlight. need to shake it a lot to get a charge and even then the emitted light is too low to be useful. the switch has also broken and we havent even used the flashlight more than a couple times...would not recommend buying this flashlight, trying to return mine.
My 12 year old daughter plays this game for hours at a time.  She is a horse nut and loves it.  The player gets to groom, breed and train horses.  I would definetly recommend for any horse crazy kid
Through most of the 1990s, I lived overseas in both Europe and Asia.  Unfortunately, my number of photos from these times are limited to a handful as I hated looking like a "tourist" with my bulky camera!  Nowadays, I no longer have to worry about that because of cameras like this one!  I intially bought this T7 after using a friend's T1 and being impressed with the size of it.  The T7 is obviously considerably smaller, which is even better!   ---  --- I bought this camera right as they were coming out and paid well over $400 for it plus a 1GB Memory Stick Pro.  Both are investments that even to this day (over a year later) I am very happy with.  I have taken this camera just about everywhere and wherever I go people love to look at it.  I can say I've probably sold at least a dozen of these to people that fell in love with the size of the camera and the quality of photos it takes.   ---  --- As far as size, that is the biggest plus to it's advantage.  It can fit anywhere.  Even with the optional case that you can buy for it, it still easily fits in a trouser or jacket pocket, without even a noticable bulge.   ---  --- As far as photo quality goes, as most of the reviews note, the camera is very limited when it comes to night time shots.  I've found that these shots are often hit and miss as far as what you'll get, but for the size of the lens and the size of the flash, what can you expect?  After shooting a few thousand photos with this camera, I know what will be a good and bad night shot, and with the playback feature, you can quickly see the quality of your photo and retake if needed.  Is it perfect? No, but that's super tough in a camera this small. ---  --- Some reviews note the difficulty trying to take a photo while holding the camera still.  I've never had issue with this, but I could see how it could be an issue, it's just never one either my wife (the primary user) or I have dealt with.  I would venture that probably the vast majority of buyers of this camera will likewise not have a problem. ---  --- I've recorded more than a few .mpg movies with the camera and it surprisingly outperformed some of my bigger (and more expensive) point-and-shoot digital cameras.  I have been very pleased with that.   ---  --- Another drawback noted by many reviews is the LCD screen and the chance of breaking it.  I put a plastic screen protector (the thin plastic sheet type held by static) on it as soon as I bought it and haven't had a problem.  I've sat on the camera before (by accident, of course!) and have had it in luggage and the like, but have never had a problem. ---  --- The most significant drawback that I've had with the camera is that it can take more photos (esp with the 1GB card) than the battery will last.  Buy a second battery and you'll be more than good, but it's just something to keep in mind. ---  --- I would highly recommend this camera for anyone who travels, or anyone who wants a camera to take quick photos.  It can be carried anywhere and for the vast majority of shots, it's all that you need. I can say that we have many photos of our kids (and really good ones, too) that we would never had gotten if my wife didn't regularly carry this camera in her purse and diaper bag! I'm happy enough with it that I'm going to buy a second one for myself (especially now that the prices have dropped so much!) so that my wife can use our first one entirely for her own photography.  I give it five stars and would definately recommend it to others
Is Good, protecs every corner of your phone, the keyboard and the screen! Its very good! 100% Recomendation
This set is perfect for my daughter's new toy oven (miele) that she received for Christmas.  The pots and pans are sized just right and the utensils are fit perfectly with the pots and pans.  One of my utensils already broke apart, but that happens.  I have a 3 year old girl who loves to cook, but she IS 3 and is not always careful.  Not sure whether that utensil wasn't made well enough or it's a 3 year old's play, but the rest of the set seems fine.  I would recommend this and the Miele oven
Like other users have experienced, this unit is no longer functional after 18 months.  The wired base is still working but the wireless range extender no longer fires up all 3 led lights.  Poor product Netgear
Liked this magazine enough to order it but it gets one star for wasting my money. Thought it'd be simple enough to order it from amazon like i do everything else. But instead i've paid and never received it. I haven't been able to log a compaint with amazon cause every time i do it links me somewhere else, so this is the first chance i've had to even say i've been ripped off. They may eventually send it but it's not likely at this point, it's been a couple months now
I wouldn't call these a regrettable purchase...I guess I was just a little mislead about how these thing worked.  It doesn't explain that on the packaging.  ---  --- I couldn't figure out why the box was so heavy.  They are just socks, right?  Right??  Well, they aren't.  The insides are coated with some sort of heavy-duty silicone.  This makes your feet sweat when you put them on.  I mean, they really sweat.  When you wake up, you're feet have sweat so much that any outer layer of skin cells you have sloughed off.  Hence the soft feet.  And very warm feet.  They'll be good for winter. ---  --- The reason why you're only supposed to wear these once a week is because I bet you'll get a really alarming fungus if you do it more.  I tried them two nights in a row once and day 3 greeted me with an intense athletes-foot-like itch.  Not fun.   ---  --- The other gripe I have is that they don't come with washing instructions.  Great.  These socks have one purpose in life, and that is to make your feet sweat and then refuse to be washed.  I found that handwashing them in the sink with some handsoap works fine.  For now, anyway.  I don't think they belong in the washing machine.  A laundry horror story is likely to ensue.    
I ordered this antenna to enhance the reception of the UHF channels. I live in a big city and I thought I shouldn't have a problem with any indoor antenna. it seems I was mistaken. this antenna is useless. it is almost no better than my previous 99 cents store antenna
These were exactly what i wanted and tasted great in my home-made mint cocoa nib ice cream, where the bitterness didn't turn you off from the product.
Wonderful for those who type and work with computers alot--soft and comfortable!  I haven't had any problems with carpal tunnel since!  It didn't have a nasty smell as other reviewers stated.  A great buy; saves me a lot of pain
I see that "Linda" has already laid down the exact same review for all the colors and all the nibs of this pen, so there's not much new I can tell you other than, (1)  To confirm what she wrote, and (2), to add a few new details. ---  --- This is an excellent introduction to fountain pens for those with hesitancy about buying one.  I've collected a few vintage and new fountain pens over the years; some of them lay in a display box, loved but unused. On contrast, you will use this pen!  It's incredibly cheap for the quality, so you get a basically positive experience (smooth flowing liquid expression) without the price, or the ultimate cost...losing the darn thing.  At prices ranging from $40 to $400 and beyond (Amazon.com sells a Namiki fountain pen for well over $4,000), the habitual loser of inanimate objects would be understandably reluctant to invest in a gold-nibbed, laquered objet-d'art, and would opt instead for this beautiful cheaply that even CALLS itself "disposable!"  ---  ---  --- It's a personal preference, but I'd opt for the fine nib over the medium if you're going to use this everyday--you'll write faster and use less ink. The medium is nice for big John Hancock-ish signatures and weighty thoughts, but you lose a little expression (those personal shadings and slight angles that even the untrained can't help but produce). The steel nib writes surprisingly smoothly, and as mentioned above, the ink doesn;t evaporate too quickly.  You can't refill the pen (it's DISPOSABLE just because of that), but you can buy several in different colors and nib sizes, and get some idea of what kind of pen suits you.   ---  --- If and when you feel like you want to purchase a re-fillable fountain pen, try for something under $50.  Levenger.com's excellent "True Writer" and the "Retro" brand pens sell for about this much.  Although those liquidy smooth gel pens have taken some over some of the non-ballpoint market, the mechanically-minded will enjoy the physics of bottle-filling a pen; others will simpy dig the tradition of using a pen with a rich history.  When it comes to fountain pens, the "P" is for panache.
I wanted a digital tire monitor becuz theyre supposed to be more accurate than the stick models. This gauge comes with instructions and is fairly easy to use. My favorite part of this gauge is the bleed valve. With other gauges, you have to put in air, then check the gauge, put in air, check it again. With this gauge, you can overinflate your tires a little bit, then bleed the air out with the valve til you reach your desired PSI. ---  --- Assuming this lasts a long time, I would recommend it to everyone
It's a handy mirror for the price but if your looking for a good vanity mirror, I suggest looking for something larger with a higher magnification.  The light is not great at all.  It's very dim.  One of the good qualities of the mirror is that it's cordless and comes with an adapter if you don't have batteries handy
I had heard of how amazing Final Fantasy VI was supposed to be. So, I thought, I have to get this game, even if to just fill out my Final Fantasy collection. ---  --- First off, I will start with V. I had heard from many sources that this game wasn't very good. I, in fact, find it just as good as VI!  ---  --- VI is just as good as I was expecting. It's funny, and has very memorable characters and dialog.   ---  --- My only problem with the two games is that there is a bit of a lag.  The lag is not bad at all in V, but is pretty noticable in VI. While, it was a minor inconvience to me, most people may find it more irritating. --- Don't get me wrong,I don't think the lag is enough to actually mess you up, but it can get a little annoying. ---  --- Overall, I got two great games for the price of one bargain game. I must say, I am completely satisfied
This rangefinder is great! Much lighter than the big bulky other units. Has all the great features that is needed. This is one that you will take with you and not leave in the truck because it's too big.  I tested this against some of my buddies' bigger units at known distances and this one out did the bigger units in speed and accuracy. Great scan mode. Best buy.  Should be sold for about ($) more than asked for
It puts out a cloud of water vapor and it's not all that noisy but I had no idea I'd be spending so much time each day taking the humidifier apart, wiping it down, trying to insert my hand inside the tank to wipe that down, refilling the tank twice a day, and wondering why this humidifier doesn't have an automatic shuftoff in case I forget to turn it off. At least the filters and cleaning cartidges are easy to find. However, this is too much like an unwanted hobby so I'll be looking for another way to raise the relative humidity in my room
Clip is uneasy to use. Arrows fell off after my first run. Would never by anything from this manufacturer again
We have enthusiastically played Candy Land with each of our three kids.  It is easily the best starting point for introducing a child to board games.  Players take turns drawing from a deck and moving their pieces around the board.  The cards have one or two squares of a particular color (such as red, green, yellow, etc.) and players move pieces ahead on the path to the next matching spot of the same color.  No counting or reading is required.  There are also special cards that can move a player ahead or behind, and they are indicated by  picture of the spot on the board to which the player should move their piece.  Play continues until one player reaches the end. ---  --- Some of my observations: ---  --- 1) Most kids can probably start playing and enjoying this game before the recommended 36 months of age.  If you have a child with the attention span and the desire to sit down for a 10-15 minute game, I'm pretty confident they could enjoy it. ---  --- 2) Among the lessons our kids learned from CandyLand: taking turns, recognizing colors, and dealing with disappointment.   Luckily, the games are quick enough that it is usually possible to play multiple games in one seting.  This makes it possible to keep playing until each child has had at least one win.  (Very helpful for managing little egos) ---  --- 3) For such a simple game, it manages to perfectly balance the possibility of changes in fortune without seeming arbitrary.  The game is literally in doubt until the last card is played (one of the "special" cards might send a player back to near the start).  This is great for teaching that most valuable of lessons: "NEVER give up". ---  --- 4) With most simple games, it is almost impossible to get older kids to play after they reach a certin age.  We have not found that to be as true with Candy Land.  We've had games with an adult and kids ages 3, 6, and 9 playing together and having fun.  If you have more than one kid, you know how hard this can be. ---  --- As a parent of three, I give this game my highest recommendation
I have subscribed to this magazine for almost a year now and I have become very skeptical of much of its advice.  This advice seems to be heavily influenced by its paying advertisers e.g. the US Dairy Industry (there is always at least one of those annoying "got milk" ads) and not surprisingly, every issue there are several articles in the magazine that hype the supposed benefits of a diet high in dairy products (e.g. milk and cheese).  However having read many books on nutrition, it has become very clear to me that that the majority of current research shows that a diet high in dairy products can actually be very damaging to your health - for instance read the The China Study by Colin Campbell, an extremely comprehensive nutritional study that sheds a great deal of light on the US dairy industry and its shady methods of influencing the public's perception of the healthfulness of its products.  It is well known that there are many better ways of getting calcium etc into your diet than by dairy but this magazine is unfortunately blinded by its advertisers' paychecks.  The magazine also appears to be very similar to Prevention magazine which I also have subscribed to and I would make the same criticism of.  My advice is to stick to reliable sources on health like the excellent "Berkeley Wellness Letter" that are not supported or influenced by the advertisements of drugs companies or powerful industry groups like the US Dairy Industry
I got this because I thought it was a good deal, but the clothes weren't very cute and weren't good quality.  I gave them all away, I don't recommend
My Braun thermoscan has given me nothing but trouble. --- Yes this ear thermometer is easy to use.  You just have to stick it into the canal correctly.  Not hard.  What I don't like is you can stick it in the same ear, the same way, 6 different times and get very different readings. --- Everytime I have gone to use my thermometer, the battery would be dead.  You have to use the special medical circular batteries, so of course I would never have any handy.  Then I got smart and started stocking up on the batteries.  They are expensive.  And everytime I would use it I'd have to put in a fresh new battery. --- This also needs the disposable ear covers in order for it to work.  Yes there is a trick to getting around it but then your thermometer isn't sanitary.  Finding the covers was sometimes easy and sometimes impossible. --- I have just never been happy with it.  Yes it's easier than the oral... But I found one even better.  Try the Temporal Artery Thermometer.  You can use that one on a sleeping child
This potty is simple and very easy to clean with only two pieces.  It is also more stable than others we used.  We like it
I bought this table for my almost 8 month old who is starting to pull up on things.  I thought this would be safe for her to learn to stand with because it has hand grippers along the sides of the table (just for that purpose) and is recommended for ages 6 months+.  All of the fun shapes, colors, and sounds immediately caught her attention.  She cawled over to it and when she tried to pull herself up it fell over ontop of her.  She bumped her head and cried, but fortunately, wasn't hurt.  I put a rug under it thinking maybe that would help make it more stable, but as soon as she tried to pull up again (within 5 minutes of taking it out of the box) it fell over on her again.  The top of the table is very heavy, but the legs are not very sturdy, making it topheavy and easy to topple.  Needless to say, I took it back to the store.   --- I would not recommend this toy unless you only wanted to take the legs off and use it on the floor, or if you have a toddler who is very steady at standing on his own.  Personally, I think the recommended age should be changed for older children or this toy should be recalled and the legs redesigned.
Use original Epson Brand ink, the heads in the epson printers it's in the printer itself not in the ink cartridge, it dosent worth saving some dollars and ruing the printer
Kids love this quarter pipe.  However, did not ship in a timely fashion due to amazon delay in ordering and had NO directions.  Luckily a friend had almost the same thing and we pretty much figured it out after a phone call to the company.  It did take a while to assemble
It's time to switch to any product BUT a Symantec one: what was once the best security software company for PC users is now the worst.  ---  --- It was time to upgrade my Systemworks Premier to the 2007 version, so I checked out the '07 features online. But where was Password Manager? Hell, I have 187 passwords and logins I DEPEND UPON Password Manager to fill in -- at least 30 of them a day. After an hour on the phone with allegedly 'English-speaking' Symantec CSR's in Bombay, the story I got was that customer surveys prompted them to 'drop' Password Manager. Not being stupid, I said, 'let me guess, Symantec's going to roll out a stand-alone Password Manager to extort another $40 from me'. 'Oh, no, sir, no, no...' ---  --- And here it is: a $[...] rip-off, nothing but Password Manager -- not so cleverly disguised as 'the Vault' -- along with other features IE7 provides for free, and marketed as a 'new' online security program.  ---  --- Symantec seems to put more effort into playing marketing games with their customers than they do into making the programs they sell WORK correctly. Norton Anti-Virus is a MESS; it's once-a-week Wednesday night updates are now a joke: launch your attack, release your new virus on a Thursday morning and you'll have millions of NAV subscribers at your mercy for at least a week. Three times in the past few months, NAV has failed to stop an attack -- after several years of never failing. Systemworks too seems to be causing more problems than it solves (I'm continually rolling back to undo 'fixes' One Button Checkup or WinDoctor creates, after the 'fix' crashes my system).  ---  --- Goodbye, Norton, hello McAfee -- or ANYBODY else. This rip-off -- deleting Password Manager from Systemworks only to regurgitate it as this bug-filled mess called Norton Confidential -- is the last straw
This is the worst pump you could buy.  I have gone through 3 of them because the motor breaks down.  It also has put me behind in what my daughter is drinking while I am at work.  PLEASE don't waste your money.......  I also spoke with hospitals and they mentioned that they have many many complaints about this product.  If you don't believe the bad reviews call the hospital and they will tell you the same thing.  I recently got a new pump from a friend and found that the evenflow is by far the LOUDEST pump on the planet -- there is no descreet pumping for you if you own this product
I purchased this shirt for my golfer mom for Christmas and had to return it.  I bought an XL because she normally wears a 16, but the shirt was about the right size for me (an 8).  The quality seemed to be fine, but the sizing was very misleading
There are plenty of anti-Bush films and books around. If you only shall see or read one, this must be the best pick. I like Michael Moore very much, but he is not really a political heavyweighter. And i don't think Fahrenheit 9/11 is his best work, it does not mix humour and political insight as well as   the book "stupid white men" for instance. It is more like two or three movies in one.  --- William Karel IS a political heavyweighter and he does not try to make anything more than a documentary. But what a documentary it has turned out to be. Very disturbing insights from informed sources, among them former CIA-agents. It is not usual to hear such plain speaking from "people in high places" just a few years after the events. This film is perhaps not as entertaining as Fahrenheit 9/11, but far more informative.
Can't rave about this enough.  If you like sardines, this is the way to go.  Just plain delicious
I bought a pair of these, my wife tried them and liked them so much that she asked me to get a pair for her for Valentines Day (chocolates and flowers don't do it for her).  These headphones sound as good as my Bose for a fraction of the cost but give up a little in comfort (they do fit better with more use).  Do they really need that thick of a cord?
My last Braun Razor was model 6550, which I purchased 7 years ago. The Braun 8975 is a pleasure using, quick and close shave. The technology has come a long way. I have always used Braun and this is by far the best yet.
But I won't because I paid good money for it.  As you can see from the other reviews, the speed on this thing is pathetic, almost to the point of non-functional when it comes to many small files.  I had a small game on the drive, but it has tons of small files in the folder. It took over 10 minutes to delete a 10 mb folder... makes you wonder if SanDisk spent 10 minutes to test this thing. Stay away.. or if you really want one, buy mine please
It realy has been a long wait after Jellyfish. This Roger Joseph Manning solo effort is as beautiful as music can get, giving wagonloads of goosebumps all the way. If you have a craving for the ultimate in sophisticate popmusic you should get this rare jewel.  --- And don't wait for the US release: it lacks one song from a perfect 11 like the Japanese has. I sure wouldn't want to miss any of these tracks. Very higly recommended!
      This is a well thought of game.  A game where the players play along with the DVD as the Gatemaster gives you commands, rewards, or punishiments while they are playing the game.  Players can also watch the rules and the setup instructions on the DVD.  Six keys of six different types will be laid out on some of the spaces, as your goal is to get one of each type and rush to the center before 49 minutes is up.  If neither player wins in 49 minutes, the Gate master has defeated you.  In the beginning you write down your fears and reveal them at the end which is always fun.  The board has six territories.  Each character owns a territory which has a set of the same keys.  You can pick up a key by landing on the key space, having a card telling you to, gate master telling you to, or winning a duel.  A duel is when you land on a battle space and 2 players wager a key for a dice roll to see who gets both.  There are two types of cards... TIME and FATE.  Land on a skull head and get a FATE card which allows you to do something in a certain situation.  A TIME card you get if you land on a clock.  A time card allows you to do something if you play it in the exact second it tells you to. Sometimes the Gate master will give you the power to banish someone.  When there is reward, there is also punisment.  If you land on the cursed key, you have to pick it up and whenever you have it, you cannot win.  If you are landed into a black hole, you cannot participate until you are freed.  Also, you can lose keys.  During the game the Gate master says "Stop!" frequently and the players will have to lisen to what he says or be punished.  All in all, it is one of the best games out there and well worth the money.
Save your money...Because if you buy these for your kids you are going to need your money for the hospital....They do not work like you think that would..You kid is only bouncing on big rubber bands...And fall ever time they try to bounce...very dangerous..they aren't made for anyone..they should be taken off the marke
i like a little bit of it, doesent mean its good, i wont throw it away or anything, ill just let it sift...wait...and look at the album cover most of the time. slayer is getting better though
I agree with M. Arse with the 2star rating. I was disappointed with this camera from the beginning. Not a user friendly one and the pictures turn out very grainy with bad color quality unless you are in an optimum light. I'm interested in the 7 Mp camera Canon offers. I've read that it has much better shutter speed. Recommended??
Have had an Olympus 4.0M.for 4 years and been very happy with it. As a gift I got this Canon and was very diappointed in the color quality and sharpness. Shot about 600 pictures people were blurred,not crisp and dim even on a sunny day. Had to return it.Don't bu
My wife and I, huge fans of `America's Next Top Model' and `Project Runway', were very excited about seeing this film.  Why it took us this long still baffles me, but as of Friday night we had the pleasure of seeing `The Devil Wears Prada' and let me just say that it was quite the pleasure.  Now, most if not all the praise has been heaped on the shoulders of Meryl Streep, and while she was outstanding, this film is more than just a Meryl painted canvas.  There are four brilliant performances in this film and they all are deserving of praise. ---  --- First is Anne Hathaway who plays Andrea Sachs, a young aspiring journalist who takes a job working as Miranda Priestly assistant at `Runway Magazine'.  Anne Hathaway proves with her performance that she's all grown up.  No, that's not to take away from her more adult roles in more adult films like `Havoc' and the masterpiece `Brokeback Mountain', but here Anne proves that she can do adult comedy, not falling back into her teen goofiness that made her famous in `The Princess Diaries' but keeping everything smart and mature.  She has enough poise and grace to match wits with Miranda, and she does so elegantly. ---  --- Next up is Emily Blunt who plays Emily, Miranda's first assistant (there are two, Andrea being the second).  Emily has worked her butt off to get to where she is, slaving for the unruly Priestly and it's all about to pay off with a trip alongside Miranda to Paris.  The only thing standing in her way is Andrea, for if Andrea fails miserably then it reflects poorly on Emily.  Emily Blunt turns out I think the best performance of the bunch for she has enough sass, enough attitude and enough wit to make her pop out from the screen and stand out no matter who is sharing the screen with her. ---  --- Stanley Tucci also does wonderfully here as Nigel, Miranda's second in command.  He is there to make sure everything is perfect, and also help Andrea adjust.  Stanley always has done great backup work, playing second hand man to just about everyone, but here he really makes his performance his own and owns it.  He delivers some of the funniest lines in the film but he never feels like the `token gay guy'...he's needed in this film, not filler, and he commands his scenes and really stands out amidst the crowd. ---  --- And then, of course, we have Meryl Streep who plays the ruthless tyrant known as Miranda Priestly.  What I was most impressed about was the way Meryl underplays every word, every emotion, every scene, which is not what I expected.  I really expected her to go all Glen Close and reincarnate Cruella but she didn't (thankfully) and instead turned out one of the most inspired performances of the year.  She must have had fun playing the snooty self absorbed and above all selfish editor-in-chief of `Runway'.  She lets us see inside her character briefly (when crying over another failed marriage) but her character is more about shutting off feeling in order to succeed and so we don't get to see the real Miranda because we're not supposed to. ---  --- Carried by these four brilliant performances `The Devil Wears Prada' is a fabulous film that will make you laugh and make you smile and will impress almost anyone.  The script is brilliantly adapted from Lauren Weisberger's novel, and while it's not an exact replica (are any adaptations these days?) it carries the same wit but smoothes things out to make it more approachable and, in my eyes, more enjoyable.  Bravo
After ruining another pair of over-the-head headphones, I decided to check these out.  They are actually on sale at 50% off, and I've just tried mine out.  The audio is very sharp, especially with the base, though it seems to be not as loud as my old pair, I can just increase the volume to compensate.  At $35, this is a GREAT deal.  They feel great.  The band that most headphones have presses down on your head, but not too much.  It also folds down quite nicely, though it looks too brittle to be able to handle too much stress.  Haven't tried out the actual noise-cancellation feature, but if the rest of the headphone quality is consistent, then it will work just as well.  It also comes with a carrying bag that can probably also hold your MP3 player, if you so wished.  However, it easily fits into a jacket pocket.  Great, great, great design and comfort
She's out of state taking care of her cranky parents (mom damaged a hip, dad is helpless when these things happen), and needed something to boost her spirits. She loved it--she prefers small jewelry, so it was perfect for her.
This 1993 movie, based on Michael Shaara's book The Killer Angels, is over four hours long, but it uses that time well to document this critical Civil War battle.  I used the word `document' on purpose because this movie is accurate to the point of being a documentary.  It was even filmed at the Gettysburg National Military Park.  When you see the fight for Little Round Top or Pickett's Charge, or another fight, you are seeing the events much as they happened where they happened.     ---  --- Thousands of civil war re-enactors play the everyday soldiers you see in the background and in the grand charges of this battle.  These amateur enthusiasts put their heart into this movie and it shows.      ---  --- As a high school history teacher, I was timing certain parts of the movie to show in class.  When I timed Pickett's Charge, I realized it is shown in real time.  Those Confederate soldiers charged into Union gunfire for 28 minutes and you see every moment in this movie. ---  --- Read The Killer Angels and then see this outstanding movie. ---  --- Kyle Prat
I purchased this lens back in March of 2005 to shoot static "Warhammer models" with my 10D.  I found that longer lenses such as the Sigma 105mm, the Canon EF 100mm, and the Tamron SP Autofocus 90mm all were "too long" with the 10D's 1.6 focal crop and would result in requiring me to use a lot more physical space that what I had room for to get the shot. ---  --- The Canon EF 50mm f/2.5 is nearly a perfect match with the 10D for this purpose.  Its small, its compact, and its short focal length do not require that I be standing three feet away from the model I'm shooting. ---  --- As far as shooting at non-static objects, such as insects, the lens is slow to focus and loud, in both noise and vibration, which results in "startled" subjects and missed shots. ---  --- The same also applies for non-macro shots as well.  Its slow focus makes it a poor choice for action photography, and its loud enough to draw attention to you when you are attempting other shots as well
This is a well constructed, cute bounce seat and my baby loves it.  I am very pleased with the purchas
I have white everlast boxing shoes & they are very comfortable & I thought these ones were the same. the difference is that the other ones have soft parts in it where the feet move when boxing.  ---  The black ones are uncomfortable in the back side where the division of the shoe is.  They don't move well.  ---  plus they charged almost $ 20. for shipping. so I ended up paying a lot for them.
This game is very good. They only add in a coople people to the stoy line but that is cool. The game folows the movies well. You can even blow up buildings. The only thing i dislike about this game is that is a littel repeditave. Lastly, you can get in high speed cases with the cops
I ordered this gun because it was such a great deal. When it arrived, i took it out of the box and the barrel was cracked (a big crack), nothing a little gorrila glue can't fix though. Also the accuracy isn't consistent, it is always about 4 or 5 inches off from about 20-30 feet. I had to put the back part of the laser off the sliding mechanism to get it to be accurate, otherwise it was 3 feet high. The pellet also starts to curve after 15 feet or so too. So this gun was a good deal but isn't the best quality gun i've had. You have to load it from the top of the gun, which means taking off the laser, putting in the bbs, and putting on the laser again. The magazine doesn't even come off! It still has decent speed, and isn't crap (it's just bad). It was worth 15 bucks though
The item by itself is perfect to protect the phone from Scratches, it fits like a glove , really nice , the delivery from Eforcity was really fast and well packed but it got cracked  after 5 days of use, it wasn't hit or treated carelessly. I'll order some more because they are really cheap and  it's better to have a cracked cover than a broken phone.Love how the phone looks in it while it was in good condition, the case started falling apart in cracked pieces and after 8 days I had to dump it.
Read the reviews and picked the elephant for my 17m old child's nusery. I absolutely love it. Before this, my son could not sleep well with our "family's" humiifier because it was too noisy. Within an hour of bringing this home, it was set up (very easily) and he took one of many 2 1/2 hour naps that week! No filters, No noise, NO PROBLEMS thus far! I did have it on high for the first 20 mins and found a puddle of water underneath, but the humidifier was near a window, and i am asumming there was a draft that may have directed the steam toward the dresser top. (The problem was resolved once moved unto a different surfacetop) Filling it is a snap and the very fine mist (looked like small stream of fog) was a pleasure to see out of the trunk of the animal! The tank seems to last longer than the box states. It is on it's third day on a low/med setting and it still only has a 3 inch difference at the top. I love the safety features and I don't have to worry about the tank still on if it's empty since it has an automatic shut off! The light is not a problem since he likes to have a tiny bit of light in his room. It is a design that will last thoughout his childhood! Thank you Crane!
There are much better products by LUSH. ---  --- I got a free sample of this conditioner and used it along with LUSH's Trichomania solid shampoo.  At first I really liked it, but throughout the day, my hair felt like it was getting oilier.  I'm not sure if it was the Trichomania or the Coolaulin, but I gave both away to my friend who likes coconut.  The smell wasn't my favorite either (I'm not a coconut person), but if you like coconut, you will love the shampoo and the conditioner. ---  --- As for me, I will stick to American Cream and Rehab. ---  --- **UPDATE** --- December 21, 2005 --- I tried the Coolaulin conditioner again, and my hair didn't get oily at all.  I'm not sure what happened the first time I tried it, but it was fine this time around.  I'm not a coconut person, so this conditioner is still not my fave (American Cream!!), but I do want to add on TWO stars and make the rating *~*FOUR STARS*~* because the conditioner made my hair really soft
These tops were cute, for my 7 & 10 year old neices.  How in the world did they justify putting a size 2x on these things? 
We were excited for the first bunch of stickers and then my 5 year old wanted to try it himself.  It jammed up and that was the end of it.  There are no instructions on how to fix it so I threw the cartridge away.  Don't waste your money
I just bought this iron and I couldn't be happier. It's the perfect size and weight. The plates aren't unmanageably large, or pitifully small... It heats up incredibly fast-- we're talking in less than 60 seconds. I have short-ish, wavy and coarse hair- it's straight and silky smooth within 5 minutes. HAI is a brand used in many salons and it's all for a reason- they make fantastic flat irons. If you bought this same iron at a salon, you could easily pay upwards of $150 in Canada... so I consider this price an awesome deal
I bought this for my sister for Christmas.  I have a similar one that is bigger, that I bought while in Charleston, SC.  She fell in love with mine, and since driving 4 hours just to buy a necklace was out of the question, I decided on this one.  At first, when it arrived, I thought it would be too small, but my sister does not wear large neclaces, earrings, etc... Turns out she loved it.  It was just perfect for her, especially since her neck is thin and her complexion is olive
These shoes were not put together very well. The bottom of the heal part broke of and was bending inward from the second I put them on. If I had the choice to buy this breand again I would not. These shoes were very over priced and not put together well at all. I am very disappionted
If you appreciate caliente, you MUST try this
 --- I find most "stoner" movies to be too juvenile to bother with. This is not a typical stoner movie, though, because the leads are not slacker losers, they're intelligent guys (one's an investment banker, the other an aspiring med student) who happen to like to hang out together and smoke dope. Which, truth be told, is pretty accurate of a lot of twenty somethings today.  ---  --- The best bits are hilarious. Watch out for the British twin sisters, the evangelical tow truck driver, and Neil Patrick Harris (Doogie Howser) as a sex crazed drug addled party animal. The only scene that fell flat for me was the one with the cheetah. Pointless and not funny. That said, this is not highbrow humor. But if this were just a series of frat boy jokes it would have fallen as flat as most other movies of the genre. What really elevates this movie is the Harold and Kumar characters. Silly antics aside, these guys are really likeable and have great on screen buddy chemistry.  ---  --- I don't know why I haven't seen John Cho and Kal Penn in more movies, but the ending makes me hopeful that there will be a sequel
At first, I thought this product was great, and I used it for a few days. Then, I noticed that my face was getting red and swollen. Now, I look all deformed. I am really upset!! The acid ate away at my face and I am still waiting for my face to heal. I called Neutrogena and they said it is probably an allergic reaction.  ---  ---  ---  --- March 23, 2007, Update: After the swelling on my face went down, my whole body started itching, and I had to go see two different doctors. The internist said that it got into my system, and gave me two strong prescriptions to get it out of my system. I took the medication for over 2 weeks, and used Cortizone 10 several times a day to relieve the itching. My arms and legs are all scared. There are still marks now even though my arms and legs have healed. This was the worst product that I have ever used, and I don't even have sensitive skin. I never had a problem with a product ever!! I was very careful when I used Rapid Clear. It never got in my eyes, nose, or mouth. I used it once a day for a week until my face swelled up and turned all red. I looked like the character on Mask. Horrifying!!! I will never ever buy another dangerous product from Neutrogena, again!!!! I will tell everyone what happened to me!!! The funny thing is..... one person that I told this to, who also saw my swollen face,.... she said this exact thing happened to her with another Neutrogena product. So, I know it's not just me! What the heck is Neutrogena putting in their products?  ---  ---  ---  --- 
Okay, take everything that you know about John Squire. Strip away the amazing Stone Roses first album, the not so amazing follow up, the nice brit pop of his work with the Seahorses and picture this as a solo album from a new artist and I honestly think that peoples thoughts on this album would change drastically. They would realize that every track on it is a winner and that the guitar work is amazing and beautiful, the vocals might be grating at first (Think Robert Forster (The Go-betweens) circa Before Hollywood) but that upon repeated listens grows on you and you eventually end up loving. What you expect going into an album has alot to do with how much you like or dislike it and this album is no exception. People should listen to it for what it is and not for what John Squire was...John Squire is an established song writer who has moved beyond what he used to do (who hasn't moved on in 13 years? minus Robert Smith of course!) and now writes beautiful pop songs...John Squire has grown up just like his original audience has and this solo album is the perfect proof of that
I liked this workout the first time I bought it as her fatburning workout.  The second time I bought it re-packaged I thought it was a fluke. This time I bought this since it sounded more like weight training and less like circuit training, so it must be different.  Nope.  I have 5 Kathy Smith videos, all three with different titles and covers only three different contents. I feel this is highly unethical and contacted her company.  One month later and I have yet to receive a response. 
Camera arrived earlier than I expected, and was just what I wanted. Very small, but versitle. Large screen. Very satified with my purchase
I bought this for my son (recommended by his special ed teacher) and the whole family has been using it ever since.  It's a nice, sturdy, trampoline and it's not too expensive.  The "folding" part is a little disappointing which I why it's not getting full stars.  However, we haven't needed to use that feature so it wasn't that important to us.  Overall this is a good quality trampoline for those who are looking for something less expensive
I bought a copy of this magazine and initially enjoyed a great deal of it, but ultimately found it distasteful.  It was graphically hyperactive, which became distracting and irritating, and there was something else that didn't seem quite right, though at first I couldn't identify just what that was.  Eventually I realized that it wasn't making a clear distinction between the editorial content and commerce (items offered by companies advertizing in the magazine, workshops sponsored by the magazine, books sold by the publisher of the magazine).  Eventually I figured out that the publisher was Australian.  If Rupert Murdoch is any guide, then this magazine is coming from a tradition that doesn't respect boundaries between journalism and financial gain.  I ended up putting this magazine aside in distaste
This is a great convenience. I have 2 of them to hold my EZ-pass in different cars. Much better than digging around for it and holding it up!  ---  --- The only thing I wish is that it came with additional adhesive--I had to get my windshield replaced and I ended up having to buy another one because it wouldn't stick to the new windshield
TO REPLACE THE BATTERY YOUR HAVE TO OPEN THE BACK, THAT MEANS YOU HAVE REMOVE IT FROM WHERE ITS STUCK, OPEN THE BACK AND RE-STICK IT AGAIN THUS LOOSING THE STRENGTH OF THE ORIGINAL GLU
This movie is so dumb that it's as good with the sound off as with the sound on.  The only reason to watch it is to observe the extreme beauty of both leads.   A plot as old as the written word could still form the basis of an OK movie with a good script, but this script has no charm, no wit, no nothing
:( these will give you pain. I bought these shoes because they looked rather cute in the picture, and considering they weren't just a $5 pair of shoes, i thought they would be somewhat comfortable, if not doable, to wear.  BUYER BEWARE:  these shoes will cut your heels.  they run a little small, so i suggest getting at least a half size larger.  if you want to do anything BESIDES sitting and looking pretty, DO NOT buy these shoes. I walked for less than 2 minutes before they started tearing and blistering my heels.  they also are a little tight on the toes, so if you have a wide foot, these definitely are not for you. i have to admit, they are darling and cute, but they are NOT WORTH THE PAIN.
Great looking watch, and I shopped around for the best price for about three weeks before I ordered from Amazon. Shipped lightning quick also
Needs more shoulder buttons.  Other than that, is good
I absolutely recommend this infant seat!  My son is almost 1 now and I am still using this seat.  It is fabulous for it's fabric options of colors and most importantly for it's roominess.  My son is on the chunky side, being an exclusively breastfed baby.  He is still quite comfortable in this seat and I love being able to just attach him to the stroller as i walk my 4 year old into her her preschool.  The travel system as a whole catches the eyes of many and I am always stopped by people saying.."what a ride!".  Well it is, quite a ride.  If you buy this car seat, it will last you for the entire FIRST YEAR of your baby's life.  Thank you Graco
I bought this to simplify our morning routines and save them from pouring large bowls and throwing it away. The kids loved the choices. The only downside was the portions were extremely small, even for my 4 year old. On average they ate two a day
Not sure if I just got a lemon or what but would never purchase this player again. It worked right most of the time, but found that at times it would confuse the change disc button with the eject button. I would have to turn the unit on and off to get it to "reset" and work correctly.  It's now about 9 months later and the unit decided it was time to stop working. --- Bought it because it was cheap and I guess I got what I paid for. Fork out the extra cash and purchase another brand
I absolutely love this magazine! This is a wonderful read for any who like short stories and mysteries! The magazine includes new writers as well as more well known ones. A wonderful magazine
I love this.  Everyone can have their own data and we can track our own progress.  It is very simple to use and the explanations are clear
"I am an honest seller and I insure 100% satisfaction to my customers.  I can also ship out a better quality beanie visor hat for you.  ---   --- Please withdraw the feedback:" -JTF Trading ---  --- Don't bother. I bought a better product from OldGlory. The feedback stays. People should know what they are buying. -Me ---  --- "Not a problem.  1 feedback doesn't hurt us at all because all of our other customers know about our products and our excellent customer service." -JTF Trading ---  --- Well, I guess all I can do is you "other customers" know what a POS this hat was. That, and I had the hassle of this guy emailing me after I thought I made it clear that the matter was closed.  ---  --- Try OldGlory for a better deal and a better product
Smithsonian says it like it was, albeit short and sweet.  Without sprinkling complex grammar and cute expressions that are the hallmark of so many publications, Smithsonian provides the latest meaningful scholarship, especially if it departs from traditional concepts.  Their photos are always profoundly informative and fresh, without cut and paste from the time-honored sources.  Their article on Gavrilo Princip, the assassin of Archduke Francis Ferdinand, shook me to the core.  Thanks Smithsonian.
We purchased eight of these (6 - 3/4 in. and 2 - 1 in.) for our beauty salon in 1994, and we've never used another brand since. With their quick heat-up time and multi-level heat options, these irons perform superbly for precision curls.  I was so pleased their performance that I bought one to use at home to replace my fancy Vidal Sassoon gold barrel, which only had two heat settings - Too Hot and Burnt Scalp.  The heating element is so efficient that Level 1 or 2 is probably sufficient for most home users.  Rarely did I have to set the iron at Level 4 or 5, and never above 5.  It takes less than a minute for the iron to heat up.  Four of the six irons we originally purchased lasted through 3+ years of constant professional use.  At the price we paid, our weekly cost averaged out to pennies.  If you purchase this product you will -NOT- be disappointed
I was expecting it to have a lot of International type music to it but it virtually sounded the same as the original.  I think I may have mistaken this cd title for another of Shania's.  Her music is great but I don't see a difference with the international version
This is a very mediocre Knights Kingdom set.  There's not much of interest going on here, and the small castle suffers from lazy design. ---  --- The colorful Knights Of Morcia are back, once again fighting against Vladek, the black knight.  Two of the good knights make an appearance here (blue and purple), and we also get Vladek, a dark soldier, and a skeleton.  The minifigs are as charismatic as ever, each sporting his own unique expression.  Vladek and his henchman have that cute "I'm evil" Lego frown.  Our knights are outfitted with the usual accessories.  Swords and shields, and a black hatchet for the henchman. ---  --- The scene is a small mountainside castle that is home to a large scorpion monster.  The creature is constructed from a mixture of regular and Technic parts, and he has hinged pieces for an articulated tail and pincers.  The blue knight is accompanied by his horse, who has a cute mini-catapult strapped to his side. ---  --- The scorpion can fit into his den at the base of the castle, which has a front gate that can be raised and lowered.  High atop the tower is a mini-catapult and a thin boom crane with a small barred jail cell dangling precariously from it.  The rest of the castle is just walls, floors, and a staircase.  This castle is very fragile.  Mine fell apart several times while I was working on building it.  On the whole, the design just isn't all that great.  Handle with care, and play with care.  Colors are mostly black, dark gray, dark red, and brown.  This set has one of those nice walls with the barred window, and some signature Knights Kingdom battlement pieces. ---  --- This set works as an addition to Vladek's Dark Fortress.  On its own, it's stunningly less impressive.  The good news is that a savvy Lego Maniac can take the castle parts and build a better castle with them. ---  --- My verdict:  one thumb up for the scorpion monster (who can be added to your other Knights Kingdom adventures), one thumb down for the rest.  Could've been better.  My advice is to get Vladek's Dark Fortress.  It's more than worth the price of admission.  For those still hungering for more Knights Kingdom action after Vladek's fortress has been built and conquered, this set is better than nothing
This software is "One Time Use"! If you have a notebook and laptop, you won't be able to install for both!  ---  --- It sucks
There have been innumerable Motorhead collections over the years, but this is one of the few that attempts to mix old with the new. On this collection, all the classics are present, and some newer material is thrown in as well. Unfortunately, there are some throw-away tracks, mainly the Girlscool and Headgirl tracks. (To be honest, these tracks are pretty much worthless.) Some live tracks are meshed in and fit well, and the newer songs help to add some variety to the old-scool stuff. ---  --- I would recommend this collection to listeners looking to get a nice, cheap collection of some of Motorhead's best just for the sake of getting into the band. But if you're wanting the prime collection of older material, save up some extra dough and buy "No Remorse" or "Stone Deaf Forever.
First off...the paint balls were two different colors and were both worng. second problem was that they blow up in your gun so easily..dont buy less you like cleanin your barrel!!
These egg whites work great and are economical.  I recently started a diet where I can only eat egg whites.  It seems such a waste to throw out the yolks, not to mention the mess of separating the eggs.  I use these mostly for baking and to add protein when cooking other foods.  Adding the powder has saved me a lot of time preparing the diet foods.  The powdered egg whites do have an "eggy" odor and have a slight aftertaste which is easily overcome by adding vanilla or other extracts when making protein shakes or other sweets
Moore shows us that outsourcing was big when Clinton was president. He makes you ashamed of big corporations that value money over employees. Big One will open your eyes
Good things: (1) Baby loves watching the hanging toys. (2) The nature sounds are very well done and very pleasant. ---  --- Bad things: (1) VERY troublesome to assemble. The supplied screws are a cheap metal and they are screwed into plastic threads. In the most critical support structure (the kickstand) I could not get all of the screws into their holes completely before the screws stripped out. But I did get it together well enough to use. However, I considered returning it to the store during assembly. (2) The vibration feature broke after about 1 month of use. (3) Baby cannot reach the toys, even at 3 months of age, and we have a very tall baby. (4) Toys are very easily removed from their "holes" so that you can't really move the chair without the toys falling out. (5) The rocker has a very big "footprint". It takes up about half of the surface area of our four-seat kitchen table
i have this nextel it works verry good im verry happy with it
Good CD, but where is his recent hit "I Wanna Feel That Way Again" and his classic hit "Walkin' To Jeruselum"
This is a great product and was better then I expected.  I needed a large quantity and working through Amazon was great.  I was a little disappointed in the packaging, because the box was basically open due to poorly placed tape. But, being able to track the package was great
It's small, folds down and is great to pack for a trip instead of your big hair dryer.  I just wish you could set it on cool and blow as fast cuz it does get pretty hot.  Very convenient item if you travel
I ordered this movie for my husband. He LOVES it! It's a funny entertaining movie and something you can watch over and over. No big plot - but it's got it's moments. I'm quite sure there is something for every European to be offended by... So keep a sense of humor and enjoy
This pocket companion serves as a concise overview of the most important facts & concepts from the parent textbook (Guyton's Textbook of Medical Physiology).  However, it does not contain all the details or some clinical relevances, that's why you have to go back to the parent textbok for furthur info
Like the other user I had to use a 1x8 under tires to clear my Honda civic. These ramps made changing oil a breeze. ---  --- Now I have to get rid of the old metal ramps
I bought these earrings for my 10-year old grandaughter for Christmas.  I think she has worn them everyday since - she loves them.  They are not large hoops; if fact, they are a bit small -- but perfect for her. For an adult, I think a little bit larger size would be better. All in all, I was very pleased with the earrings; the quality is very good.
Purchased Cobra 75 WX ST All-in-handset Mobile CB about 1 year ago. Easy installation, up-front controls, very convenient. Six months after installation speaker in mike failed, could only get sound through external speaker, using external jack. Repair shop said it would cost almost as much to fix as the unit cost. 
I love these crackers and was suprised to find them on amazon.com I first found them in Reading Pa and here in florida could not find them.  High fiber is important to me and these have more than most. 
Amazon shipped the watch very quickly, it arrived two days before they said it would and I was very happy with the weight and styling of the watch.  "A good purchase" I think to myself.  The only piece of styling I was not happy about was the large magnifier above the date on the watch, which is not visible on the amazon photos. When I pulled out the crown to set the time and date I got that sinking feeling that something wasnt right, and that feeling was followed by the whole crown comming out of the watch.  I was able to put it back in and set the time, but setting the date was not possible.  I used Amazons online return procedure, filling out an HTML entry field box about the problem and printed out postage and a barcode to put in the box.  I took it to the post office and the shipping was free, although the post office was not able to insure the shipment which kind of worried me.  That was 4 days ago and I still havent heard anything from amazon about the return, although they did say expect 5-9 days to process returns.  I hope it all goes well and I get a replacent watch.  I did read about this same problem on other Amazon reviews for similar watches by Invicta, so it is worth looking into before purchasing. 
I bought this software two days ago, Installed it on my laptop and all of a sudden, my network connection was messed up. I could not figure how to connect to the wireless or wired network. My other computers were still able to connect, so it was a problem with the computer with Fix It installed. After much work, I finally uninstalled the software and right away was able to get back on the network. I am not sure if there is some kind of firewall setting with the software, or if it was just the software itself. ---  --- Anyway, I am unsure whether to reinstall this software or not
Looks like it got squashed a little, and i guess somebody opened the package because i think there was supposed to be a seal there since this is new. But I checked everything inside it counted all of the peices and everything was there. I tried one and its great. This is a good buy for what you get. I just got a Damaged package but its not damaged that badly just the outside is a bit squased. Overhaull 4 stars out of 5 I will buy here again. Fast delivery. Thank
RPG fans won't want to miss this masterful follow-up to the legendary Chrono Trigger on Super NES. Chrono Cross has turned out to be one of those rare gems that manage that have all the qualities needed in order to make a truly memorable role-playing game experience. It does just about everything really well and does many things better than the original ever been did before. If you're a fan of RPGs, there's no doubt that you'll be pleased with this game and owe it to yourself to go out and buy it at your earliest convenience. ---  --- First and foremost, the storyline in Chrono Cross is probably the most ambitious that any has ever been carried out in a console RPG, with the possible exception of Xenogears. The writing quality of Chrono Cross is exceptional and is nearly as good as the brilliant job that was done by the team responsible for Vagrant Story.  ---  --- What makes all of this even more impressive is that Square was able to give each of the game's 40-plus playable characters different characteristics and, in many cases, distinct accents and speech patterns. The accents were handled surprisingly well and most were pretty consistent throughout the entire game. That combined with the fact that each of the characters in the game plays an important role in the plot of the story help brings them to life as individuals.  ---  --- Without spoiling anything, the plot is very elaborate and deals with many issues, such as humanity's role in the destruction of the environment and how fate plays a role in our lives. Plus, it brings forth the idea of parallel worlds and how the outcome of one's life can be greatly effected by what happens during certain significant events in one's life. All of this has been pulled together nicely and the end result is one of the most intricate plots that one will ever encounter in a videogame.  ---  --- Not to be too cliched, but Chrono Cross is a truly epic role-playing game experience that has cemented its place in the annals of RPG history. It's easily one of the best RPGs currently available on PlayStation and has surpassed Vagrant Story as my personal favorite. If you're a fan of role-playing games, then you must go out and buy a copy of Chrono Cross
My son loves this mobile, it is a bit quiet but still keeps his attention and he loves to watch the leaves and animals move around. 
The magazine started being delivered earlier than promised, and it's a much better price than you'll get from SI directly
Had heard other replacement styluses didn't quit fit properly.  These fit my Cingular 8125 perfectly
I really like Bruce Campbell and his movies like Army of Darkness. But this movie is not in the same league. First of all the plot is slow and boring. Bruce does not have the same rouge character that he is so good at. Instead the movie is filled with frankly depressing scenes of him in bed or limping around barely able to move. This really hampers the action aspects of the movie. The dialogue aspect is not much better.  ---  --- If you like Bruce, my advise is to get his other movies or try to get a hold of the TV episodes of  "Jack of all trades" episodes. It is a lot more fun and has the "real" Bruce
I bought this thermometer for my daughter when she was first born. It is AWFUL! It gives strange readings like 94.5 and 95.1, when in fact I know that she has a fever! I bought just a regular digital rectal thermometer at the pharmacy and it gives more accurate readings. Don't buy this, its a waste of time and $$$$$$
This duster is fabulous. Dusting will never be fun, but with this tool it almost IS! As a computer teacher I purchased two. The students even ASKED if they could dust with it. They did a great job on the computer screens, tables, and shelves
This Oregon Scientific Pedometer is very inaccurate and a waste of money even at the cheap price.  There is no point to even considering "saving money" when it comes to pedometers if the count is going to be almost arbitrary
This necklace came exactly as pictured with a nice big blue box to store it in.  I feel it was a great value for the money.  I would recommend purchasing if you like topaz jewelry
I agree that this drive can be a little slow, but it hasn't caused a problem for me. I keep copies of many files (about 1 GB total) related to a large project at work on mine. When I first copied all the files to the drive it took a couple of minutes, but now I just make changes or updates to the individual files and the write times are short enough that I don't even notice them (just a second or two). I also seemlessly work on the files on both a PC at work and a Mac at home.  ---  --- To me the best feature is the reliability. Between my husband and I, we've had several Cruzer Minis in various sizes and each one has worked great, even through accidental abuse. One of his 512 MB drives accidently went through the washing machine. We thought the data was gone, but when it dried out, it worked fine. Just today I found my 2 GB drive at the bottom of the dryer; it had been left in a pocket and had gone through both the washing machine and dryer. Yep, it still worked! I'm buying a new one to replace it (just in case) because I don't know it there might be some long-term effects from the water and heat, but I'll keep using this one for less important applications. Changes are good, though, that it'll never have a problem. These things are amazingly reliable
I was using a basic Linksys wireless game adapter with my 360, and it worked fine. However, it needed to be connected to a PC for firmware updates (making it impossible for Mac users), and was generally more difficult to set up than the "official" adapter from Microsoft.  ---  --- I ended up getting this adapter on sale, and setting it up was a snap. It gets decent throughput, and saves some energy over an external adapter, because it only uses power when you have the Xbox 360 on. It was also nice to see that this supports WPA networks.  ---  --- If your time is valuable to you, this is probably worth the extra few dollars over similar products. You just snap it on, enter your network's password, and you're off.
I was wrong. Ok, I've admitted it. I always thought science fiction or futuristic type novels weren't my cup of tea. While reading Conspiracy in Death I realized I couldn't have been more wrong - I love this futuristic series!  ---  --- A homeless man is murdered and the case is assigned to Eve Dallas, since it's not a random act of violence. This man, Snooks, died when his heart was surgically removed by what appeared to be a very skilled surgeon. When Dallas digs a bit further, she discovers that this crime is connected to another committed in New York City where an aged LC (licensed companion) died as the result of her liver being removed. After even more digging, Dallas discovers a case in Chicago and one abroad that were all similar.  ---  --- These were not the result of black market organ sales since all of the victims were within a few months of dying. In order for Eve Dallas to find the murderer she had to figure out why these victims were chosen. The closer she got to that answer, the more nervous very influential politicians and doctors became.  ---  --- When she got too close to the truth, the villain had to put a stop to her investigation. The best way to get Dallas off the case was to have her suspended from the police department. This was a simple procedure since there was a conflict between the patrol officer who discovered Snook's body and Dallas. When that patrolwoman was brutally murdered suspicion fell on Dallas. Stripped of her badge and weapon, the very items that have been the heart and sole of her during her adult life, she has to deal with not only the idea of not being a police detective, but also with trying to solve this crime having her hands tied.  ---  --- The main plot was interesting but the villain was predictable and no surprise. There was excellent character development and as usual J.D. Robb (AKA Nora Roberts) draws the reader into the suspense to the point of not being able to put down the book. What makes this book above average and falling into the excellent range is the fantastic subplot of Eve Dallas being stripped of her identity as a policewoman and how she must deal with the various facets of that. At times, it was more intense and more exciting that the main plot.  ---  --- This is definitely one to read, as all of the "In Death" series books have been. Start with the first book when reading because J.D. Robb always has a couple of instances where she reflects on previous happenings. Or you can start with the first book just because it's the beginning of an excellent adventure!
I loved this magazine in 1995, until a few years ago.  They have changed editors a few times and now it is not even worth reading the ads. ---  --- No new information.  Glossy pics of models with bright red lips.  What is about health here? ---  --- Get Life Extension magazine and Alternative Medicine Magazine.  They've changed too over the last few years, but still a far sight better than this one
I am a busy architect and this is the 2nd pair of Clics I own.   --- If you are active and need reading glasses they are perfect. --- Their only drawback is that they take two hands to put on!  I'd  --- look at slimming down the frames to make them less heavy and trimmer. --- Lastly ~ I've found these readers to be really rugged and good for outdoor use
1st of all I am sure that everyone has hated how ugly the winter wiper blades are, they are bulky, and just do not look good.  Now the ICONS are sleek and small, they look great!  They perform awesome in all weather conditions(I have used them in rain, sleet, and snow, and in a blizzard) they handle everything perfectly.  No annoying streaks, and they sweep everything away, the do not miss anything!!  Sure they are more expensive than other blades, but you really do get what you pay for!  Awesome wiper blades I would recommend them to EVERYONE
I enjoyed most of this movie and applaud its central message: that kids (and people) rise to meet expectations, and that the socioeconomically disadvantaged are not necessarily lacking in intelligence but only in resources and opportunities.   ---  --- However I found the movie not entirely satisfying because it does not really show just HOW Jaime Escalante turned these kids around, other than being creative, charismatic and persistent.  As a former teacher myself of high school kids from a similar background as the ones portrayed in this movie, I know firsthand that what Escalante achieved is not impossible but it's not quite so clean and simple as shown here, but is extremely hard grueling work that often entails breaking through a lot of the students' ingrained patterns and applying a lot of painstaking coercion. The director, Ramon Menendez, seems to present a fairly sanitized  and glib version that glosses over a lot of the underlying social problems that are endemic to the urban poor while sometimes relying on some stock movie cliches (the tough guy who's really a softie at heart, the big seemingly dumb lunk, etc.). ---  --- In short, "Stand and Deliver" lacks the kind of rawness, grit and ballsiness that could've made it more than just another well-meaning, triumphant and feel-good movie.  It could have been a movie that asks questions instead of spooning out pat answers. ---  --- It's too bad a real master like Martin Scorsese did not direct this one
This is a great toy for my baby to play with in his high chair while he's waiting for breakfast. There are lots of things to shake, spin and rattle. The suction actually works and they stay on his tray unless he pulls really hard. Also,it's very durable because he's dropped it about a hundred times on a tile floor and it hasn't broken yet! At first I wasn't crazy about the fact that the 'cow over the moon' toy doesn't play but one verse at a time with each press of the button because he was only hearing the first verse but in no time at all my baby learned that if he wanted to hear the rest of the song he needed to push the button. Now he does it on his own and hears the whole song. I think that's great. I would recommend this set to anyone.
MariaS and Srayle, if you like the Guaraldi original then keep it and chuck the Winston,  Personally, I think the Winston performance is refreshing and a delightful 'twist' on Guaraldi's works.  The piano is brillaint sounding and at volume, thru a good system sounds like there's a piano in the room.  It should be emphatically understood, you are buying Winston in this case, and not Guaraldi.  I have both versions
Probably a very good case, but not a very operatable one in the field - you have to undo two closures to open the camera compartment, a strap and a velcro.  The shoulder strap is not detachable - looks kind of silly when you are trying to use the belt strap.  For the Olympus Stylus digital cameras, look to the Lowepro case - better case and value
I have been using Kodak cameras for years. This is my third Kodak digital camera. It does everything, including taking excellent close-up wildlifephotos. It is as easy to use as a point and shoot. However, it does have all the bells and whistles needed for a professional style camera. It is well worth the money. Look no further this is the camera for you
I bought this set for my son prior to reading the other reviews online but before I tried to set it up. I will admit in reading the reviews about how difficult some people thought it was to put together that they must be exaggerating...we'll apparently they were not.  I tried for 10 minutes and was covered in soap and nearly hurt myself trying to get the first two pieces together...so at that point I gave up and waited for my husbands help. The two of us spent nearly an hour banging the thing together with every tool we had(after we washed off all the soap b/c that just made getting the pieces to stay together impossible)and once we had the center base up I pushed it and it fell completely apart.  We got it back together but there was no way I felt it was sturdy enought to let my child anywhere near it.  So in desperation I called the ToysRUs store where I got it and spoke w/ the store manager. She assured me that this was not how it was supposed to be and that I should bring it back.  I wasnt thrilled about that b/c it wasnt the easiest thing to get home in the first place...but what choice did I have. I asked her if they would set the next one up for me to make sure it worked b/c I wasn't about to go through this again.  When I arrived at the store it was all set up and completely sturdy...exactly what I had wanted it to be when I had purchased it. Unfortunatly due to its size we had to take it back apart to get it home but once we did my husband had it back together in about 10-15 minutes with just a little banging from a rubber mallett...just like some of the other reviewers had said.  So the morale of the story is...if its miserable to put together then its probably defective and should go back...but once its together properly its great....now if my son would just show some interest in the darn thing all would be good with the world!
I remember hearing about this book by the great patriot Sean Hannity sometime in 2001, then it was a mere idea. From that time on, until August 20th 2002, I waited for what I thought would be the greatest book of all time. I remember seeing the cover art and hearing about the title: "Let Freedom Ring" with not just a picture of Sean Hannity on the cover, patriot that he is, but also a flag. I loved it, couldn't be more happy. ---  --- Well, the day of the book's release, I took a day off work (i've never missed a day of work before in my life), and rushed to get this book. It looked better than I ever imagined. ---  --- With the flag on the cover and the title of "Let Freedom Ring," I thought, finally, technology has caught up to our patriotism. I expected a book filled with flags, flags with sound effects. Maybe some firework sound effects.  ---  --- Boy was I wrong. I opened the book only to the colors black and white. No red. No blue. No stars and stripes. I quickly turned the pages, looking, searching for flags. I found none, no sound effects either, no fireworks.  ---  --- At that point, I went into a 4 year long depression. I nearly committed suicide at several points. It's only now that I can bring myself to review this man's book, patriot that he is.  ---  --- I say this so you know what you're getting yourself into. There are no flags, no stars and stripes, no fireworks, no sound effects.  ---  --- I have since recovered, but only because of old stars and stripes. I went back to teaching last year, not fully recovered, and my colleagues, knowing how much I love America and the STARS AND STRIPES, suggested I have my class do a research project: find the most patriotic book ever made.  ---  --- The methodoloy was simple: A book made out of flags with flag pictures would score high, a book that was not made out of a flag or flags and had no pictures of flags would score the lowest.  ---  --- We found some very good books and they did cheer me up. The one that was the most patriotic by far was a book called "President Jesus: How Jesus Wrote the Constitution, Freed the Slaves, and Won World War II." Its published by a small church in Texas. I was very proud of my students for finding it. It has brought countless joy to my life. Along with the book, made entirely out of a flag, with flag pictures, and written in blue and red ink, you get a giant flag. I'm not sure of the dimensions, but they had to haul it to my house in a moving truck. I've draped it over my house and it covers it completely. People even have to crawl under the flag to enter the house.  ---  --- Now I often go outside and just gaze at old stars and stripes for hours at a time, smiling.
Like the powder blush, this eye shadow is silky not chalky.  It goes on sheer and looks natural but beautiful.  All of the colors I've tried are very nice.  Toasted Almond is a wonderful ivory.  American Coffee is a rich brown (but doesn't go on too dark -- you can layer it for more drama), Caramel is a creamy beige.   --- This is a great product for everyday. --- NOTE:  You will need an eye shadow brush for this just as you need a blush brush -- it does not come with one
Its good for waking up, because once you put it on you feel refreshed because your lips feel on fire.I like the sting and  the shine of it. It finishes pretty fast and the roll ball may feel like a little drag to keep rolling on the lips, but i think it's worth trying it unless you have extreme sensitive lips, this stuff is strong. Did i mention the great smell? Yum! Me and my boyfriend loved it.
We had the Diaper Dekor Plus and it seems that I'm the only reviewer here so far that has had a terrible problem with it having a bad smell.  The first couple of months weren't bad, but after about 3 months or so, it really started to smell bad.  This horrid smell only got worse with use as time went on. ---  --- We tried everything we could think of to get rid of the smell-letting it "air out" outside, cleaning it with bleach or some other cleaning solution, putting baking soda in the bottom of the liner and even leaving a small box of baking soda inside the can but outside the liner, letting it soak in a bathtub of soap and water...we even bought some scented disc type things (can be purchased at Babies R Us) that you can put in the bottom and it only made the smell worse. ---  --- We continued to use it, but frequently had to let it air out or spray it with Lysol or something.  Eventually we used it less and less, and we just threw it away when we moved to a new home a few weeks ago-we'd had it for almost 2 years.  We knew there was no way anyone else would want to use it with that smell and knowing they couldn't get rid of it.  It was a real shame because aside from the smell, it was a great product
It was suprisingly easy for me to put together considering I'm a 110lb girl. It only took about 3 hours but i did have trouble getting all the screws to get into their proper holes. It is slightly rickitty however I can go as fast as i want to and it won't brake or anything. It really is nice to be able to lose 200 calories while you watch your favorite T.V. shows.  Also, I am very tall and I had plenty of space, and it's nice to have the handle bars in the front and on either side.  ---  --- If you are looking for a reasonably priced bike that won't brake on you, Marcy is a good choice
I just bought a 25 pack of these along with my new liteon dvd burner.  To bad only half of the cd players in my house can even read them.  I dont' think its the lightscribe side thats causing the problem as it doesn't seem to matter if I "lightscribe" them or not. ---  --- The burner works fine with all of the other media I've tried so I'd avoid these discs like the plague
I didn't have a ton of time to research this flash. I've used it now on several occasions with my Canon 5D and couldn't be happier with it. It's great for shooting portraits. I can shoot 10 shots in a row and the flash keeps up. I would definitely purchase the plastic diffuser - get's rid of the typical flash harsh light
This is a great film with a bad guy that you root for from start to finish.  Action packed, and very smart.  Great cast too
I recently bought a pair of the reflector cover from photoblocker store on Amazon.  After I put it on my plates I have been through several red light intersections in the evenings on numerous occasions and to date I have yet to receive a fine, I believe the reflector cover has already paid for itself.
My 4-yr old daughter really wanted this for Christmas, and Santa was kind enough to bring it for her.  The quality is fine, but it just doesn't do much.  She played with it for the first day, and has touched it maybe twice since.  I've seen these on clearance everywhere I've gone lately, too.  If your child is into playing "mommy", this is cute, but the extra money you pay for something that moves and talks doesn't really equate to lasting play value with this one
I love my new stroller.  I also have a Graco travel system.  The Graco was just way to big and heavy for me to handle.  I think the Peg steers very well, unlike what some other reviewers have said.  I even set up an obtacle course in the store I bought it at to make sure that I could steer it one handed with my 1yr old in it.  It handled like a dream.  My husband and I went to the mall last weekend and were waiting for an elevator, instead of waiting in the long line, my husband carried our 1yr old, and I carried the stroller up the stairs while it was fully opened.  It was a breeze!  We did the same thing when we left the mall, only this time I collasped the stroller, the carrying handle on it makes it super easy to carry up or down stairs.  It's still winter, so I haven't had much of a chance to test out the sun shade, but hopefully that will work out ok.  I would reccomend this stroller to anyone, infact I've told two of my girlfriends about it, and they have already added it to their gift registry.  You will be happy with this stroller
My first pregnancy I tried several styles of belts, most of which had a wide band in back. I am short, have a short midriff, and am overweight, so wider belts would roll from the top down.  I never had that problem with this belt.  Unfortunately, this pregnancy I am entering my 3rd trimester and have finally out grown the 1X belt, and the store I purchased it from is now closed.  I was thrilled when I found this on Amazon.com in a larger size.   ---  --- I recommend making it little snug in the mornings and then loosening it throughout the day as needed.  The most appealing feature for me is that this band is completely adjustable to give you the support you need for the different activities you will be doing throughout the day.  Any time you start needing the extra support, just slightly tighten the side straps.  When you start relaxing or if the belt starts feeling a little tight, just loosen it up a bit.  It's quick and easy to work with, and if one side needs more support than the other, just make that one side a bit more snug.  It's AWESOME! ---  --- I am a technology education specialist, so I'm on my feet for, many times, 16 hrs a day training and supporting hospitals with their new computer programs.  I couldn't have survived even my First Trimester without this belt.  I raise it a little higher in the back so that I have complete lower back support and belly support.  There were days when I forgot to wear my belt that I almost couldn't walk after only 4 hrs of work due to lower back pain that would eventually extend down to my fanny and legs.  My legs would litterally give out from underneath me until I could rub and relax my lower back for a while.  When you are working with doctors in the surgery room or doing rounds with them this is NOT a good thing.  As long as I wore my belt, I NEVER had a problem.   ---  --- I strongly recommend this product
I've owned the T9 now for just about 3 weeks.  I purchased it after some extensive research.  Of course you never really know a product until you've had it awhile.  Here's my thumb nail opinion. --- I like: --- The ultra thin metal body --- Optical image stabilizer --- great photo quality --- high ISO performance --- large, high rez screen --- Auto focus assist lamp works well --- very fast start-up --- fast recovery even after flash --- lots of built in memory, but you need to buy the 1 or 2 gig card --- ok slide show feature with music ---  --- I don't like: --- Redeye doesn't work that well --- Too few manual controls --- needs white balance --- needs long shutter speed modes --- Chews up battery time pretty fast. Already ordered a second battery. --- No optical viewfinder (most ultra smalls don't) --- flimsy plastic cover over the battery will be first thing to break ---  --- All in all a great little camera.  Takes awesome, clear pics.  Not for the professional photographer, but that's not why you are considering it (I hope). 
This is the worst holiday movie in America! I mean if you buy this product you'll face torture (as in singing horribly.) Making friends as the movie says is not the most important thing in the world in my belief. They also said that "If you want, wish for fairy tales and it will come true." Right. Some fairy tales are gruesome (for example this one fairy tale is so gruesome because it has fairies heads cut off.) Eeww! The voice talents are very annoying. Better save your money when you buy a christmas movie
I was happy with the noise canceling features, not the best but definitely works.  Great for airplane rides - really helps cut out that background engine noise.  My problem however with these headphones hwoever is the design - the first set i had brok near the earpiece hinge and was replaced by Targus (cheers to them).  the second set broke too in a different place - the deisgn of these just isn't very sturdy.  I'm gentle with my stuff too, so either I had bad luck w/two defective units or they're just not made well
As a casual piano player and a Broadway fanatic, I was so jazzed to play some of the songs from Avenue Q. The book contains everything you find on the CD and includes a few production photos. --- Of course the little details are fun, using terms like "manilowesque" "Huey-Lewis shuffle" "prissy sonata" and "funky a** groove" to describe some of the songs. Fun fun fu
My new Shoe Wallet is even better than I expected!  It securely fastens to my running shoe; holds my key, emergency cash, and identification; and most importantly, serves as a safe place for my iPod Sport Sensor.  Best of all, my iPod works efficiently and accurately in the Shoe Wallet without my purchasing Nike-branded shoes. --- I'm a very happy consumer!
4 different methods to learn the language, I am able to do 2 lessons an evening one to repeat and one new. The only thing you have to do is sit in fron of the computer. Just listen and look and the key words will pop out at you and you just can not help but to learn the new language. ---  --- Very user friendly
After playing this game for the third time I had a thought, 'WHY DID I BUY THIS!' This game is extremely unoriginal and gets boring very quickly. I cannot notice any difference and improvements from the first ballers and other NBA Street's. Save your money and do not purchase this dreadful game
The Mac OS, $129 list, often cheaper, doesn't get viruses, worms, malware, etc and probably runs all the software you do on a PC, with the exception of some games. Go to a Mac Store and try it for yourself
The only refined sugar in this brownie mix is in the chocolate chips; otherwise, it's naturally sweetened. And it's easier to put together than are the mundane supermarket brands: add one egg, butter or oil (or applesauce, if you're an oil-free person), and a little water. Throw it in a 350-degree oven for 20 minutes. That's it. ---  --- I'm an active home cook and a rather intense one (we make our own vanilla, roast our own coffee beans), so it's no surprise that I'd say the results aren't as good as homemade. But they are _very_ good. And I could put the mix together between innings while watching a baseball game. How's _that_ for easy? ---  --- I'll be making this mix again
This is a classic style work boot which used to be a lot more common than now, even appearing in one episode of "Leave It To Beaver" in the late '50s, and on the cover of one of Simon and Garfunkles albums of the late '60s. I've owned several pair of similar boots by other makers, including Red Wing. Some comments which apply to this style in general, (and not just Wolverines): Pros - The wedge sole absorbs a lot of shock making them great for standing/working on concrete, or walking long distances on hard surfaces. Also, the non-agressive tread means that dirt and grass doesn't track into the house after doing chores outside. The moc toe tends to breath through the seams, so feet tend to stay cooler and drier in hot, dry conditions. A great boot for the desert, and apparantly highly esteemed by many construction workers.  --- Cons - The wedge sole doesn't offer much traction for serious hiking on steep, loose surfaces (which I've used them for, but for which they really weren't intended). Gravel will roll right out from under them. None of the several brands I have owned were water-resistant at all. Walking through wet grass will lead to wet socks very quickly, as the seams around the toe which allow air and perspiration to escape also allow outside moisture to enter just as easily. We used to say "Your feet get wet two days BEFORE it rains". So, perhaps not the best choice for hiking in the Pacific Northwest. --- Specifically, the Wolverines were extemely comfortable right out of the box. They have a better insole than any of my previous boots of this style, a removeable polyurethane contoured cushion which provides good arch support. The color was actually more of a brown clay, rather than what I would call tan. The quality of workmanship appeared to be pretty good, actually better looking stitching than my Red Wings. However I was disappointed in the variable nature of the leather. The leather in most of the boot appeared to be adequately thick, however the leather used in the shaft around the ankles was thinner than I have ever seen in any work boot, thinner even than in many suede sneakers. While my ankles were covered, they didn't feel at all supported or protected. --- After considering for a couple of days, I decided to return the boots to the merchant who provided them for Amazon, The Sportsmans Guide. They had provided a return shipping label in the box, so I taped the box closed, applied the label, and took it to the Post Office. I received an email a few days later acknowledging their receipt of the package, and a notice of a credit applied to my account. --- So, while I'm not very excited about the particular pair of boots which I received, I do give good marks to Sportsmans Guide for a quick and relatively painless return.  ---  I ended up purchasing the Georgia SPR 6" Farm and Ranch boot, with wedge sole, also available through Amazon. For further details, please see my review
I got this phone as part of a buy-one-get one free promotion. I changed from Cingular because I couldn't stand my bill being constantly wrong. The i560 seemed like a good choice at first. However, it is not as resilient as advertised. Within the first two months, my phone already malfunctioned. While talking to my wife on the phone, the phone went wacky and the pound sign appeared on my screen. Next, all I could hear was the sound of someone holding down a phone key. I was not even touching the phone. The phone did not respond to any keystrokes or even the command to turn off. Once I removed the battery and placed it back into the phone, the phone restarted and went directly into Airplane Mode. This is the most annyoing features of this phone and I wish you could disable it altogether. My wife's phone had to be replaced by the vendor where we got our phone. Mine is currently on its way to Motorola to be repaired.  ---  --- Caveat Emptor!
The Fridays gang steals some diamonds.  Mike Epps is not Chris Tucker no matter how hard he tries to be.  His constant whinning is enough to ride my last nerve.  Plus, everything about the movie is just campy and just wholly unbelieveable that I don't know where to begin.  Whatever you do don't buy or rent this garbage-wait to catch it on TBS or something
I just ordered the world of little people sweet sounds from amazon. I haven't received it yet. I paid $200.00 for it. Now I can see it's selling for $139.00. I've also seen it for $32.00. What's going on. Is there a difference in sets? I'm not sure, but I think I acted too quickly. Can anyone tell me if there is a difference in the doll houses? Did I make a big mistake
We got this when our baby was about 6 months old, he is now 9 months.  At first, he wasn't sure what to do, but once he figured out how to jump in it, it was all he wanted to do.  The adults all get such a kick watching him go crazy in it.  It's a little awkward to move around, but the enjoyment well out-weighs that.
Quick shipping - I received this bike in 4 days (using free super saver shipping) and it was even over a holiday!  The bike comes in one large box with MANY pieces.  My husband and father put the bike together in less than 1 hour.  It looked a little overwhelming at first but was quite easy to assemble.  The bike is very compact and easily placed in small areas.  It is also very quiet - you have to listen closely to even hear the bike. ---  --- The resistance goes from 1 to 8 (one being the easiest to eight being the hardest).  My husband is an avid road biker and 8 could be too easy for someone looking for a really hard ride (like riding the equivalent of up-hill). ---  --- The bike offers basic functions that are displayed very large.  The display is easily toggled through.  The heart rate monitor picks up okay, but don't buy the bike based off of that function because it's not totally reliable. ---  --- All in all, a great buy!  I injured my back and was looking for a workout that would be good on my back.  The seat is uncomfortable (and I am petite- I would imagine it would be very uncomfortable if someone was larger.  But for the price, you can't beat it
This is such a great product for nursing moms. It is not bulky and is reliable to keep leaks from happening. For a mom, this was a lifesaver for me to allow me to go outside without being embarassed by having a wet shirt
Our book club read this book for our February 2006 selection.  It was a really good book, we were all excited about discussing it.  Mr. Johnson sent us discussion questions that really made us think. ---  --- A few members felt that Denmark never loved Sierra but saw her more as property.  The book definitely has some suprises that you don't see coming.  We really enjoyed the book. ---  --- Sistahs of Ebony Pages
I remember listning to this album over and over again when I was young. To this day I still can't get these awesome songs out of my head! A must get album for you Old School folks or anyone that enjoys great music
This album is disgusting. --- No musical talent.  This people are the farthest thing from musicians.  If you enjoy overproduced music, and a rip off of fellow label mates FOB and P!ATD - buy this.  It is boring and it is a weak attempt at a record.  Shaant can't sing either.  Go back to Buffalo
This is one program that in my opinion you get more than what you pay for I have several Immaging programs that I use for several different things. This one is a delight to use and does a great job taking most of the work off the user. Its a microsoft program that is very user friendly and easy to use. However you do have to be some what computer savy, (like know where to turn on the computer kind of thing) not like some of the 1 star comments that were made here by other folks. I would recomend it to all people that need a simple to use program. Its not what you pay for something its what you do with it after you get it
I've been kinda exclusive to Remington MS3's for a few years. They've just been had inexpensively here and there so that's the main reason I've stuck it out. But in all honesty, these seem to cost me more than I've thought in the past. ---  --- Like other reviews have stated, this razor takes effort to get close. Hair does collect on the foils and thus as I've noticed, causes the blades to bind on stubble. I'm a patient person, not usually in a hurry to shave, so again not too big a deal after a quick cleaning. ---  --- But here's the weakness: the foils are like paper, and flake holes in them. ---  --- I just purchased the 2700 right before the holidays for about 25 bucks (a good deal I thought for a microscreen 3). My other 0003 was shot and running on a foil or two (once a hole developed, and I'd rashed up my neck accidentally, I removed the bad foil). I'd bought one foil pack before and gradually went through those. So I thought a new unit was the trick. ---  --- Well, now just three months later, the new 2700 has burned through two foils and is down to two (used a foil from the 0003 when the first went out). My bathroom is riddled with these things. My patience is now out and I'm headed back to an old faithful: Braun
I've been a long time user of Trend Micro's PCcillin but after reading poor reviews on their latest version I decided I didn't want to take a chance on it so I went looking for different anti-virus software. I stumbled onto this ZoneAlarm (piece of junk) and after reading mostly wonderful reviews I down loaded their trial.  It didn't seem too bad. After a few weeks I bought this 3 computer suite and installed it. I went a while longer and notice my computer's performance was not as good as it was. I downloaded upgrades and uninstalled old versions and installed new.  Now after about a month my computer is practically unusable (as well as the kid's - they have been screaming about slow computer since the start).   --- This zonealarm is the worst software I have ever used.  It hogs CPU and memory.  It gets the CPU usage to 80 - 100% and it doesn't free it up.  I shut down all programs and CPU just keeps churning away. The interesting thing is that at times I would check task manager processes and system idle would be 90% but when you check the performance tab the CPU chart would be near 100%?  Go figure! I finally said enough and uninstalled it (and deleted every occurrence of zonealarm out of the registry) and downloaded Trend Micro's pccillin.  It's installed and I got my old machine back.  Log-ins take 40 seconds were they would take over 3 minutes with ZA.  CPU is back to normal.  You couldn't give me this cr*ppy software.  I wish I would have stuck with pccillin and saved the $40
This is beautiful birdbath.  If placed on solid ground (walkway, concrete) it will be great. However, if placed in mulch or in the landscape it is not weighted heavily on the bottom.  A wind will not send it sailing but will cause it to tip.  However, it is beautiful and looks great while it is upright.  I am still trying to figure out how to stabilize in the landscape mulch
Eternity was signature scent of the late 80's early 90's and has been around long enough to gain a rightful, classic status now. --- It is one of the best on the market, it smells classy, clean, zingy and has more than a touch of the erotic about it. --- Always worth having a bottle handy even if you don't wear it everyday, it is a yummy, scrummy scent
 I requested this book for my college music class. I saw many offers from b&n and other book stores and I found amazon having the best price and received the book on time. the book was in great condition and my fellow students were surprised when they heard the price and the shipping response. i totally recommend this site and book for school. The book was comprehensible and well illustrated.
I Love this story for my Boys. It is now a story I put on for my Grandson. It keeps their attention and there is always something going on. I do wish that the few Cuss words that were put in this movie had been ommitted. You should explain that this has nothing to do with your Religous Beliefs. It is really entertaining. I Love the Bird and I Love the Song Bright Eyes. I would recommed this for anyone 8 and up. I don't think girls care for it as much as boys.
People were talking about this movie as if it were the next Silence Of The Lambs.  There are several reasons why this is not so. ---  --- 1. The Dumbest Cop In The World:  This character never calls for backup, and is too slow to think of the most obvious clues.  At the end, he even throws down his gun to have a fist fight.  He'd never survive on the Sopranos. --- 2. It's sooooooo 1998.  This movie assumes you know nothing about the internet.   --- 3. It tries to be cool by combining BDSM, body modification, and rituals, but in the end it just makes all these things look bad. --- 4. It's inconsistent.  The Dee Snider character "retires" all his piercings for a few years, and then suddenly they're all back in the next scene.   --- 5. It's unrealistic.  Where the heck did Snider get that second dungeon from in just a day? --- 6. I won't even get into the gaping plot holes. ---  --- The acting, pretty bad.  The dumbest cop in the world character has just one mood:  Grumpy.  Amy Smart is totally wasted in this movie.  Snider's pretty good though.  Actually he's really good. ---  --- Really, bottom line:  You have only two reasons to buy this movie. --- 1. You are easily entertained and you have no problem with plot holes so big you can drive a Twisted Sister tour bus through them with room to spare. --- 2. You're a Snider fan and you must own this. ---  --- If you belong to one of those two groups, go for it.  For Sister fans, they'll enjoy how the movie roughly follows the plot of the song Captain Howdy/Street Justice.   ---  --- You've been warned! 
I lived in Japan for many years & really enjoyed using these "noodles" in soups, stir-fry, Korean-style cooking, etc.  If you are looking for pasta, these may not exactly match your craving, but are nonetheless really versatile!  My advice for those who don't like the smell upon opening the package is to drain them, sprinkle liberally with salt & rub through with clean hands, then rinse in cold water.  This is how they prepare them in Japan - it removes any odor & they are ready to use
This foam product by Jonathan is okay.  The reviews on his products are highly overrated.  The price doesn't bother me at all.  There are better foams for thin and limp hair
I gave these slippers to my mother for Christmas and they do not hold up well.  The first pair came apart in the wash and the second pair hasn't been washed yet, but they're already coming apart also.  Not a good buy.
I sorta of agree with the person below, This album sucks....plain and simple, however I think he is still doing a great job in Rhapsody.  I gave it one star not so much because it is garbage, but becuase I was looking forward to this album since "Prophets of the Last Eclipse"  Which was great, but trully...I don't know went wrong.  I don't have a problem with female vocalists, but in this album...it is retched.  I don't think I will ever listen to this album ever again.  Sorry!  But its true...do not buy this album, pretend you never knew he had a new album...OH!  and do NOT buy Luca Turilli's Dreamquest either!  Another bomb
There's not much I can say about this item. It works, and that's all I really care about. No leaks, it's never cracked, and it's stood up to some serious abuse.
I bought this game based on the reviews on Amazon and I am not disappointed.  Even my three year old enjoys this game and is capable of understanding the concept.  The beginner puzzles are right up his alley and the expert puzzles are challenging enough for me. 
Actually, I would give the product 5 stars, and the packaging a minus-2. CityLips really does work, plumping and hydrating; it does required repeated applications. BUT the packaging results in about 10-12% of the (expensive) material being completely unavailable!  Worse, if you try to wiggle the (too-short) applicator in order to get the last 10%, the container breaks at the neck (actually, one came already cracked in my case!).  True, they do offer some colors at 2/3 price, but most effective is to apply clear, and go outside the lipline-and the clear almost never has gone on sale! 
Although the description of these booties says they run true to size, they do not! I ordered a full size and a half larger than my daughter's regular shoe size and they were still too small for her to put on her feet. Now I have to pay more shipping for an exchange. Not a great transaction experience
I have seen some really dumb things in my 46 years but this flashlight is near the top of the list.  A flashlight whose power reserve lasts only 30 minutes after 15 hours spent charging.  Sad thing is after not much more than 3 minutes the flashlight is down to half brightness.  8 minutes after turning it on the light it gives out is useless such that you would do better turning this flashlight off allowing your eyes to adjust to the darkness at least you will see more than what you did with this lame light.  I have heard some wild stories but the reality of this flashlight has me thinking the people who made this monstrosity are quite totally and completely insane living in fantasy land. ---  --- This flashlight is what you buy when you just want a prop to take up space and look good because as a tool for illuminating space it is totally, utterly and profoundly useless.  Your Good Money invested in this flashlight instantly becomes money wasted with no hope of any meaningful return whatsoever.  Don't say we did not warn you!  This flashlight should have a sign on it that says I am awesomely pathetic buy at your own risk! --- 
Blatant sentimentality without any touch of irony or wit = Elefant's lyrics.  I personally like Interpol and the Strokes; I resent that they are being compared to these cheeseballs
This study of the intertwined lives of the sculptor Rodin and the artist who loved him with a fatal passion is quite extraordinary. Long a student of modern art, I learned a great deal from this film that had been unknown to me before. Furthermore the film is compelling as a work of art itself, and enormously important to the on-going study of women artists.  ---  --- This is a work all admirers of modern art should view
I was excited to purchase what I thought was a quality knife for a good price with good ergonomics, being a Ken Onion design.  What I bought was designed to sell and not to last.  The handle was textured on the sides, but the edges of the handle were far too smooth to be held safely, especially if they were to ever get a little wet.  The thumb studs have very sharp edges that will wear out pants quickly.  The spring-assist broke after two months of extremely mild, absolutely non-abusive use. --- The $12.00 return shipping fee plus the cost to ship it to Emerson makes the true cost of the knife about $84.00...and what if the spring breaks again?  My advice is buy another brand. --- P.S.  The only reason I give it 2 stars instead of 1 is the tanto blade and the fact that it can still be used as a quick-opening folder, absent the "blur."
I too, loved the camera, despite the small LCD screen size, until it got the infamous White Screen of Death that this particular camera is known for, which usually occurs AFTER the warranty expires (1 year).  Photos outside are great, poor low-light photos though, but I paid $100 for it (and with $20 coupon it was $80).  Small LCD screen means that it takes less battery power, so the rechargeable AA batteries lasted a long time.   ---  --- White screen of death temporary solution:  Turn the camera off, and do a quick rap with your knuckles to the "Cybershot" logo on the front of the camera.  Then turn it back on.  Repeat if necessary.  It'll probably happen again, but it beats buying a brand new camera if you're on vacation and don't have time to bargain shop
Although the compartments seem small, you can fit lots of food into this bowl. It's divided into about 4 or 5 sections, so you can separate your veggies, meat, etc. The only thing that bummed me out was the ice pack - the frozen gel expanded on the inside and caused the container to break :( So, I use it to store food in the fridge. I have all of the other Fit & Fresh containers and none of the ice packs on those have broken.
Product arrived damaged.  Company (ANTOnline)was unwilling to exchange for new item.  Would never buy from them again
The "crema" was pretty thick as it brewed, and the coffee appeared to have a nice dark color. We got a nice strong aroma of coffee and preceded to add some milk (1%) and sugar.  ---  --- Our first impressions...good flavor...a nice cup of coffee. We did enjoy the cup of coffee ---  --- We don't know of any other pod maker that has this flavor and it's really good! We love the way it smells - the way it tastes - and the fact it is just plain different. Most pod people are ignoring the flavored sector to this extent - and it's nice to have a cup of really flavored coffee! Review from singleservecoffee.com --- 
No, this game isn't perfect - you'll be annoyed by the dialogue (luckily you can fast forward through it) and the cut scenes (unfortunately you CAN'T fast forward through those).  BUT it's filled with tons of things to solve, and if you get stuck, you can have the game solve it for you.  This game will keep you busy for a while...but fair warning, it's CORNY
Good Magazine for the Married over 50 group, Which represents 90.5% --- Of The Retired Travelers
As a student of urban development and politics, I can confidently say that this book is a forgettable work of a parochial mind. Davis offers a hardline Marxist view of Los Angeles that, by employing simply economic analysis, does not allow for the intricacies of the city's problems. Class warfare plays a much smaller role in the sprawl of Los Angeles -- anyone outside of the ISO should be discouraged from reading this baseless drivel
This is a very cute and realistic set.  The measurements are all accurate.  The whisk is very DANGEROUS though.  It is metal.  One of the "things" came out of the handle and stuck out like a weapon.  One of the kids could have been severely injured had I not found it and thrown it away.  If you buy this item, make sure get rid of the whisk!
When I rented Twentynine Palms, I knew it would showcase Bruno Dumont's taste for dispassionate portrayals, violence of various sorts, and shock. In spite of this mental preparation, this very atmospheric film built to a grotesque resolution that left me, a seasoned viewer, rattled. Unfortunately, the shock and awe that the film achieves is short lived. Twentynine Palms is modeled on the horror film, but, like many of its American cousins, the horror it achieves failed to haunt me. The film as a whole left me with an unsettled feeling, as if a cynic had just talked my ear off.  I also had the sense that this was more about the worldview of the director, rather than the world his film creates. ---  --- Sam Peckinpaw's STRAW DOGS is in ways a similar but superior film. I can admire STRAW DOGS based on its many strengths, so long as I avoid viewing it as the MAN-AS-ANIMAL fable that Peckinpaw intended. It isn't that I disagree with his view of humans as domesticated animals. I see the film as a rare example of violent drama and technical virtuosity transcending the simplicity of its maker's defense. Whether Peckinpaw has a point or not seems beside the point. Of course, the trick with any argument is in having good evidence. In pressing one's point of view, there is, almost inevitably, an artful description of a scene, one that reflects the viewer's position. In this way, films have the strange ability to create their own myths; their own arguments. To invest a film with one's views too forcibly can dull the work's independent life, its peculiar logic, with the sententiousness of fables.  ---  --- Watching Twentynine Palms, it seems impossible to avoid questioning Dumont's personal views. This is because so many of the events described in the film are implausible. Lacking believable characters and action, one naturally develops a sense that the director is revealing something to us that we haven't seen; something unique to his vision. If the strange behavior of the two principles was about their uniqueness and their relationship (e.g. as outsiders) then why would Dumont undercut their characterization, denying us a belief in them as individuals, or, more profoundly, as points of identification? I gradually came to view the two principles as an every-couple, with private rhythms and misunderstandings that might appear absurd if made public. This seemed like a worthy focus, but Dumont forces it to play against a theme of violence, both seen and unseen. The violent atmosphere of the film was something I couldn't account for until the resolution, and even then with difficulty.  ---  --- Toward the end of film, we're given a horrific equation of two orgasms: that of the male protagonist and that of his rapist, the film's principle antagonist (aside from the desert). Both orgasms are shown to be dangerous, powerful, and unspeakable (or, at least, not clearly worded). This equation discounts the context in which the orgasms occur, leaving the viewer with no reliable distinction of the protagonists from their insanely hostile environment. Clearly, the bourgeois, carefree lifestyle of the couple is set up to be cut down (a horror convention), but Dumont makes the attack personal in the most perverse way. From early in the film on, the protagonists suggest an inner horror, which is unmitigated by their lovemaking, and perhaps even feeds on their relationship. The irrationality of their environment makes the couple our most recognizable guides on this strange road trip, but they demonstrate their own measure of insanity. The male half of the couple betrays an undercurrent of sadism that eventually explodes as an act of sexualized murder. The female's deviance is less clearly defined, but there are several scenes in which she is shown inviting harm. If our trip, as it seems, is through a kind of anti-Eden, and our guides are an every-couple, with no structured identity of their own, then their deviancy would suggest a kind of universal infection, or nature, rather than an aberration of character. This would also render the criminality of the final scenes uncertain, in light of their amoral setting. ---  --- Some would say that the best criterion for judging a horror film is whether it horrifies, regardless of how. This is an unsettling film. It is also an especially tasteless one. In watching this DVD, it may be useful to some viewers that Dumont can be found rationalizing his use of violence (indeed, his violence as an artist) in an interview, in a director's statement, and in the course of the film itself
Now this Military Style Combat Boot is one of a kind! It takes a while to break it in but after, you will enjoy it! It looks so cool just looking at it, never mind wearing it! its leather is tops! And it WILL last a life time! Not water proof, but great for jungle trekking! Shines easy
Reasons to buy it: ---  --- 1. Cheap, a mere $140. --- 2. Packed with features. From complete auto mode (point and shoot) to fully manual mode. 4MP and 3X optical zoom good enough for most situations. --- 3. Picture quality is good. It's better than the other two cameras I own (Olympus C720 UZ and Sony DSC S600). --- 4. Compact. It's smaller than it looks in the stock photo. --- 5. Fast. Switches on and is ready for the first shot within about 1.5 seconds. ---  ---  --- Other things I liked about the camera: ---  ---  - Good ergonomics. Fits nicely in my hand, all the buttons are well placed and easy to access. I can even switch on the camera and take pictures with one hand. ---  - Powerful flash. Enough to fill up a moderate size room. ---  - Great video mode with sound. It also comes with an audio video cable so that you can connect the camera to your TV and watch the vidoes and pictures on your TV. ---  - LCD is decent size and is fairly bright, which means it's even visible outdoors in the daytime. ---  ---  --- Things I didn't like about the camera: ---  ---  - Manual could be more detailed. There is a bsaic manual and sort of a quick start guide. But there was no 40 page booklet which explained each and every feature in detail. ---  - The auto focus illuminator (for help in focussing in low light) is a little bright and can be annoying sometimes. But the upside is that you get good focus even in really low light conditions. ---  - Does not come with a battery charger. I bought rechargeable batteries and a charger separately. ---  ---  --- I have owned the Olympus C720 UZ and the newer Sony DSC S600, but I think this camera is better than both of them.
Bike lock manufacturer Kryptonite recently revealed that tubular cylinder locks -- which this model uses -- can be very easily picked. Kinda defeats the purpose of owning this in the first place.
We Love it! Best purchase I have made in a long time! At first I thought it was a little too much to spend on a metal detector...  This is in the middle range and very easy to use. I bought it as a family project, something we all could do. In the first 3 months of purchasing it we have found 3 diamond rings, 2 gold watches, a bracelet, gold necklace and several old and valuable coins that date back to as early as 1890. Also it's a great hobbie and money maker. Worth every cent!! Don't forget to get the headphones---a MUST!!! Get it for a Christmas 2004 gift, your gift will keep them busy and keep giving back all year long
This jerky is awesome! Great shape, extremely good taste (kind of sweet for jerky, but very tasty) and very healthy (no nitrites, no MSG, no hormones, etc.). Try it
I received a box as a shower gift, and they worked okay, unless I changed them a lot though, they ended up leaking. I was resigned to just living with wet spots, until someone gave me some of the Lansinoh pads to try. I have no idea why Babies R Us doesn't arry them, but they really need to. These things absolutely do not leak, they hold tons of liquid
The product pretty much snapped in half while I was trying to remove two links from one watch.  The other one I tried before this one didn't fit in the adjustment piece at all.  So with that said, do not buy this product at all.  It's very poorly made and terribly annoying to use.  Instructions are very unclear.  I ended up throwing it away and going to a watch shop to get it fixed
I bought this item after being bit in the face by a spider while I was sleeping.  It was not a pleasant experience!  We stirred them up after poking around in the attic during an afternoon.  I was finding the nasty buggers everywhere until I got this unit.   ---  --- Since plugging the Bugfighter in, I've not seen a spider, or any insects, on any of the 3 levels of my home.  I have one in the basement and one in the upstairs hallway.  They've been running about 2 months now.  We've even re-checked the attic, and not a spider to be found.  I'm in Northern VA and we're coming into Spring now.  It will be interesting to see what happens.  Usually I get crickets and a bout with ants and termites as the season kicks off.  If I don't post an update, you know all went well and there were no insect battles this year.  If I have ants and/or termites...you'll be the 1st to know! ---  --- Specific point...no noticeable change in electric bill for 2 months of use. 
  I have the original for the DS lite.  I thought that was fun, but this is better.  The first few chapters seem the same, but the gameplay is better. ---  --- Twisting the bones is a new feature.  Repairing a compound fracture also new to me! ---  --- This game is good because it could really help shape you kids minds and let them explore a simulation to see is practicing medicine would be a job they would like. ---  --- BACK to the game.  I like that the NUNCHUK is the tool that lets you select your surgical instruments.  Having the patient displayed on a big screen is helpful too!  I do wish there was more talking though.  I thought they would upgrade that from DS, but hey didn't.  It's not a waste of money.  It's like tetris in that you either love or hate it!  If you like it, you won't be able to stop playing!
I gave this camera 5 stars because of it's awesome features. This camera is the perfect size for kids and you can put a video on this camera. I love this camera. I think it takes awesome pictures
It's a good value for money -- too rough on the edges
Durability seems to be an issue.  The cord breaks or unravels much too quickly.  The sleeve inside the ball becomes grooved and slows the ball's travel on the cord.  A sleeve made of a harder, slicker material would improve both ball speed and reduce cord wear.  Possible materials are hardened aluminum, stainless steel (polished), teflon-based plastic or polycarbonate
The old DVD from 1997 looks better than the new HD version. I've compared the two, and the first DVD had good color saturation, dark blacks and looked right with the heavy red and brown palette. The HD version has a blue-green haze covering everything and the picture is too bright. They also removed the film grain and made the image look smooth and creamy. The sound quality is better now, though, and the image of course is higher resolution.
We ordered this pea coat from Andrew Christian.  The coat- which is double-breasted- had no inside buttons. You have to have inside buttons to hold the coat evenly. I sent it back as defective.  They were very immovable as to refunding shipping costs to me and then back to them- which amounted to $26.23.  They insisted that it was not defective.  I called five other places that had pea coats and they all had inside buttons. Not reliable and not good to work with.
Egad! Upon receiving this remote control, I found that it requires four AAA batteries. There was no mention of that requirement in the product description! I concur with the other review writer: the control is top heavy, and I would add poorly designed. It's thick at the top and thin at the bottom, making it unwieldy. I will be returning this monstrosity
its beautiful But the heart look large  in the picture but in realty it's small but i think it's better
Great sound form small box. --- Nice platform for tweaking. --- Good power needed
I am a huge U2 fan and this is the BEST concert I have ever seen.  This concert is simply unbeliveable.  It proves to all those stupid people that the belief that U2 were only good in the 80s and 90s is a load of garbage.  U2's still got it.  This concert proves it.  If you don't think U2's good anymore, go watch this concert.  All that You Can't Leave Behind is a good album.  Maybe not as good as Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby but it is still good.  How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb left a little to be desired.  And for the stupid guy at the beginning of these reviews (I think it was the first one) what do you mean Bono was supporting homosexuality???????????  When he kissed Edge, it was representing the betrayal of Jesus Christ.  Look up the lyrics to the song that they were singing,  "Until the End of the World."  "I took the money... I kissed your lips (face in the concert) and broke your heart."  Bono represents Judas Iscariot in the song.  Also, if you still don't believe me and think this is some love song or something, watch any U2 concert with this song- almost all of them show Bono doing a little devil-horn thing, usually after kissing Edge (Christ) The only thing I agree with in that guy's review is that Edge really is the spirit of the band, not Bono.  I love the delay that Edge uses in his guitar.  And I hate how when people think of U2 they think of Bono.  Bono's fine but I love how Edge plays.  Anyway, go read his review if you want to find out more.  Just don't listen to that homosexuality crap.  Anyway, this concert is awesome and I could just watch it over and over again.  In fact, I'm actually watching it tonight!  Great show- makes you feel like you're actually there.  U2 is a wonderful band with good Christian messages in their songs and I can't wait for their next album and concert to come out

Did you ever know someone whose life was just "perfect" ?? Someone who went to college, got married at age 23, found a great job with valuable stock options... Someone who settled down in a house in a nice city at age 25 or 26, started a family a year or two later, and who now seems to "Have it All" ?? Well, after World War II, this happened to JUST ABOUT EVERYONE in the Silent Generation, and it happen to MOST in the boomer generation, and it's happening to JUST ABOUT NO ONE in Generation X. This books speaks to members of Generation X and describes the suffering and coping mechanisms for these people. ---  --- This book, now 15 years, is about a generation that was sold down the river by its elders - Generation X. The book describes 3 young people, Andy, Dag, and Claire, who visit palm springs and tell stories of their lives and of their friends who are suffering in life. The author Douglas Coupland is actually telling stories from Vancouver British Columbia, one of the first cities in North America to be sold out to foreign economic colonizers from Hong Kong (who escaped to Vancouver to avoid the 1997 mainland takeover.) In this city, the worst 1100 square foot fixer-upper house costs a third of a million dollars, or 10 years of take-home pay for a mid-career household.  Economic success is impossible in the physical confines of the city - the system is rigged against everyone except rich immigrants and the existing upper class of blue-collar boomers who purchased homes in the  1970's and 1980's. Many aspects of the book (such as "Reverse Sabbatical", "McJobs", etc.) reflect the severe economic conditions faced by high-achieving intellectuals who go nowhere economically in that city. ---  --- In my grandparents generation, all you had to do was to go to college. In my parent's generation, you needed to go to college and become a successful professional. In my own generation, you need to co-found a startup company and be among the 10% of founders who can sell off the company or have an IPO. Do you notice something here? Yes, it's getting more and more difficult to be marginally successful in America. ---  --- Because Gen X'ers find that traditional paths to success - hard work, taking chances, saving and investing - don't work any more, they resolve to live like their parents by either living WITH THEIR PARENTS or by borrowing money endlessly and hoping for a miracle. Fiscal irresponsibility is at an all-time high, and has squandered everyone's future!  ---  --- In this environment of perpetual economic slavery, Coupland counsels Generation X'ers to break free of the traditional career models that have been rigged by their elders for failure. Coupland counsels us all to re-examine what is success in our life and how to achieve it.   This book is a call to enlist in a class warfare between gen-X'ers and their elders!  In many ways, this book is similar to "The Razor's Edge" by W. Somerset Maughen or "The Monk and the Riddle: The Art of Creating a Life While Making a Living", in other words, redefine your notion of success in the world, while waiting for our evil society to implode in upon itself, which must surely happen in the near future ..
 I had owned an LG burner and from the time I got it, it never worked right. I must have made 60 or 70 coasters before I decided that it was'nt the media, it was the crappy LG brand burner. I was really afraid because there are so many burners on the market and all of them claim to be good, but as I found out with my LG experience, that is not always true.  ---  My brother has an older model Sony burner and although his is slow, it has made a handful of coasters in the 5 years that he has owned it, so I took a chance and purchased the Sony DRU-810A. That was the best decision I could have made. I will never buy another brand burner other that Sony brand. I have had this burner about 7 or 8 months. I am a very heavy burner and I have not made one coaster.  ---  One thing I loved about my brother's Sony burner is that I could use any brand of media. The same thing is true of the DRU-810A. I don't have to worry about where the media was manufactured or who the maker is. This burner loves everything. I had looked at the Plextor brand, but I did'nt want to pay $100.00 and I looked at NEC brand, LiteOn, BenQ. etc., but I am so happy that I passed on them all and got the Sony. It burns super fast. Some people say that it is loud, but it's not loud to me. ---  I got my burner from Tiger Direct for $50.00. My sister's computer came with a crappy LG brand burner too and for almost 2 years she has not been able to burn at all because she gets nothing but coasters too, so for Christmas I am buying her a Sony DUR-810A so she can finally burn some movies. For my money, this is the best burner bar none. --- 
I bought this CD for my two grandchildren for Christmas. They have all the other Nancy Drew CD's that are out and really enjoy playing them. They are a good interactive game to challenge their minds. I am sure this one will too
This is a nice sword for $35 (plus tax). When I removed the sheath, there was some sort of goo on the blade (probaby so it wouldn't rust). This is a carbon blade, so don't leave it in a moist closet for 1 or 5,376 years(by then the rusted blade alone will be worth a fortune). Just dont get the blade wet, ok. You can rub a moist towel across it to get rid of the rust protector if you're going to use it often but that is pretty much all you can do to clean it without a special kit. Please dont brandish this sword around like a bad actor in a kung-fu movie. You could realy hurt someone with the point of the blade. I think this is shipped over seas, so dont challenge your friend to a violent battle the day after you buy this and you should be fine. Blue Dragon is actualy a japanese video game that no one bought. I think it was based on a part of final fantasy 2. I don't want to bore you with video games, so i'll get to the point. Put it on display, dont cut your lawn with it, dont play ninja with it, and dont ever ever ever ever ever ever try to cut a solid object in half with it (prefrebly a tin can) because the cheap blade could fly off the tang and hurt you (or prefrebly your neibor) in the face. Please don't throw the blade at your neibor either. P.S. I am not neil meislin, I am his son, daniel meislin. If you can't understand my numerous perenthesis, I guess you're not smarter than a 5th grader.
My son kept seeing the commercials for this doll and he wanted it so badly.  Talked about it for a month so we got it for him.  He was super excited when he got and and the thing didn't work.  It just randomly gives clues that confused my son the point of tears. He was so confused it would tell him that he was close to it, then say he was no where near it.  Then when he was standing next to it, it said he was no where near it. He was so disappointed.  He thought the toy would be able to play hide n seek with him.  We followed the directs and helped him play with it.  He's 4. ( He wasn't running around like crazy like another person mentioned was why it doesn't work for some kids.) I think this is a terrible toy and Hayley's now in the trash.  She's too cheap and junky looking to even save for my daughter as a regular doll to play with
This one is excellent for the price. Good build and accurate.  --- I wish it had alert function
Overproduction and heavy use of repetitive "special" effects (such as Rothbart's enlarged and projected image "flying" over the heads of Siegfried and Odette) make this version of Swan Lake funny.  Anorexia "survivor" Evelyn Hart's role as Odette/Odile makes watching the video painful.  She is horribly gaunt and looks too fragile to be dancing:  I was plagued with worries that she would collapse at any second.  ---  --- Not worth the money, in my opinion
It is hardly one month old and the pockets on the sides have already started coming off.  It is not the stuff that I expected froma brand name like Panasonic
 I bought one pair of shoes and returned them, they were to large. Bought another pair and hoped that I would adjust to the shoe, I haven"t. I have worn the shoes now and can not return them. I plan to give them away to someone they may fit. I will never order shoes again, I learned my lesson.I agree with the other review good quality in the manufacturing poor design as far as the size.I believe rockport made a mistake with the size and fit and thats why they are being sold for a discounted price. I will go to a shoe depatment and try on the shoes before I buy, as I have in the past
I got these today and was so shocked when they arrived, wow, these are amazing hoops for 25 dollars. I am more than pleased, don't have an idea what some of the other reviewers were complaining about, I am floored at the price and the quality at the same time. With free shipping these are a must, great gift idea and everyday earrings. Amazon got them to me in a matter of 4 days and I'm in Hawaii, they also came beautifully packaged, I'm in love with them, don't let these sell out
This magazine seems to exist solely to promote their advertisers and their products. Their articles focus heavily on their sponsors and the ads far outweigh what little content there is. When they do focus on the best work of the design community, their examples are puzzling. They choose work that is often genuinely awful, and you rarely see any of the work that wins awards in other publications and award shows (ComArts, ADC, Graphis, AIGA, One Club).  While that would be admirable had they found other good work, most of the work they highlight is mediocre at best. There is a reason this magazine is free
I have always loved happy, but I love my happy heart!  I wear it 99% of the time.  My guy loves the smell too...and I often get comments that it smells wonderful.  Not too strong, just enough.  :)  I'd recommend this perfume to everyone, young and old. 
This item cost alot of money but is a piece of crap. Don't expect to put alot of money in this because it won't hold it. My clip broke after a week. Don't buy this item you can find better ones for a lot less money.
This full complement of these classic right hand exercises is found in Scott Tennant's "Pumping Nylon", which also provides an appropriate context in which to use Giuliani's studies..
I replaced my baby's old bumper with this one when she became mobile.  It works fairly well in keeping her from getting her arms or legs caught in between the crib slats.  The only complaint I have is that the "short" section of the bumper can be pushed down quite easily by the baby, thus defeating the purpose of keeping arms/legs inside the crib
A Fresh Taste of Italy is a marvelous resource for an array of recipes; terminology; history; and sources of ingredients. The author paints a glamourous picture of the great diversity that exists in Italian cuisine.  If you purchase only one Italian cookbook...this is the one to get
Too salty for me, there is a better brand out there
This soap works well for sensitive skin.  Smells like Olive Oil but hey that's why they named it olive oil soap. 
I don't understand what the people in charge of producing "The Wiz" as a film, could get by joining the former "BIG" names of Diana Ross, Michael Jackson, Richard Pryor and Lena Horne in this trashy picture. --- The music soundtrack is by far, much better than the movie itself.  --- I have lately become a great Soul music fan, so I recommend to get the soundtrack album and enjoy it considering it just as a very imaginative Soul music work, not keeping in mind that it's a "movie soundtrack". In such manner you will enjoy it more! ---  ---   ---   
John Michael Mongomery is back with a big bang.  This album is one of the best to come out this year. It's better than that of Travis Tritt, Alan Jackson, and Kenny Chesney.  The song I wanna be there is one of the most touching songs since Alan's Where Were you.  He mixes the soulful ballads, with his country rockers, and sweet love songs.  THis is vinatage JMM and should be bought by any true country music fan
I wear Stay Neutral and have been using this product for years.  Doesn't clog pors and it looks flawless.  This is a really great product and work the $18.00
I bought this camera for my 16 year old granddaughter and she just loves it. The pics are bright and clear and the camera is very easy to handle
  I bought this dock from a seller called Miga.  They did an excellent job of answering my questions on the product and sending everything in mint condition.  I use the dock for my HP R817.  Having read the reviews regarding the insert I just went through HP's part site and ordered the correct insert for my camera.  It was only $5 (before shipping) and it arrived the same day as the dock package.  The dock transfers data so much faster then the cradle that comes with the camera plus it has an extra battery which would cost $50 and up by itself from HP.  I bought the dock for its dual charging ability for when I go on trips since this dock is less expensive then the fast charge travel kit.  I probably won't use the remote control feature or print images right from the dock.  But for what I will use it for its an excellent product for the price and I highly recommend it for you 817 818 users out there. 
Why do some people call Bratz dolls 'sluts/slutz'? Are you guys mad? They are just dolls. They are made of plastics. So what they wear SHORT mini skirt? They just DOLLS. If you hated mini skirt soooo much, well don't wear them. --- I saw many teenage celebs wear mini skirts. --- THEY ARE JUST DOLLS, okay? No need to argue if they wear short mini skirts.  --- Anyway, about this doll I am totally adore her. She is very pretty and very ROCKSTAR material (I don't know how 2 spell.I don't care about her having tatoos. Lot of celeb got tatoos and she's a rockstar material.
I love this bra! I have 2, so that one is always in the wash.  It is the most comfrotable thing I have ever put on.  I bought it a week after my son was born and my milk came in. It was so much more comfortable then my other nursing bra.  I felt so much better after I put it on for the first time.  I felt like I could breathe again
I figured for the price, how could you go wrong? Well my fiancee used this hairdryer at most 5 times a week and in less than 3 months it has now quit working altogether. No HOT air, No Cold air...NOTHING!! This Item looks like a great deal..but Save your $$$ and buy something that will last you longer than 2-1/2 months. The manufacturer should be ashamed to sell such a product!
I've only had this scale for a short time, but so far so good.  I've found that in order to get a scale that is perfect or near perfect you have to spend a boat load of money. As someone before has mentioned the one drawback to this scale is that you have to set it back to zero every so often.  I specifically wanted to get an analog scale for this reason, with an inexpensive digital scale, which is what I had last, you can't reset it like you can an analog.  This scale is a great buy, for only $10 how can you go wrong!
this guitar i receieved has a warped neck; how dare you send this product out
I would call this the musical equivalent of the worst of abstract art.  There are those that "appreciate" unintelligable works for fear of being thought stupid if they don't . . . just as the emporer's subjects "Ooh"ed and "Ah"ed in admiration of his clothing as he paraded naked in front of them
Heres the thing about batteries. They eat people. Yeah. You can never trust a battery, cause those things are HEARTLESS. Especially Rayovac... those give me the creeps. *Shudder* So the next time you think about buying batteries, think about B.E.P.-Batteries eat people. Dont even think about it, punk
well it was shown as a Full tang double bladed katana but after buying the item and checking it out for myself i have found its nothing more than a rat tailed show piece...as far as show pieces go it does look nice however its not the Full Tang construction i was expecting to see and feel when i bought it. ---  --- Fast shipping though
This is an O.K movie. I give it a 3.5. It starts out with the origin of Mewtwo, as using DNA from the legendary Pokemon Mew's eyebrow fossil to create a clone, Mewtwo. Soon, Team Rocket leader Giovanni tries to control Mewtwo after he destroys the lab from which he was born in, but Mewtwo has other plans, thinking his purpose is not to serve humans. So he invites the most powerful Pokemon trainers to the New Island to see who can stand up to him. But things get outta control when Mewtwo steals all the Pokemon in black Pokeballs and creates artificial "Super-Clones" to prove that clones are the strongest in the universe. But he didn't count on Ash, a young Pokemon Trainer. Ash destroys the cloning machine, thus bringing Mew to the scene and saving the captured Pokemon. Who'll win? The superclones or the originals? Mew or Mewtwo? You've got to see it to beleive it
This is a tough read.  He gets so bogged down in the details that I forgot what I was reading about
Without my husband being handy, this would have been in the trash on Dec 26th.  Took almost 2 hours to assembly with these small wooden pegs that barely held the unit together.  It fell apart when my daughter was playing with it on Christmas Day and so my husband improvised with stronger screws to hold it together.   Though she loves playing with it - we need to find out where we can purchase the furniture that the picture shows??
This mascara is great, it's easy to remove with a little warm water, but the best thing about it is that it won't give you 'racoon eyes'. There's no dis-coloration of the skin around the eyes. It also keeps looking great all through the day, no need to re-apply it. --- The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is, that even though they come in different colors, they all look more black than colored when dry. So the color doesn't stand out enough. --- Still, I can highly recommend it
The book is really thorough when it comes to showing how to do proper lifting techniques with the kettlebell in different variations.It's great for a beginner who is starting out.
The umbrella I ordered is fine, just what I had hoped it would be. However, I subsequently ordered an umbrella stand (after you prompted me to do so) and when it arrived the two tightening screws  in the shaft had been damaged in shipment. Each of the screws have plastic knobs and the knobs were broken off. As a result when one tightens them the broken plastic is sharp enough to cut skin. I have tried unsuccessfully to find replacements at a hardware store.  Any suggestions
Now I finally have the look and feel of a celebrity.  The best product on earth period!  I've tried all ingrown hair product's since 1985 beleive me Ive' spent thousand of dollars, nothing comes close to it "forget about it" Saliylic Acid is history in my book. Sorry Dermatologist their is a cure.  I bought 1 bottle before christmas 2006.  Since the new year 2007 started I've already bought 2 bottle's and I'm spreading the word.  Don't delay a smooth and perfect face is just a few days away. --- Thanks to all who have complimented my slick and smooth face. --- J. Diaz    Aka  (Papi rico
Granted, this is not one of the better tasting cereals, but when you consider that it will provide the daily recommendation of fiber in just 2/3 cup, the trade-off is worthwhile.  If there is an easier way to get 26 grams of fiber, I haven't found it.  Just be aware that, if you prefer sugary sweet cereals, this definitely is not the one for you
Be warned that the business card side is deep enough to hold 50 cards.  I bought this wallet only to hold a few credit cards, my ID and some cash.  Hence, there is a lot of wasted space in my wallet.  From the picture, it looks as though the business card side is just a slot. Whereas, in reality, it is actually a pouch (like most of the other card holders).  Other drawbacks are that there is some filler underneath the leather to make it look smoother (which takes up quite a bit of space), the leather itself is very low quality, and the wallet does not close well even without anything in it.  Furthermore, on the inside of the wallet there is a large white tag stating that it was Made in China.  I mean, China is great and all but if you're on a date and you say "Hey, let me pay for this," and you pull out your credit card and a large white tag protrudes with it saying Made in China, well, you are pretty much a schmuck (I cut mine out with a pair of scissors, but there are still some remnants).  So if you like being low class, by all means, buy this wallet.  I personally don't care about my wallet very much so I am keeping it and going to use it, but I almost returned it.  It is most definitely a solid 2 stars.  Hope this helps
Lots of very gourmet foods, could tell the personal touch was there.  Arrived packaged safely and with care and at the time it was stated to arrive.  You could not do better when purchasing gift baskets than using this company.  I have ordered them for years and this is the best of the bunch
I ORDERED TWO OF THESE SETS AND WAS NOT SENT WHAT IS DESCRIBED. --- THERE IS NO LARGE ALUMINUM BASKET AND NO FISH FRY BASKET INCLUDED.  THE DESCRIPTION SAYS IT IS PROFESSIONAL GRADE, BUT I RECEIVED COMMERCIAL GRADE.  CUSTOMER SERVICE HAS OFFERED TO SEND ME OUT A REPLACEMENT, BUT I AM ASSUMING THE SAME THING WILL HAPPEN AGAIN.  IT SEEMS AS IF AMAZON ATTACHED THE WRONG PICTURE AND DESCRIPTION TO THIS ITEM. BEWARE IF YOU WANT EVERYTHING THAT IS LISTED, THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU WILL GET
This book is outdated for the 21st century. The basics are there and in great detail but most of the information is useless for today
I have subscribed to Asimov's for 15 years.  It is the very best Sci Fi Magazine out there.  All the best authors that you have heard of and many that are undiscovered treasures.  If you are a fan of short Science Fiction then you will not be disappointed
Seth Brundle (Goldblum) is a scientist who might just have invented the world's first teleporter. The only bug (pun intended) is the fact that it doesn't handle flesh and live teleportations. Ronnie (Geena Davis) is a writer for Particle magazine and will stay by his side, documenting via video his attempts to break through. Upon successfully teleporting a baboon, Seth gets cocky and decides to try and teleport himself; a fly slips into the pod while he teleports. At first, Seth finds newfound strength and agility, but pretty soon he's changing for the worst.  ---  --- This is one of Cronenberg's best films, masterfully directed and executed. It's also Jeff Goldblum's finest performance to date! Not content on doing a mere remake (the original Fly (1958) is a much different film starring Vincent Price), Cronenberg brings this film to the next level--literally. It's filled with deep human drama and let's not forget the award-winning special effects! Top notch effects contribute in putting this film ahead of the pack of other mid-eighties sci-fi/horror flicks. The film overall has aged well (it's already been twenty years) if not for the eighties fashion statements. ---  --- I'm having a hard time figuring out which it is more; a sci-fi or a horror film? I guess it's a fusion of both (I gotta stop these bad puns!). Whether you see it for the first time or revisit it, Cronenberg's The Fly is a great gory, character-driven, profoundly human film. The second disc is chock full of special features: various documentaries and a making-of, screenplays, the original short story on which the original film is based, trailers for all the Fly movies ever made, deleted scenes, and much much more. A must have for any Cronenberg fan
Great backup solution. I install a second hard drive into someones computer and then let the software run and then forget about it. Never fails. Have not done a restore yet, but I would imagine it would be easy since I have an image of the hard drive and then the data that is up to date. Also, bought the software from a vendor that Amazon recommends, I don't no why they do this, but the software listed on Amazon is $49.99 which is the right price. I bought two from a vendor for $15.00 each. WOW what a savings and a great markup for me
The product was delivered in a timely manner and functions properly
The movie is a about a guy, who does a lot of work and no fun and then feels sorry about that. That's pretty much the whole story. Well, the idea is quite powerful but not new, the characters are done in the "comics" style and very primitive, the jokes are quite boring.  ---  --- Actually what is really amazing, that it could've been ok to watch as a family movie, but a few really tasteless jokes made it PG13 rated without adding any fun, so the movie about family values is not appropriate for kids. ---  --- Too boring for adults, not appropriate for kids, too much moral for young crowd - I can't really think who might like it
The shoe is too narrow and the sides dig into my feet.  The sole of the shoe makes it feel like you are off balance.  I have narrow feet but the structure of this shoe does not lend itself to a comfortable wear at all. 
I made the mistake of subscribing to Make, based on the hype.  It turns out to be long and tedious, with instructions on how to make really messy junk of virtually no interest or use.  Successive issues have gone down hill, and by issue 4 they were dealing in vanity pictures of people's garage workshops.  Maybe you'll be the one in a million who wants to make useless junk, but buy a copy or two at the newstand before you subscribe.  It's not obviously wonderful
Very topical. Easy read. Hope people in the know read this and give serious thought to the potential for something like this happening.  Gives good reason why border control should be taken more serious by everybody. Looking forward to reading other books by Mr. Bell
I bought this shaver last September, and at that point I agreed with the other reviewers. It delivered a nick-free shave and was quick and painless to use. This past May, it stopped being able to re-charge and just died completely. I only used the recommended cleaning solution, changed it according to the instructions, and cleaned it after every use. I sent the shaver back to Remington, they were very nice and sent a new replacement shaver after a few weeks. It worked wonderfully, for about 2 months when the same problem occurred again! I'm sending it back again and hoping for a refund this time, it isn't worth my time and money to go to the post office every few months to return yet another defective shaver!
Truly this is the magazine of the warmongers, the neocons, who would gladly repopulate America completely with non-Europeans, except for the neocons themselves and their cohorts, who are of  "a race of the mind," as one wag put it, by and large. ---  --- Pro-war and anti-American people (and certainly anti- Euro-American people), this magazine is truly one to be boycotted.  If you are an American of European descent THE AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE will more likely be for you.  If you are racially aware and don't wish to see your people vanish from the Earth, I would also recommend THE OCCIDENTAL QUARTERLY. ---  --- To give the devil his due, TWS does carry some interesting book reviews at times. ---  --- If you love your people, as long as they are not from "the race of the mind," do not buy this magazine, and if you already subscribe do the smart thing and cancel for a refund, as I did a few days ago. ---  --- Highly recommended as antidotes to this warmongering propaganda are two outstanding collections, NEO-CONNED! and NEO-CONNED AGAIN
I'm so technically challenged, and I had no trouble figuring out this system.  I already had the base unit and had to search for these handsets to go with it. Altogether they were a bit pricey, but worth every penny!  Very easy to understand the directions, and lots of bells and whistles.  Lots of cool ring tones and features that are not listed on the product description.  I love the intercom features, they are great for when the kids are upstairs, I don't have to yell for them to come down or go upstairs to talk to them.  Very cool
I mean come ON, who needs 5 blades right? ---  --- Well, after thoughtful consideration of the major improvement that the Mach III was over a twin head razor, I decided that $10 was worth the price of a cheap thrill so I took the plunge, and to my surprise this thing works beyond my expectations.  ---  --- The first thing I noticed was that this new Fusion has a more powerful engine than the Mach III. The second thing I found was that this razor gives me a much closer shave than the Mach III, and with very little effort, and those tight spots that my old razor would always miss are not a problem anymore. And I find this razor to be very comfortable without a single nick that others have complained about. But I do use this razor strictly for my face if you know what I mean. haw haw 5 Blade
Anything coming out of a box at Christmastime is exciting to our toddler.  Most toys, though, hold an excitement for him.  This trike lost his interest after one try.  Scuttle the trike I say, or let it become unmoved furniture in your home
I find that the new version 7 of Adobe Acrobat loads faster than version 5, both stand-alone and within my internet browser.  Also, the new version is better integrated with the browser and with Microsoft Office.  I believe Adobe heard and responded to the complaints about version 6.  There are many other features which I have yet to try but certainly look worthwhile.  Kudos for what I see as a substantial improvement.  I recommend
This is the greatest cleaning system I've seen, it's sturdy and I can reach to the top of my cathedral ceilings easily.  The ceiling fan attachement is great a couple of swipes with this attachement and it's clean, no more standing on a step ladder trying to reach the fan blades
My 7 1/2 year old daughter tried these on at a friend's house yesterday.  SHe had them on for about 2 minutes before she fell and got hurt.  After a trip to the ER and the Orthopedic Surgeon, she has a fracture in her growth plate.  Need I say more
i got to get it off my chest.  this camera takes great photos and they print out wonderful.  BUT, the camera has several down sides:   1. as all have said, it eats batteries big time.  this is a pain.  2. it recharges slow between flash and between non flash.  forget about catching a great spontaneous moment.   3. not durable.  i dropped mine out of the case from below waist hight and it does nto work at ALL.  i am sure by the time i send it in and pay for shipping and repair i can buy a new one that is cheaper and more reliable.  any suggestions???
This is their best album.Easily better than anything the likes of Oasis ever managed.Richard III,Going Out,Late In The Day and the title track are all top quality.If you rated Blurs 3 "Britpop"(horrible term really) albums from the 90s then get this.Its up there with them.Simple as that
I just bought a new Genesis after owning my last one for 11 years. Excellent product. There's plenty of product info on this page from Amazon and the manufacturer, so let me tell you a few things that I do to make my Weber work best for me. ---  --- -Most importantly...keep it covered. Amazon sells a cover...get it. Not coving it will cut its life in half at least. --- -Cover the funnel shaped grease drip pan with tin foil and change it regularly; otherwise build-up in the trap can catch fire and THAT does not make a steak taste very good. --- -Change the disposable grease traps regularly (otherwise they start to stink). --- -Get yourself a quality wire brush and use it before each use...NOT after. The build-up on the cooking grates after each use actually protects them from the elements. --- -Before each use, after you wire brush the grates, put some cooking oil on some paper towels and wipe the grates down. --- -Pre-heat the grill on high for at least 5 - 10 minutes; it burns off anything left over from the cleaning and makes the cooking grates nice and hot. --- -Initiate cooking steaks, chops, any cuts of meat (even burgers...no, not hot dogs) on just-over-medium heat for 2 minutes on each side and flip before cooking to your liking. This brief searing of each side locks in the flavor of your cut of meat.  --- -Cook with a closed cover; normal cuts of meat shouldn't take more than a total of 10 minutes (including the searing). --- -Let your meat sit for up to 5 minutes before slicing (or biting into it!). This locks in the juices; if the juices are too hot when you slice (or bite), they'll run right out of your cut of meat. ---  --- There you go. Hope that helps. And don't forget to cover the grill after it cools. Bon appetit!
I have been purchasing these mushrooms for years by driving to specialty stores in either NYC or Philadelphia.  Even including shipping, this is the best price I have ever seen on these mushrooms! I even received an e-mail telling me shipping may be delayed due to Hurricane Wilma, But still got the product in less than a week! I paid more than double this in a famous Philadelphia cheese shop, and the quality wasn't as good as this! I will definitely be doing more business with this company!
 OK this isnt really a review but more of a reaction to another review, which in my opinion was written by no child.  It's just a doll...get over it. And stop wasting the space where some of us people actually write real reviews. I just had to say something about that. Oh...I did order this doll but I'm still waiting for her to arrive :
First experience with this brand.  Very well made & elegant.  I actually had my first compliment EVER.."What a good-looking Bar-B-Q cover".  If it holds up well during our 100+ summer desert heat, I'll definately choose this brand again...along with the great Amazon service
This book would not be helpful for children of faiths other than Christianity
I bought this sippy cup seeing how informative the review was.. and I was happy when i saw it and my baby liked it..  --- But whn i went to wash it, i cleaned the valve, by removin a obvious piece that had to be removed to clean... and it never was able to attach corrctly it will fall in her drink and completely get my babys face all wet so after ONE use i had to discard it... maybe it was defected but i was not satisfied with it
This game is amazing. Unlike so many other star wars games, this is a first person shooter, which is a great touch to the star wars universe. I found the gameplay to be very well done with the healing stations on the battlefield and your squad always with you to revive you if you fall in battle. The coolest thing of all is that instead of carrying multiple weapons, you have attachments to one gun. The attachments are sniper, and rocket launcher. The single player campaign is outstanding, though the multiplayer is so-so. This game is simply a terrific Star Wars title
My Wife and I bought this item for the usual reasons.  We washed them and had no problems with fuzzballs or shredding.  They're just as soft and sturdy as they were before we washed them, if not a little softer.  For the record, we washed them on the cold cycle with other baby clothes.  They went through the drier for an hour at the lowest heat setting.   ---  --- Anyway, I'm just writing the review to offset the bad review.  There was nothing wrong with the pads that we received, and they do what they're supposed to do-- get between the warm baby and the cold changing table
Laptop Magazine is an excellent resource for the mobile professional.  The staff has done a great job of reviewing products relevant to those individuals attached to their laptops and related gadgets. Despite the name, the magazine is not merely about laptops but also the tools and strategies for the peripatetic white-collar worker. ---  --- With information on laptops, mobile phones, hotels and airlines, Laptop Magazine is loaded with great insights. Its layout is excellent as it appears far less cluttered than other computer magazines - much like how the Harvard Business Review differs from Star Magazine.  Yet, it is a bit light on specific computer tasks and tweaking.  This may be due to the demographic of the audience, which is most likely a collection of mid-level executives and sales professionals instead of hands-on technology gurus.   As such, the magazine is well worth the read as it will certainly save time with your work, travel, and technology purchases in the future. ---  ---  --- Pros: --- Excellent product information --- Great organization and layout ---  ---  --- Cons --- Light on nuts and bolts computer technology --- No concise source of the laptop reviews (i.e. like Motor Trend has a summary of tests with dates and results with every magazine).
Bought this hoping for a good amount of steam for facials and sinus problems.. hardly any steam comes out and there are too many little pieces and parts.  Not worth the $$ at all. I'm back to boiling a large pot of water for steam
The crib arrived much sooner than I was quoted.  I was told 3 weeks, it came in 4 days.  Very prompt. It is a beautiful crib, I love it.  The directions are a bit lax.  It took my husband and I two hours to put it together. Mainly because the instructions only showed how to put together the ends and the drawer, and not the rest of the crib!  We finally figured it out.  Other than that the crib is beautiful
Some existing programs, such as Norton System Works, are not compatible with Vista and Norton insists that you pay for an upgrade to the 2007 version. Other than the compatibility issue, Windows Vista Home Basic works fine for me. ---  ---  --- Larry Leika
Any Sam Kinison fan needs to own this DVD or video.  You get 2 of Sam's HBO specials plus many special stand up features and Sam's home movies.  The only reason I did not give this box set a 5 star rating is the fact that in the first special feature called: rare stand up(I love the special features on DVDs), Sam told many jokes that were already on the HBO special.  Other than that, Sam's comedy is unlike anything you will see today.  He will really be thought of as a comedy legend.  These DVD's will crack you up.  I would recomend buying the Sam Kinison CDs, Live From Hell, and Have you seen me lately?  The Cd's(just listen to them in your car or at home) will give you the complementary material you need(plus the HBO specials) to truely love Sam Kinison.  He is one of the best, and you will be satisfied with with any purchase.  Just buy 1 CD or DVD and you will be hooked
The diamonds are waaayyy too small.  Nothing like the picture.  Sent it back
This CD reminds me once again why Russian liturgical music is one of the treasures of the world: beautiful, profound, awe-inspiring, uplifting. ---  --- For the most part, the pieces are well chosen and the performances excellent. I am delighted to see that many of the tracks are from the classic recording of the Rachmaninoff Vespers made in the early 1970s by the USSR Ministry of Culture Chamber Choir directed by Valery Polyansky, and released in the USA by Angel-Melodiya.  I wore out my copy of the LP years ago; although it has been reissued on CD, it's out of print and very hard to find. So it is wonderful to see a generous selection from that recording available on this disk. ---  --- Listen to track 11, "Praise the Lord O My Soul", sung by the chamber choir and mezzo Irina Arkhipova. You would have to have a heart of stone not to be moved as she sings "Slava Ghospidin" (Praise to the Lord). And listen to how the basses descend to B-flat at end. It just doesn't get any better than this
Although it is very funny, and it is about talking animals that drive cars, "The Wind in the Willows" is not suitable for four to eight year olds to read on their own.  That would be the Disney cartoon version, not the book, which is pretty sophisticated for such a young age group.  It is great to read aloud, however, and for older kids who love nature and humor, "The Wind in the Willows" could lead to a lifetime love of books.  "The Wind in the Willows" reminds me of the Victorian humor book "Three Men in a Boat", because both are about the adventures of a group of wacky English bachelors messing about in boats on the river.  It is funny, with real slapstick comedy, and it is also touching, because it deals with friendship and loyalty, and beautiful, because it is about nature, and love of the countryside and home.      
The Jerdon 7P7506CF (or as I call it, the ol'6CF) is a nice, reflective wall-attachable mirror.  I can't say enough about how reflective this thing is; I'm a bit of an amateur facepainter (although I have zero artistic ability- my Spider-Man faces usually end up looking like spotty tomatoes), so I need a good mirror whenever I self-paint.  I have gone through three similar models before finding the 6CF, and none has been as clear and user-friendly. ---  --- In short, if you're looking for the best mirror value for your dollar, I can't recommend this thing enough.  It's the mirror of the 21st century, and beyond
This coffee doesn't have anything special about it. I like good Kona coffee and I think 2 stars really tells it all
The best weekly news magazine on the market, Time also gives science and technology updates, movie reviews, some celeb news, and provocative articles on world trends. Well worth a subscription, especially if you don't have time for the nightly new
I recently purchased this software and had to uninstall it.  In my case, I was unable to get into my Quicken account, which is password protected.  One of the features of Confidential is an "Information Vault" which stores all passwords.  I was prompted to enter the Quicken one as well, but chose not to as I felt this would defeat the purpose of having a password set up in the first place.  After that, when I would enter the Quicken password, my machine would just hang up.  The only way I could get in was by opening it in safe mode.   ---  --- I believe that this product sounds appealing on the surface, but when you get down to it, it promises more than it can deliver.  I also think that when it comes to internet security, the best solution is to take reasonable precaution.  If you respond to an e-mail requesting your account numbers and passwords, a software package is not going to save you. ---  --- I purchased this product based on my previous experience with Norton products and have been quite satisfied with their performance.  Thus, I was extremely disappointed with this product
This is a good product, except it keeps shutting down when I have my outlook or when I have a web page open.   My main goal for an antivirus would be to run when I search the web or get in new emails!   What good is it if it shuts down when these are open!   It did find a trojan on my first scan.  This was one that Norton missed.  I will be getting NOD32 soon.  Sorry this product did not work for me! It was very easy to use
My tea came after three weeks and it was only one pack instead of six. I called and complained and the following week got another one pack instead of six.  That is all I ever received and my money was refunded.  Don't really know what happened...never got an explanation from the distributor
Who hasn't wanted a pair of these since they were a little girl? So glamorous, girly, and sexy. I was surprised how comfortable they are on the foot. They really do feel like slippers, just with the heel as a bonus. I normally wear a 6W or a 6 ½, so these are a little snug, but not too bad. So glad I bought them- two pairs red & black. Pink will be next..
I found two paperbacks at work, which were both thriller series, both written by women, both having two word titles with the first word being "Blind."  One of the two I found exciting and satisfying, and eagerly read it.  That was not this book. ---  --- At first, I thought it was just me.  Unlike others, I found it easy to get into the book.  But I found it too new age for me.  Between Eve talking to her dead daughter to the creepy Aldo to Jane's connection with the murdered Cira, I decided I didn't need to read the whole novel and checked to make sure Jane and Trevor survived.   ---  --- Maybe this wasn't Iris Johansen's best book.  But I'm not going to be trying any of her others, based on this one
 To start with, the description of this kit is false. There are NOT 75 pieces... only 11. The detail is VERY, VERY poor... large soft-edged raised blocks with only the vaguest resemblance to the Death Star as seen in the films. You'd honestly be better off starting with a smooth plastic ball & making a Death Star from scratch, rather than buying this kit.
This product hurts and ripps out your hair when you use it. It also leaves ur hair smelling burn't and smokey. When you go out and it is humid ur hair will go back to its normal self and get very frizzy. The only good thing is that it does not break easily
Ok, these tasted good although they were much tougher than the sugared brand.  I ate about a serving and a half and so did my husband right after we got them.  That evening we both had bloating and terrible flatulence.  It was the holidays so I didn't immediately attribute it to the vines.  I brought some to work to satisfy my afternoon sugar cravings and ate another serving sitting at my desk.  Later that afternoon I was in an important meeting bloated beyond belief and trying not to embarrass myself.  I have since thrown out all my other bags--these things create at best a very embarrassing and uncomfortable several hours and at worse a terrible health problem.  I think they should be taken off the market or at least labelled with a warning "may cause significant distress to your digestive track and embarrassing flatulence!
finally tried this, and I definitely recommend it.  It doesnt have a strong smell, very pleasant and neutral.  It feels so good on your skin after you shave, very soothing and moisturizing. Try some, you'll love it
Mitts no good tore up in two weeks, inside came out. very displease
I purchased this tripod from 47th Street Photo through Amazon.com.  The tripod appeared to arrive in good shape, except that the operating instructions were not included.  I immediately emailed 47th Stree Photo at the customer service address printed on the flyer they included with my shipment.  I asked them if they would be able to send me a copy of the operating instructions.  They did not respond to my email, so a few days later I emailed them again.  Once again, no response.  I then emailed Amazon.com, and informed them of the missing instructions and the non-responses from 47th Street Photo.  No response from Amazon either!  As far as the tripod goes, it appears to be a very good value for the money.  I gave it 4 rather than 5 stars because, due to the missing operating instructions, I cannot be certain I have properly checked out all of its features.  However, I am certain that both 47th Street Photo and Amazon.com rate zero stars for customer service.  I will use neither one again
We purchased this because my newborn was having trouble sleeping. She always woke up congested and strangled. Since we started using the wedge she hasn't had any problems at all she is 5 months old now
do not believe that last one  i have purchased this exact horn and it is works great so far the sound is wonderful it looks great and it stays in good condition if you take care of it this horn is one of the bes
I love the cotton color, just the right shade for most beige and some white slacks. --- The show style it the most unconfortable of any Clark shoe I have have. There is something strange about the left shoe, it give me a blister everytime I wear it
purchased the phone about 3 months, like the nice QVGA screen, and impressed with excellent cam (it works pretty well in macro mode and outdoors) --- the phone has good reception, at least on par with W810 --- voice call is OK, but as other users stated, the level is kinda low (esp speakerphone), firmware upgrade (R1KC001) will help --- the operation is standard SE style, if you are familiar, you'll be OK without reading manual --- the audio player can play streaming 3gp and realaudio (still used by BBC), and it works well with T-Mobile internet; it can play local mp3 (VBR supported), wma, asf audio (rename the extension to .wma), realaudio; but I wish it supports ogg vorbis, which is the audio format I use --- bluetooth works pretty well, it works with ALL bt equipment I have (including wireless headphones) --- logitech headphones users please read: in order to make the headphones works properly, you need to go to bt menu, and connect from there --- web browser can handle regular html sites as well as simplified html, and wap sites --- the phone is kinda bulky, and a bulge on cam cover, but it's pretty comfortable and firm to hold, making messaging is a good pleasure --- though the phone has lot of functions/features are pretty appealing, it lacks something it's supposed to have: --- quad-band, this is not acceptable for this price, even many lower models have quad-band (K550, W610, W580, W810, Z710, W710) --- music player should have more file format support: ogg vorbis, streamimg wma/asf, shoutcast --- m2 memory card, though the phone has possibility to support up to 32GB, PSP card is a lot cheaper --- pro: --- QVGA screen, and it shows clock when the phone is idle --- wireless headphones support --- 3mpx cam with auto-focus and xenon flash --- comfortable and firm to hold --- con: --- low earpiece and speakerphone level (though firmware upgrade will fix) --- tri-band --- cam cover bulge --- conclusion: if you want a phone with excellent screen and cam, go for it, however, if you travel a lot, settle with quad-band models (they're cheaper
Along with "From Science To God" Mr Russell establishes himself as one of the masters of spiritual reawakening.  Although this piece has more doomsday in it than his later work, it has the same hopeful message and the same readability.   ---  --- In both books Mr Russell never seems to lose the reader in scientific mumbo jumbo, even when discussing very complicated subjects.  That isn't a statement on his intelligence or research, but rather on his ability to communicate on all levels.  Neither does he offend when he deals with the spiritual aspects of his writings. In short everyone can sit around his table (well, almost everyone).  ---  --- Read'em twice.
These plays were okay, I'm glad I rented them before buying them.  The props and things were very nice, the actors didn't gel well with each other or connect with their characters and the singing was mediocre ( definitely no Tyler Perry quality on that note) but the messages were good just seemed a little unrealistic and too drawn out.  I thought Alexander O'Neal sang in one of them but he didn't
I purchsed this product for my husband and he hates beauty products. When we got it the minty scent was soooo strong in the box. When we opened the box it was like a minty apple juice drink. He used it and I was all over him and the minty smell gave him just the right energy to "bring it"
Robert Ryan made a number of Westerns during the 1950s and '60s, but always he seemed to be overshadowed by other actors in the genre. Nevertheless, who can forget THE WILD BUNCH or his magnificent portrayal of "old man Clanton" in the seriously underrated HOUR OF THE GUN (with James Garner). And his self-effacing determination is equally unforgettable in THE DAY OF THE OUTLAW. Now one of his best roles, as the straight-arrow sheriff in THE PROUD ONES is on DVD and available at a very reasonable price. Finally.  THE PROUD ONES is perhaps director Robert Webb's finest picture, combining great action scenes and plot twists, taught dialogue, and a superior cast that includes not only Ryan, but Jeffrey Hunter, Walter Brennan, Virginia Mayo, and Robert Middleton. Minor roles are given attention as well, especially Arthur O'Connell (as Ryan's deputy) and, important thematically, the wonderful Paul Burns, who plays the town drunk and panhandler....Hunter, when he finally assumes the mantle of sheriff, will give alms to Burns at the finish of the movie, just as Ryan did at the beginning, when he was sheriff. This touch dramatically completes the movie and has much to say about Hunter's increased maturity.  THE PROUD ONES is a superb movie, with a great story...it will repay re-viewing. Unlike some Westerns, I don't tire of watching it periodically. It is that good...
I thought these muffins tasted like white rice bread which isn't very tasty.  I've made my own muffins mixing brown rice flour, tapioca flour, and potato starch flour and they are a million times better.  Won't buy these again.  I expected these to be as close to the real thing as the Glutino crackers are to regular crackers(not the tomato basil but the plain ones) but they weren't
It was a great product when it worked.  Sleek design, super user friendly, sharp image and easily unlock to all region.  Never had any problem loading or playing until last week.  Went completely dead for no reason in the middle of a movie.  Swallowed the DVD with it.  It would've been a greater product if it lived pass 1 year at least
I have purchased 2 of these clocks now. The moment I inserted the batteries in the clock started advancing and stopped at 4 'O' Clock. I was getting ready to ship it back thinking that it was a bad clock. But within 5 minutes both the clocks received the transmission and corrected themselves to exact time. So moral of the story is don't return the clocks without giving it some time as it looks like these clocks stop at 4 and doesn't move at all till it receives the time
I bought this seat to travel with my toddler and found it extremely annoying and difficult to use.  The tray stuck and never loosened up and was difficult to get my child in and out of.  Also, it was close to impossible to keep clean, unless you unstrapped it and took it completely apart after every use.  It was very unwieldy to travel with.  It folded up, but didn't stay together and so was not very portable.  Because it was so cumbersome, it ended up getting dropped on a laminate floor and promptly broke.  The cheap plastic its made of shattered at the bottom corner where the side and seat fit, so now it is in the garbage where it belongs.  I only owned it for five months and used it barely three times a month for the average.  Yes, it was cheap, but as they say, the poor man buys everything twice, and now I'm out fifteen dollars and have to buy another booster. 
For the price this is not a bad keyboard.  Here are the two major problems I have with it: ---  --- 1) The feel is nothing like a real piano.  The keys are springy and you have to apply a fair amount of pressure to hold a note. ---  --- 2) The instructions have a big sticker on them, stating that this keyboard is made of materials known to cause cancer and/or birth defects (including lead) and to "wash your hands after handling".  How on earth did this manufacturer decide to use such materials with a device that is intended to be handled a lot, very possibly by children? ---  --- It's going back... --- 
You don't want this one.  Although the fabric is appealing (calm stripes vs. the buzy themes of the other covers) this cover will not fit most shopping carts.  It only fits the carts found at small city super markets.  If you are a suburbian shopper you'll have to spend the bucks for  a more satisfactory product
This book sucked because its like an autobiography of some idiot who knew nothing about what he was doing...his book is mostly life-stories...and stupid ones at that...some teeter the line of racism, he emphasizes attempting to hex some evil "fat black woman" and he demonizes some other young brothers later on in the book, i see most of the reviewers overlooked the fact that this guy was kind of out of line with his emphasis on "race".  --- And besides that, his 2 or 3 spells and such are old and tired...and there is no "self-initiation" for the type of Voodoo he's talking about... ---  --- i am sorry but this book was a waste of time and money, i came away from this little book knowing not one single solitary grain of anything worth knowing. If you looking to learn about Voodoo or Vodun this book will not help.  ---  --- His title is also misleading because "Voodoo" ussually refers to Hoodoo and "Vodun" ussually refers to the religion but this author isnt talking about either one....he's just running his mouth on and on and on as if his life-experiences are even worth tellin. ---  --- This book is a great example to why people of a foriegn back-ground to African based religions should not write books about it as if they could really know but so much.....this was a terrible book that this sorry author made about a system he obviously knows nothing about
This is probably the worst CD I have ever bought. It had won some award and just bought it without listening to it, hopping that it would be OK. I listened to it and threw the CD in the trashbin. Waist of money or just not  my kind of music
I'm a "compleat" Beatlemaniac, and I don't mind the political statements at all, but this is a nearly unlistenable record that I have a hard time counting as a serious musical effort or even a real album.  I would have loved it if it had been a 7" single, "Woman is the Nigger of the World," with the rest of it just words written in liner notes.  After that opening track, the remainder is a serious chore to get through.  It's almost unimaginable that this came out between the excellent "Imagine" (1971) and the solid "Mind Games" (1973), but then again, John was not consistent, in part surely due to his apparent and admirable lack of commitment to being a pop star.  Love John for the genius he was, his commitment to peace, and the great music he made -- it's just that there's barely any of it on this particular record. 
I have a few minor quibbles with this razor, but it gives you a nice close, comfortable shave. And isn't that what we want in the end?  --- I don't know anyone who buys one of these things for its "ergonomic design features." It holds the charge for a good long time, and shaves your face nice. Rinse it clean with running water and you're done. That's what I'm looking for. ---  --- The only things keeping me from a 5 star review is I'm not yet comfortable with how the razor sounds when running. It seems like it's always needing a charge...but that's how it sounds at full charge. It will take some getting used to I guess..others might find the quiet running mode a plus.  --- Also, the monthly cleaning of the cutters/combs is a bit complicated.
You can read that the Eyetoy is a great "toy" in other reviews, but I just wanted to say that you can use it as a webcam on your PC by just plugging it into your computer's USB port
I am an avid golfer since the age of 18 and over the years, I have tried all the gizmos to get rid of my shots that drift to the right (or slice under pressure).  I have tried the Medicus, and still slice and other gizmos (swing jacket....junk) to no avail.  The swing setter worked for me.  It showed me a flaw in my grip (by the way, this flaw was not noted by several instructors and others I routinely play with) and also stressed cocking of the wrists to help get on plane.  I tried it and my shots immediately straightend out and now go straight or slightly left (still some over the top) but getting better every day.  I recommend combining this with the Swing Rite for a powerful swing.  You will still have to work with it a few times per week but it can be swung in the garage or back yard so you don't look like a goof on the range.  Give it a try, it is cheaper than most lessons and certainly helped me.  Good Golfing
I rec'd this today.  I had been looking for a while for a white faced stainless watch and kept coming back to this one from Bulova. (I looked for nearly two years!)  I did some looking around online and in stores and Amazon by far had the best price (they beat everyone by at least $100), so I did what any girl would do, I bought it.   ---  --- It is a substantial watch. It's not a watch for someone looking for something dainty or unassuming. I don't think it's heavy, it just feels like you've got a watch on.  I personally like the size and weight.  I plan on this being my spring/summer watch until it dies or something happens to it.  I have a Seiko Coutura with a black MOP face w/diamonds that I love, but I wanted something different but sort of the same and this one was it. 
This was a great sounding pair of headphones, however, after a couple of uses the right side headphone just stop receiving any sound.  Not sure of problem, but as I stated the unit sounded great.  That's why the 4 stars.  Refund received without any problem.  Not happy I had to pay for the shipping, which, was why I did not ask for replacement
I ordered the "fedora".  I am so dissapointed, it came off within a few hours!  Just peeled right off. Do not order this brand of fingernail polish. It is the worst I have ever used
Thought I'd try this tea.  Wrong choice.  Tea is not as good as Numi's Iron Goddess of Mercy Oolong tea.  Perhaps my favorite Oolong. Shipping costs almost as much as the tea on the Natural Chinese Wuyi Oolong.  I'll stay with Numi Tea from now on
I think its safe to say that this game sucks! Before I got this game I thought it would be great. I had heard so many good things about it. Once I got it though I realized that this game wasnt as great as everyone said it would be. The Graphics are ok but the gameplay and sound dont impress me at all. Plus you dont get your lightsaber until level 7 unless you use cheat codes. As for all the talk about you being able to use the force the force is pretty weak in this game. You also dont get the force until level 7 and on some of the missions you cant even use all your force power like lightning, push, pull, ect. Really the only good force power is grip.(Grip allows you to choke people)Another thing that sucks is that there are different powers of the force so when you finally get the force you have to build up your power of the force for a few levels (wich could take hours) to finally get your force power strong enough to kill the enemy, not just wound him. This game is also EXTREAMLY hard. Its like Metroid Prime were you can get lost and it'll take a long time to find your way around. If you still want to get this game after reading this review is suggest renting it first.(Dont Be Dumb like me and buy it without renting it. I wasted $50
I have very thick, very coarse, wavy hair. When my two year old CHI straightening iron broke, I needed to replace it quickly!  Locally the only iron I could find was the T3 Tourmaline iron, so I thought I'd give it a try.  It cost more than the CHI, was sold at a fancy salon, and could even be used on damp hair.  Surely it would be a good replacement. ---  --- Unfortunately, it failed to impress.  ---  --- -It did not leave my hair silky smooth.  While my hair was certainly straighter, it still looked coarse.  (This was on the hottest setting and with several passes over the hair) ---  --- -Because my hair is so thick, an iron needs to reduce the volume.  The T3 failed in this respect, too.   ---  --- -I thought I would like the larger (almost 2") iron surface.  The T3 has a perfectly flat surface, which made it impossible to get a flip or curl on the ends.  ---  --- Needless to say, I returned it quickly to the pricey salon and will be getting another CHI!  Perhaps this brand would work better for someone with fine hair, since the temperature can be adjusted
Russians and Yankees team up to save the world in "Meteor", one of the last gasps in the celebrity-disaster movies of the 1970s'.  (Like the "Airport" movies - you'd have a bunch of celebs tossed around for no other purpose than to have their headshots printed along a strip at the bottom of the movie poster.)   ---  --- In "Meteor", a huge chunk of an asteroid, blasted out of its benign orbit after by a wayward comet, is now heading towards earth.  Called "Orpheus", the chunk is 5 miles wide and promises to kick off a nuclear winter on arrival.  The only hope left are two space-based missile platforms lofted into orbit by NASA and the Soviet Union - each pointed at targets on Earth rather than into space.  (I don't remember if the platforms, named for Hercules and "Peter the Great" actually violated any treaties, but their owners sure seemed keen on keeping them secret.)  The Americans learn of the incoming asteroid first, having fatally positioned one of their spacecraft in the asteroid belt at the moment of the comet's collision.  They then learn that Hercules is "light" -they'll need extra missiles, and since they don't have any time to put new ones into space (and as Henry Fonda's president puts it memorably, they can't just "conjure some out of thin air") they'll have to go to the Russians for help.  Waiting for Orpheus to hit, the plot boils down to scenes of the scientists realigning their missile platforms away from Earth, and other scenes showing the devastation wrought by smaller "splinters".  (In an interesting move, there aren't any subtitles for the international targets.)  ---  --- Even if you find the special effects lame, the score annoying and the plot thin and holed as if it too was struck by a meteor, "Meteor" surprisingly gets some good mileage from its stars.  Sean Connery is great in a post-Bond role as the civilian designer of Hercules - a NASA fixture who resigned when his program was taken over by the military ("Hercules" was apparently designed just for this eventuality).  Brian Keith is also great as Dubov, Connery's Russian counterpart.  The script has most of the Yankees getting along with the Russians, so he's never a foil for Connery, but he gets some good scenes going from a genial to an enraged Soviet, improbably speaking all his lines in Russian.  Karl Malden also rises above what seems like an incredibly unnecessary role as a NASA bureaucrat - he's neither scientist, engineer or politician, but he keeps Connery's maverick in line.  Landau, a great actor, plays the thankless role of the cold-war hawk of a general who fears the Russians more than shooting stars.  The FX are actually pretty good for pre-CGI (mostly excelling in the space sequences).  The music seems repetitive, but Laurence Rosenthal's score is also evocative of the Russians and the oncoming Asteroid.  Much of the movie drags on and many sequences seem redundant. (Did they need all of the "splinter" scenes?  The "Avalanche" sequence is most ludicrous - the world is coming to an end, but there's no hint on any of the faces of those out skiing the alps in that sequence.)  That said, the plusses and minuses of this flick make it memorable, and the plusses make it worth watching.  The script places the control center for Hercules underneath the old AT&T bulding in TriBeCa, and I admit I can't pass the place without thinking of this movie
Now I try to limit my caffeine intake to the bare minimum, like in tea.  I do not drink coffee.  So when I took Stacker 3 (just ONE PILL) I was jittery and could not fall asleep.  I stayed wide awake the whole night and through the day.  I felt nauseus too.  Now this was probably because I don't drink coffee or anything that has a lot of caffeine in it, but I don't recommend Stacker 3 anyway
Try something different.  Forget microwave popcorn for a few weeks and try this four-pack just once.  At the very least, you'll have a new food experience, but what you might get is a new family tradition.  It's worth it. ---  --- My wife and I received a four-pack of Fireworks Popcorn last year with these four flavors, and because we are huge fans of stovetop-popping popcorn, it was a definite treat.  We love watching movies, and it's a weekend tradition to make a giant tub of popcorn and jump on the couch. ---  --- This 4-pack is a fantastic way to discover the differences in types of popcorn, and there really are subtle differences.  There is a description of the flavor on each bottle, and the bottles also tell you about the size and robustness of the finished product.   ---  --- As gourmet as any other gourmet popcorn I've ever tried, the kernels pop up nice and big and almost every kernel pops.  The flavors augment a good low-fat butter spray if that's your fancy.  I'm very much looking forward to receiving the 8-flavor sampler! ---  --- Personally, I pop mine in olive oil with a few dashes of garlic-infused oil and/or the red spicy olive oil and a little salt.  That is something you can't do in a microwave!  If you've never popped popcorn on a stove before and you're intimidated... no worries.  Pour in enough popcorn to cover the bottom of the pot, add enough olive oil cover up about half the height of the kernels, shake it over the heat until the popping almost stops, and pour out the popcorn into a bowl asap.  Practice makes perfect, and you don't need much practice at all... maybe just one try! ---  --- Honestly, for the labor of about 90 seconds on the stove and one pot to wash, you turn an evening of TV-viewing or movie watching into an event.  The kids will love it, and as a grown-up kid, I highly recommend it.  I have fond memories of my dad making popcorn for the three kids on Saturday nights, and this is a good product to make those memories
Orris Root powder has a scent similar to violets although in this Tisty Tosty bath bomb, even with the addition of rose oil, it is not an overpowering fragrance. I think they could add double the rose oil, but you can add in rose and ylang ylang if you are in the mood. The Tisty Tosty heart-shaped bath bomb is perfect if you enjoy blending your own essential oils or prefer a mild/calming bathing experience.  ---  --- I'd suggest using this one for skin calming and also adding in a "Romance In a Stone," "Sex Bomb" or "Chelsea Garden" bath bomb to add a little more romance to the bath.  ---  --- I did feel emotionally calm (rose balances the emotions) and my skin loved this bath bomb, but it was not as sensory as I'd hoped. Following this bath with the "It's A Pleasure Treasure Massage Bar" is fun, also heart-shaped.  ---  --- You may want to try the "Violet" soap with this bathing experience. The next time I try this, I might mix it with an "Elixir" bath melt and a bit of the "Bathos" bubble bar, also scented with violet.  ---  --- As far as this being a magic spell, you just never know who might call you when you use this bath. Probably right when you are in the bath. So, if you think this will work instantly, you might want to keep the phone by the tub. It was funny, but when I was in the bath, my husband was trying to call me and said he let the phone ring and ring. Did he really think I would leave the pleasure of a Lush bath to answer the phone?  ---  --- Personally, I think they should scent this bath bomb like the It's a Pleasure Treasure Massage Bar. It is blissfully delicious and almost seems edible - looks like white chocolate (it is mostly cocoa butter) and has a heady scent of orange blossom honey and neroli.  ---  --- ~The Rebecca Review
I subscribed to WS for a couple years in the late 90s, and loved the magazine. It keeps a balance between reviews of wines both new (which is the main emphasis) and older vintages, and background stories on vintners and so on. The writers are almost all very good (and I'm a professional writer myself) -- only one of them do I dislike and he doesn't review the wines. Both the wine connoisseur and the novice can profit from reading this publication. I only dropped the subscription because I moved and the collection, no issue of which I wished to discard, was occupying more and more space on my bookshelves.  ---  --- Now I subscribe to the online edition so I can check ratings before I buy a wine. The WS, in addition to Parker and other reviewers, perform an essential service for critical consumers who can't otherwise judge whether a bottle is worth the price asked. And we need WS and Parker and all to tell us when the best reds are ready to drink -- some really great ones are not mature for more than a decade. I drank the highly rated Chateau Canon 1982, for which I'd paid over $100, 17 years after harvest, and my group could tell it wasn't ready -- still closed down. Sure enough, if I had read Spectator carefully, I'd have picked another bottle for that occasion because they said it wasn't yet mature. ---  --- Robert Parker has the reputation for being more influential for high-end wines, but Wine Spectator's scores are generally pretty close to his. And they review a broader spectrum, as noted by other commentators below. WS will often steer you to excellent buys for under $15, or even under $10. If you get only one of these per month, or steers you away from a very overpriced bottle, the subscription (about $50) pays for itself
...if you don't use this stuff! After too many years of uncomfortable shaves and having to wait 2-3 days between shaving to let my raw, sore neck recover, I finally started to do some research into what I could add to my regimen/technique to improve results. I read numerous articles about the benefits of pre-shave oil, so I decided to add this stuff to my arsenal...and I'm NEVER going back. ---  --- First off, the price might be a detrement to those who are used to $3/can drug store shaving cream, but a little goes a long way, and this little bottle might actually last you longer than 4 or 5 cans of cream or gel. You only use a small amount each day, and it spreads evenly over your whole face. When used in tandem with a good shaving cream, it virtually eliminates razor burn and uncomfortable shaving. My razor glides over my face each morning now. If you look at your razor each morning with disgust like I used to, give this stuff a shot. I guarantee you won't be disappointed. Try their shaving cream and "old school" shaving brush as well. Pamper your face...this is how shaving was supposed to be before cheap aerosol shaving cream and disposable plastic razors started ripping our faces to shreds
That might be a little misleading -- the battle mechanics are almost exactly the same as those in the first game (heck, as in most of Nippon Ichi's games, though this series, I think, is the best of the lot).  That part of the game absolutely delivers: ---  --- - Great classes. --- - Good monsters, and a more consistent class sytem for them. --- - Excellent assortment of items. --- - Good variety of levels. ---  --- However, as far as the story -- an area in which Hour of Darkness was solid -- this game falls on its face.  The writing is iffy, the plot itself is contrived, the characters (while certainly amusing) are predictable, and it just leaves so much to be desired.  If you're looking for a storyline you can get involved in, go back to the first game. ---  --- If you're in it for the gameplay, though, don't miss this one!  With some class tweaks and a few added features, Cursed Memories is a worthy addition for those who simply want the monotonous level-up madness that some of us thrive on. ---  --- Great 2D art mixed with fun environments, HILARIOUS quips and item descriptions, engaging fights and hundreds of hours (literally) of entertainment
I tried with two sets of new batteries, the goggle unit flashed but no massaging action whatsoever happened.  Besides that, the design looks cheap and it feels very tight and uncomfortable to wear.  Avoid this item
Hazelnuts are tasty.  A 4-pack is twice as many as you'd expect as part of a single package
I purchased this bike rack because I was moving out of state and didn't have enough room in the back of my car for the bike.   --- I also needed a rack to transport my bike to local trails, parks, etc.  So, I went with Schwinn given the brand name and that it was relatively inexpensive.   ---  --- I drove from NC to Fla, approx 700 miles, bad idea with this rack.  I didn't have any trouble assembling the rack, only took about 5 minutes and was ready to go.  However, during my trip, I had to pull over on the side of the interstate no less than 5 times to tighten the straps back.  The buckles do NOT hold the straps in place.  This is a real problem if you are travelling on a highway (or any busy road) and you have to worry about your bike flying off the back into oncoming traffic.  Also, even if the buckles hold, The wind drag from the bike starts to pull the brackets right off of the rack frame.  I had to purchase 4 bungee cords and rope in order to secure my bike from flying off the back (and yes, the rack was assembled correctly).  Bottom line, this rack is probably a great value if don't plan on driving more than a a few miles or over 40-50mph, otherwise, it is a a complete waste.      
I finally got this cd, I have been looking for this CD for awhile now, a great by well worth it
i really like my new windows vista upgrade.the graphics are stunning and it is extremely user friendly.infact, i liked vista business so much, i upgraded to the ultimate version.both versions are very easy to install;many people seem to be waiting for 'all the bugs to be worked out' but, honestly, the bugs aren't a problem.it is important to run the advisor about -is your system ready for vista before you install- to get rid of any conflicts your computer might have with vista;other than that everything else is a breeze. Use my system about 6 hours a day and am using a xps 700 dell computer go for it, you'll have lots of fun!
I never wanted to waste my money on a manicure, because my polish would be chipping/peeling by the next day.  My pedicurist bet me that she could keep the polish on my manicure by using this stuff, and low and behold...it worked!  It kept the polish on for a week even through housecleaning and a trip to Vegas
The GOOD: We plugged in our new LNS2651D on 3/7/7, about an hour northwest of Tampa Bay.  Right out of the box,with an old Rabbit Ear antenna, we received five HD broadcasts.  The picture is amazing in both color and clarity.  The BAD: We reset the sound coming directly from its speakers, but because of speaker location underneath/below the screen,it lacks sparkle, esp at low to med. volume. The UGLY:  Imagine sending your intelligent,pretty young daughter out on her first date, with shoveled-on make-up, and wearing a cheap black vinyl dress.  The "Piano Black" case on this tv is a nightmare!  It shows a rippled effect, which gets distracting and even more tacky when outside light shines (even lightly) on it.  I'm hoping after the R&D department who designed the case, is sent to Siberia, they redeem themselves by designing a Matte Finish slip- cover for this otherwise excellent TV
Don't take my word for it that's a quote from the title of a recent post excoriating this irritating and increasingly bloated product on Slashdot.  ---  --- Be warned: Adobe has not learned its lesson, and despite the outcry that followed the release of version 6, this latest release of Acrobat continues Adobe's aggressive trend of intruding into your desktop environment, again, as in version 6 without providing an easy way to undo the damage once its done--in fact, it's now nearly impossible. Like earlier releases, this version of Acrobat adds startup macros and new toolbar buttons to your existing applications and adds menu entries to your desktop "right click" menus. Adobe argues that these are conveniences, but they are entirely unnecessary (for most of us "printing" to Adobe PDF achieves the same result, is much more convenient, and a more natural model), and clutter what for most users is either a too-crowded user interface (for those who don't have the knowledge or patience to customize it) or a carefully tuned one (for those who do). Unlike many well-behaved applications that provide obvious ways of avoiding this kind of intrusive and disruptive behavior (e.g. through a simple checkbox option in a settings dialog), Acrobat's "option" for disabling this behavior, once deeply hidden in the setup process,is now almost completely absent. To disable the "Convert to Adobe PDF" button that mysteriously appears in the Outlook mail editor, for example, one has to be sure to choose "this feature will not be available" from the "Microsoft Outlook" option under "Acrobat PDFMaker" under "Create Adobe PDF". Simply deleting the button using Outlook's toolbar customization feature will not work: it comes right back when the editor is next opened. Similar problems arise in Word, Excel, Visio, Project, and Internet Explorer. And there's simply no way to get rid of the never-used "Convert to Adobe PDF" and "Combine in Acrobat..." entries in that appear in the desktop context menus for files (even if one installs none of the Acrobat PDFMaker features).  ---  --- For the technically inclined wishing to repair some of the damage that Acrobat 7 does, there are complex but largely effective step by step instructions available on the web, but even the authors of these are driven to despair by version 7: ("Adobe has really pushed the boat out with Acrobat 7 and managed to screw Word royally") .  ---  --- In short, Acrobat will make a mess of your working environment, there's no way to completely fix it, and even the partial fix is a pain (and not well documented). (This may seem a minor issue, but if every application followed Adobe's reckless example, our working environments would start to look like strip malls, crowded with features screaming for our attention to the point where it is hard to find what we need when we need it. One of the great strengths of the personal computer desktop is that users can configure it in ways that suit their needs; no application should interfere with that.)  ---  --- Experienced Acrobat users will also notice that this version continues another frustrating trend for Acrobat (and most other Adobe applications): it is yet again slower to launch than the previous version. In fact, on my 2 GHz Pentium 4, it takes longer to launch than the entire Visual Studio .NET development environment, and longer than the boot sequence for Windows XP!  ---  --- There are other minor problems as well (arbitrary rearrangements of menu and tool bar items, etc.) but these two major flaws are more than bad enough. Unless you really need the latest Acrobat features, you should probably avoid this upgrade. And if the "improvements" in this release are any indication of where Adobe plans to go with future releases, it may be time to start looking elsewhere for a tool for digital document management.  ---  --- Fortunately, there's no reason at all to upgrade. Version 7 offers no usefully new features, so you can (and should) avoid this one (at all costs)
Wow, I have never seen anything like this.  It's worse than bad; it is virtually unplayable from a technical perspective.  At the very least, Amazon should refuse to carry it
I've had this watch for about 5 months now and the threaded crown or body stripped, so the crown no longer locks in place. I've tried contacting Citizen for waranty and they say it's not covered. Citizen claims that I over tightened it or cross-threaded it while screwing down, so it will cost $50-100 to repair.  ---  --- TOTAL JOKE! I'll never purchase a Citizen watch again. I've always thought they were cheap to begin with. This just confirms my thoughts
I am a huge fan of tea. I have been drinking this one for years. I am astonished at the price -- such a great deal. Anyway, if you must buy tea in a box, this is one to purchase. I love the subtle flavors of this tea. I always feel better after drinking a cup. It's even better if you add a little fresh (organic) lemon juice.
This UV filter produces high quality pictures at a fraction of the cost of many ather brands
I am 51 and recently visited an upscale retail store in Manhattan.  The Yves St Laurent gal behind the cosmetic counter noticed my complexion was a little sallow - put this product about an inch on each side of my nose and blended it in..what a difference it made...a worthwhile investment..I use it under my eyes and just about all over my face for a nice touch-up, concealer and brightener..covers freckles and sun spots, too
this is the worst piece of junk i have ever purchased, i cant believe it, please dont waste your time or money on this, it b    roke the second day, rubber bands poped man what a piece of junk  i rate it a fat zero but i only had an option to give it a one
Just got them in the mail today. As other kenneth cole reaction shoes, it runs one size larger. I'm usually a 12 but I ordered an 11 and they fit just right. These boots look great with jeans. The color is a bit darker than the one shown in the photograph.
I found the size range to be completely missleading. My child was just shy of 5 and weighs 42lbs. She is 42 inches tall and found herself to big for this seat. Her legs were right up against my seat and was very uncomfortable.  The bottom line if she is this uncomfortable at her age what would a 7 year old be
I purchased this game for my son and he loves it.  He plays for hours and really enjoys racing the cars.  I'm glad that we selected this game for him, he also has Underground - Hot Pursuit and he enjoys that one also
This is truly the best WIFI you can get on the market right now. Its lightning fast its 4 machines put into 1. Most importantly I've had the best gaming experience ever. Now i can host games on Xbox live without lagging the rest of my teammates and that is no fun. The Linksys WRT330N Wireless-N Gigabit Gaming Router is well worth its money and a great investment. I recommend it highly to anyone that needs a great WIFI for whatever reason
what a crock of ****. the only good thing is that it still has the story with tommy and thats it,,, the kills suck, the plot sucks,acting really sucks, and damnit no jason
For real, you gotta give this man props. I repect him and his music, but it's not my style. He still managed to make this a good album, so it's all good. Much repect. 
You can't beat this shoe for comfort, but they're definately cuter in the picture.  I thought they made my feet appear extra long and the heel didn't quite seem to fit the shoe.  I returned them. 
Unless you are interested in reading one chapter after another plugging Bear Spray, don't waste your time.  The stories are all re-hashed versions of nearly identical situations; Man goes into the wilderness-Man sees bear-Man uses UDAP Bear Spray on bear-bear retreats.  This book is one long advertisement for UDAP!!  My book was actually misprinted, missing 50 pages right in the middle.  Initially I wanted to return my book for a complete one but, after reading the rest of 223 pages, I didn't want to waste any more of my time with this ONE story
His basic thesis is that a liberal empire can be a greatly positive force in the world, and that the United States is already an empire, but that our inablility to acknowledge the fact leads us to waste our opportunities to be the afore mentioned positive force. Ferguson writes that America is plagued by an attention deficit disorder and too much love of the good life. Thus, we get distracted too easily from important events overseas, and when we do try to intervene, we want quick fixes and low costs. ---  --- I couldn't agree more with most of these points. As an American, I'm greatly ashamed of our collective ignorance. I hate feeling like a foreigner in my our country because I watch the news or can find Sumatra on a map. Also, the book strikes a chord with me because of my frustration with half measures in foreign interventions. Countless times, I believe America has done more harm than good by, if you will, talking the talk but not walking the walk. If we commit to something, we need to follow through. This is as true in Iraq today as it has been in the past. We've claimed to support democracy in Latin America, but then turned bannana republics into bannana autocracies. We greatly prolonged and increased Vietnam's suffering without changing the end result at all. ---  --- With all this commonality, however, there are a few leaps of logic that Ferguson makes that I can't bring myself to agree with. Basically, he didn't sell me on the thought that the imperial model is the best way to develop the world. How are we supposed to know what is best for everyone? Won't our own biases and self interests inevitably distort even our most altruistic efforts? ---  --- When Ferguson hold's up the British Empire as a model of success, I can't help but notice that the best results came only to those places of British colonization, with horrendous consequences for each of the native populations there. And the two greatest examples of beneficial American imperialism - Japan and Germany - were already highly developed before World War II, so it probably wasn't that much of a wonder that we were able to help them return to such a state. ---  --- Even if the positive power of empire is conceded, there are important differences between the state of world during the British empire and the state of the world now. It's a concern of immunity from repercussions. In the golden age of imperialism, Europe was in a kind of splendid isolation from its empires. Not to say that there were no reprercussions, but, with the only modern navies in the world, Europe was immune to any very serious threats. On the other hand, in today's world, as an effect of globalization, power has become more decentralized in some respects. Think WMDs,terrorists, and foreign investments in the U.S. economy, for example. Can America as easily afford to make enemies in the developing world as the British could? ---  --- In the end "Colossus" didn't settle any agruments for me, but raised new and interesting questions. It is a book that makes you think, and that in and of itself is worth four stars.
Not particularly musical; only 1 good track (Blues for Miles)..
7 out of the 25 disks would not write.  I didnt much care for the product considering this factor. 
I loved this phone, but after only a few weeks the button is stuck and the phone can't pick up.  I want it fixed but don't know how
Now I don't have to worry about a dead battery. Just plug the battery into the tender and I know the battery is going to be fully charged for the next start
Nice mirror.  Good magnification.  Solid construction.  My only change would allow vertical adjustability to allow flexibility in positioning on the wall.  I had to move a picture to position it at the correct height
I used Easy Creator 4 for years. Bought new computers so bought Easy Creator 6. It will not work on 2 E-Machines with XP. It wipes out CD rom drive so that it is unusable. I requested tech support 6/12/06. It's 7/15/06 and I am still waiting. I uninstalled it. I found Easy Creator 5 platinum on Amazon and ordered it. It works
Spurlock has brought new meaning to reality shows.  Constructive, insightful, inspirational, educational, and entertaining, these very interesting journeys had me hooked for 6 hours straight.  Just think what you could do with your own life in 30 days! Should be emmy nominated; it's that good.  Brilliant
I purchased this game when it was new, and my computer while meeting the requirements just couldn't run it. I put he game in a box and just a month ago found it again. The computer I have now should be able to run the game thrice simultaneously with all options on highest settings. Yet the game will randomly crash and cause my computer to restart and losing my 4mins to 2 hours work. I contacted tech support and got what I am now sure are just something for me to try until I quit trying and leave them alone. It worked. They win. They got my money and I got jack
These hair topia pills are nothing but garbage! Pure nonsense! Trust me, I know this because I used to buy them.  I first bought these pills last year in June 2005 after hair formula 37's unsuccessful promise of producing longer and stronger hair in the four months of usage. Well, these pills were not as expensive as the previous brand mentioned, and had promised also change dry and brittle hair into long and healthy, and it did absolute NOTHING. I said to myself, like hair formula 37, that maybe I just need to give this more time, so I bought a 2-month supply and gave it 3 months in all and there was no difference at all. This product might just work for others, which it has, but it certainly didn't work for me. I must admit that I brought this on myself, as my mother warned me not to buy these ridiculously expensive pill since they do nothing for hair that grows naturally anyway, and that if you really want to get hair pills then just buy them a whole lot cheaper in regular stores like Giant or even hair vitamins in the damn Dollar Store! Thus, I am here to warn others not to waste their precious money. And if you are going to, please don't do it on this site-you can buy this product a little cheaper at hairboutique.com.
Although a majority of readers obviously loves this book, I have to say that it really seemed like a waste of money to me. Our only daughter left for college this year, but fortunately I have trained her in time to be independent. If your kid doesn't have a clue how to live in the real world and if if you're still willing to do everything for them and not have them take responsibilities for their own lives, this book is right for you. Not in my dreams would I have made lists for her what to take because she can well do this herself! I do miss her and she misses us but that does not mean clinging dependency! I expected different things from this book, on a deeper psychological level
I bought a used flames strap from Eddie and it feels (and looks) great. I love it and my bro does as well, very good buy
I wish there was a space for zero stars.  We bought this frame for my in-laws for Christmas and it worked for TEN MINUTES and then died.  It was definitely a fault unit and gauging by the other reviews on here, others have had a problem with it freezing.  Once it does that, there's no fixing it, apparently.  Do some research and buy another unit; that's what I'm going to do
Great aerobic exerciser for the money and very lightweight.  Let cool down after using as metal does get a bit hot.  The plastic leg stoppers do stink a bit, yet the plastic will off-gas.  Works best on couch while watching TV/Movies.  For anyone who is disabled or uninspired to work out, I highly recommend this to help get you back into shape
 --- GOLF DIGEST is the big daddy of a well-populated family of golf publications. It's self-styled tag line--'The #1 Golf Publication'--is well-earned. ---  --- Where other weeklies report the golfing *news*, GOLF DIGEST is a monthly celebration of golf as life, or at least of the golfing life. It's golf-star-celebrity-packed articles tend to wear titles in the imperative ('Don't Stretch Your Wedges'), giving the sense that the golf world is populated by feverish self-improvers. ---  --- Even those of us who are less than bent on links glory, the photography of this publication looks extraordinary. This aspect reaches its zenith during the magazine's frequent published admirations of the finer courses around the world. ---  --- No doubt about it, GOLF DIGEST is a lifestyle magazine as much as anything else. Yet the semi- to really-serious golfer will find its pages rich with suggestions on improving his or her game. ---  --- GOLF DIGEST anchors the world of English-language golfing publications. Even better, you can frequently pick it up for the price of a few frequent flyer miles
This gauge works well and is easy to read. It seats well and does mostly what it should. --- There seems to be a lot of misunderstanding from what I have read in other reviews. Let's clear a few things up. --- First of all, you do NOT have to wait ten seconds between readings. You DO have to hit the recall button on the bottom between readings. --- Secondly, you DO NOT have to send the unit back to replace the batteries. The instructions VERY clearly state the model number of user replaceable batteries (if you were to read the instructions). --- The hose was flexible for me in 30 degree weather contrary to what I have read elsewhere. Maybe it gets stiff in really cold weather but then I use mine in the garage. ---  --- Very Nice Gauge
I REALLY like using this product. The color powder is very sheer and the shimmer powder adds just a subtle amount of sparkle. I like using this after I have applied a light amount of foundation in place of a powder which normally makes my face look older. The shimmer powder doesn't cake like ordinary powders do and gives my face a fresh look.
Service was very quick, and they were having a free shipping special, so it was very well priced
Ok, so I am not a big vampire movie fan, so maybe that had something to do with the fact that I thought this movie sucked. But I am always open minded to all sorts of films, so I thought I would give this one a whirl. It started out with some potential, but within the first 20 minutes I knew it was going to be hopeless. I should have just turned the darned thing off. It was so unrealistic (ok, I know it's a vampire movie, so what did I expect) but I just didn't believe that the main character (Kerr) would have done the things he ended up doing thru out the movie. And then the girl (Izabella Miko) who had about 8 lines in the movie; that was just lame and pointless. She must have felt like such a loser telling people, yeah, I'm in this movie "The Forsaken", and I'm in it almost the entire time...but....ahhh....well just call me zombie girl. Anyways, I highly recommend a pass on this one, unless you are a complete vampire fanatic
Carson McCullers, one of America's greatest Southern writers, was often misunderstood, as many people were put off by or unwilling to  deal with her (at the time) controversial subject matter. MCCullers used the grotesque as exaggerated symbols of everyday experience. The loneliness and isolation of her gothic-like characters were merely extreme examples of feelings we all have, though magnified and intensified to the nth degree. ---  --- Tennessee Williams, in his introduction to MCCullers' "Reflections in a Golden Eye", posed the question (in a mock dialogue) most people asked about writers of the 'gothic' school such as Carson McCullers, Flannery O'Connor, Katherine Anne Porter and Eudora Welty: "Why do they write about such dreadful things?" Williams replies, " In my opinion it is most simply definable as a sense, an intuition of an underlying dreadfulness in modern society.. Why have they got to use..symbols of the grotesque and the violent? Because a book is short and a man's life is long... The awfulness has to be compressed."  ---  --- McCullers, unlike any writer I have ever read, pierces the heart of themes such as love, isolation, and loneliness with her lucid, poetic prose. Tennessee Williams, in Virginia Spencer Carr's biography of McCullers summed up McCullers' writing as follows: "I have used the word 'heart', but it is not an adequate word to describe the core of Carson McCullers' genius....I believe, in fact I know, that there are many, many with heart who lack the need or gift to express it. And therefore Carson McCullers is what I would call a necessary writer: She owned the heart and the deep understanding of it, but in addition she had that 'tongue of angels' that gave her power to sing of it, to make of it an anthem.
If you like cheap furniture you'll love this boot. The slave labor used to make this boot was wasted
My "tween" daughter loves these Saucony Jazz shoes. --- They are comfortable and stylish. --- This is her 3rd pair. --- I'm glad that I found them online. --- They are both old-school and stylish
Mark L. Sirower's thought-provoking and complex book is actually a critically acclaimed academic study that challenges the reasoning behind corporate acquisitions. Pointing out that acquisitions usually devalue the acquiring companies (a loss from which they rarely recover), Sirower delves into management fundamentals and mathematical analyses to get to the bottom of merger and acquisition problems. Three detailed appendices feature plenty of financial calculations, performance measures and data from various corporate acquisitions to back up his assertions. We [...] recommend this book to those involved in mergers and acquisitions and to other readers intrigued by the inside view of this "carnivorous quest.
As a frequent visitor to the Himalayas and being closely in touch with both Tibetans (ordinary folks, not the tortured ones) and the Chinese, I find this documentary interesting but terribly one-sided. I have not met a single wealthy Tibetan in Nepal or India, who can swear to me that he will return to a freed Tibet, run by their government in exile.  ---  --- To be fair to the "experts", a lot of the evidence of Chinese violence against the Tibetans is real. I sincerely feel sorry for them and wish that they could somehow be compensated. However, the documentary gets emotive and it seems bent on presenting the situation in Tibet entirely from the viewpoint of the activists and other victims of Chinese aggression. ---  --- While it is true that many Tibetans suffered and died during the invasion and subsequent crushing of riots that erupted from time to time, it is unfair to assume that the soldiers and police were the only ones responsible for the deaths and injuries. Were there no looters, vandals, infighting? If you had ever witnessed these riots, would you think that more people might have been hurt or killed had the soldiers not opened fire? ---  --- It's also incredibly naive to assume that all Tibetans think the same. Even Dharamsala, the seat of the Tibetan government in exile is not without opposition, violence and even assasination. While I do think that most Tibetans are good Buddhists and nice people, the documentary seems to associate everything sinful with the Chinese and everything saintly with the Tibetans. This is something I find totally unacceptable. ---  --- A few snapshots of Tibetan mobs welcoming the delegates from exile tell us nothing. The documentary seems only able to find Tibetans who are against Chinese rule. They paint the picture that nobody in Tibet is happy. This is patently untrue. But then, this sort of thing sells in America. You have to have a demon, you have to have a damsel in distress and you must have the hero (America in this case). Otherwise, it just won't sell. It's not about compassion at all. ---  --- If you really want to be "illuminated", visit Tibet and Tibetan communities all over China and see things for yourself. That would be far more enlightening. Sadly, many journalists prefer to interview the wrong (right?) people in order to get a sensational story that will pay for the rent
Less a view from afar or broad exposure of solitude from the human condition, this book more aptly excerpts the author's personal conflicts with human relationships.....a one-on-one wrestling match with the Self with no spectators and no judges. The book is a good read for academic analysis, but not so fun for venturist philosophy
These only take 1 minute to make, the noodles are already expanded as in NOT DRY - They taste great and I dont feel like I just ate fast food when I finish one of them.. or two :
Only knowing Jack Canfield from the very successful "Chicken Soup for the Soul" mega series, I had no idea his abilities as a motivational mentor and coach.  Although this book title seemed to be directed toward business success, the gems of this book can be used in every aspect of your life.  This lengthy book is full of words of wisdom and wit.  Lines that will move you to tears of discovery or move you to change directions.  A absolute must read book for understanding the real you
I have a severe dry eye problem and i found in internet that a humidifier may help. --- I bought big one for home and personal for work. --- It's been 2 days and it's working fine
We purchased this gate for an odd sized opening, because it is expandable.  It attaches to both sides of the opening so you open it on either side.  We have the gate in a very high traffic opening, and it is not only easy to open and close, but has stood up to the bigger kids going in out.  In the evening when the kids go to sleep, we simply unlatch both sides and set it off to the side.  I love it so much, I'm buying 2 more to replace those pitiful pressure mounted gates we have. Works well to keep the dog contained from the baby area also. Quality, durable product.  I definitely recommend it. Target is the only place I have found this gate
put together well with a nice assortment of items in the bag, nice gift all by itself for the expectant mo
I watched this movie and it sucked,very slow.It might be a renter not a owner
The fact that they call this premier is a little overdone. The reality is that this is the "Pro" version with a few bells and whistles which in most cases do not warrant the additional price
The Sony STR-DG600 7.1 has worked as expected and is a high-quality system at a great price
A snap to install, my only complaint is that when you press the button to open the gate, it waits about 5 seconds before you can latch the gate again. ---  --- **PROBLEM** ---  --- Forget about using the remote if you have more than one of these gates in the house -- one remote will opena ll of them... pretty stupid design. :
This is an ideal movie for home theatre.  I grew up on a working ranch and Richard Farnsworth, James Caan and Jane Fonda are totally convincing as  cowboys and cowgirl. Jason Robards is utterly evil in this movie. I've  liked them all in several other movies but none are as good as this one.   The breathtaking backdrop and a really well written story combined with an  excellent array of talent makes this one of the treasures of my western  collection
The idea is good...but it does not sit well on oblong toilets. The adjustable step is a great feature as my sons feet could not reach the other step stools we have used before we bought this apparatus. --- Would recommend with round toilet only
I purchased this camera for my 6 yr old daughter. It isn't even good enough for a child's toy camera!  --- She had asked for a camera with a flash and screen for viewing what she had taken photos of. This camera looked like it would fit the bill. It was small and "cool" looking, had a dock (great idea), Li-ion battery (great idea) and a skin (great idea.) Unfortunately it lacks the ability to take decent photos in varied environments (We are not always outside in the sun!) If they would put a better camera in the same package it would become very desirable. --- Save yourself the grief and buy something else. I'm getting a 5MP HP (for less money even!
be forwarned, that this is more for isolated toning legs, arms, shoulders.hips,  rather than pilates workout. does not strengthen the core muscles like pilates does and may weaken them.  The trainer on the dvd has flabby abs, and thick torso,  rather than long lean muscles and core muscle strength that is usually found when doing pilates workouts. i found the equipment bulky and awkward to use, hard to hold my body in good alignment and almost impossible to do the exercises from my power center, very disappointed in dvd training that accompanies the set. and serious questions about whether this routine weakens the abs, after my experience with it and seeing the condition of the abds of the trainer.  It is not up to the caliber of what I have come to expect from pilates. also feel there is risk of injury related to difficulty of holding body in correct alignment, as equipment kept slipping down or up. Need to go back to the drawing board on this one, there are better, less expensive, better made options out there, with better training. Keep on looking.
More like 3.5. --- So. Half of this album is excellent. The rest is filler. But, due to "Times Like These", "All My Life", Disenchanted Lullaby (the intro irritates me but it gets better), "Have It All" (kinda sappy but I love the intro), "Low" (have you SEEN the video?) and "Overdrive" (again, kinda sappy but there's something about it I love), the album is pretty enjoyable. It doesn't compare to the first three, but it has its moments. The riffs are slightly heavier, most songs are pretty upbeat. "Times Like These" is an instant classic with awesome lyrics, while "All My Life" rocks harder than pretty much all previous songs. Kinda sucks how the best songs are/were singles, but if they had released other songs, no-one would buy the album. Mind you, my friend loves "Burn Away", so listen to the previews and make your own mind up
Tin container not laced in the plasic crap..  The tea is very stonge and not a mixture so you have to add flavors too it but it taste good plain too and is very strong.  Taste wise it's stonge with an inner spice like taste in it if you drink your tea how your supposed to -- not a gulper - chuckle.  It was less than what I thought from the other reviewer but it is so strong you don't need as much and I'd still have to say it's a great deal.  Just add a twist of your favorite herb like orange peal or ginger and this can be the making of a great exotic tea but the only thing it's missing is the organic seal of quality and then it gets 5 stars for proving it's grown under kosher conditions which is very important.  The tins are very nice to look at and I hate to thow them away.  Obviously they put a lot of pride in the product
The series just keeps on getting better. ---  --- The Bob Newhart show was one of the best comedies ever on television.   The other funny show was "Newhart", which I cannot understand why it has not been released on DVD. ---  --- The whole cast just clicks.  I wish shows like this were still on television. ---  --- If you enjoy a good laugh then buy this and the other sets! ---  ---  ---  --- 
I just wanted to write a little note about getting the case open.  I just received my copy today, and in my excitement discarded the darn instruction on how to open......I know you're all probably thinking I'm just stupid.....after realizing what I did - I'd have to agree!  :) ---  --- Anyway, if you pull off the "peel" tab and get rid of it - here's what you do:   ---  --- See that red tab at the top of the box/package?  Hold the case from the "spine" and pull the little red tab down.  I found it most effective if I used my thumb and index finger (I'm right handed) on the tab and placed my middle finger on the top of the spine, and pushed a little with my middle finger.  I've gotten so used to ink cartridges, and other items that have a "don't pull this yet" type of tab, I was a little afraid of touching it....until of course I finally found what I did with my "peel" notice and found I did need to pull on the little red tab.   ---  --- So that's all there is to it.  Again, most of you out there probably think I'm stupid - but for the one or two others out there that tossed that peel tab  - Enjoy.  I'm going to install tomorrow, and once I've used the programs I'll see about a real review then
Ordered mens 6.5 for my son, shoes are sized a womans 6.5 (say mens 6.5 on box and shoe).  I'm going to have to pay $6.50 to return them for a larger size.  Don't waste your money, Buy NIkes
I've done most of the Nancy Drew games now, and a couple CSI and Law and Order games. Nancy Drew has better graphics and is actually harder in some cases than CSI. I also had so many problems with bugs with the CSI and Law and Order games, not so with Nancy Drew. And a real plus is my 7 year old can play them with me
When I first played this game I was shocked. Just of how good a stealth game could actually be. Its realistic in its ways that you can hide in the shadows and use the enviroment to take out your enemies. Its really fun also, suspense is one of the main things that happens in this game. You only use two guns during the whole game, the pistol and the rifle that has attachments. Good stuff. All you need is that, and you can take out a whole building full of enemies. You have to crouch, and move slowly so the enemy doesnt see you. A very realistic game and im happy that this series of games got released. I highly recommend this game. Great storyline, and the last level is hecka hard!
I expected a fabbo edge-of-the-seat read.  What I DIDN'T expect was that this pomo thriller would provide a passel of top-flight management secrets to its unsuspecting readers.  From the opening pages of the book, as Wylie Jones prepares to depart on a "business trip" of unspecified duration, to the penultimate chapter, when a revitalized Wylie and his attentive amanuensis wrap up a deal on the Left Coast, this beach-bag zinger is chock full with the sorts of advice, hints, tips, and warnings that help to build healthy management brains in twelve ways!  Think of it as a kind of business allegory.  Wylie's cross-country odyssey is what might happen if Robert Fulghum were to meet John Gardner trundling down the road on his reality bike, set fire to Robertson Davies' beard, and then move on over to the Highway Hacienda for corn dogs and a brew with none other than Warren Buffet, Everyone's Favorite Grassroots Investor.  I totally LOVED it.  It gets my absolute HIGHEST rating
Although I have a bunch of things on my keychains, I've decided to start carrying this.  People make fun of me, but that one time you need such a tool, whether inside your vehicle or someone else's, this could save lives.  The punch is powerful and, unlike a standard metal punch that needs your force to break glass, this spring-loaded one is sure to work.  I tested it, but not on glass, and it springs powerfully. ---  --- The great sleeve/cover for the blade works well.  It doesn't slip off easily (in case it's in your pocket, etc.), but with a little effort, it pops off as needed. ---  --- Just wish I was able to get a single one in the bright yellow color (which comes in 2 packs).
Would the powers that be for heavens sake reissue the Stewart Granger version of "King Solomons Mines". He is Alan Quartermain personified and Deborah Kerr is a more than credible female lead. All else is dross. And while we are at it could we also have the same star casting in the fantastic "Prisoner Of Zenda". Stewart Granger like many of his contemporaries is under-represented in the DVD revolution.
I have to say that I was quite impressed with this fragrance. I tend to look the other way when a product receives a little too much hype or attention. I can't say that this cologne is worth a great deal of hype, but I can say that it has a pleasant and  --- disctinctive odor. ---  --- The cologne is not something you would wear on a daily basis, but would go very well with a suit on a special occasion.  ---  --- On the bad side, along with the cologne's elegant odor comes a slightly feminine aroma. While I am not one to prefer a "musky" cologne I could do without smelling like a woman. An additional downside would be it's high cost per ounce...  ---  --- Overall, since receiving the cologne as a gift, I am quite pleased with adding this fragrance to my collection. Good job Diddy Daddy Puff...
I bought this camera in february, and after taking 6 shots the camera almost died, I could review the photos I had taken, but when switched the dial to take photos the camera turned out black either the LCD/EFV, and only turned off when I removed batteries, I sent it to Fuji repair center, and got it back again almost one month later. then six months later the camera did exactly same thing, I haven't received my camera back yet, But I'm sure never will buy a Fuji camera again and of course my camera will died again in the next months after I get from the repair center and at the end of the day I will have wasted almost 500 dlls
I bought this phone as part of the Sprint/Nextel SERO plan. ---  --- I used it for about 14 days before deciding that it didn't fit my needs for several reasons outlined below: ---  --- - Battery life was sporadic -- I got maybe a day worth of power from it. One time it completely discharged overnight. For the price of the phone (and the two year contract it carries) this is a dealbreaker. ---  --- - The Nextel network coverage has gone downhill in my area (I was a former Nextel subscriber for 3 years - so I have some experience with coverage around town). I was getting disconnects and sporadic no signals. ---  --- - The phone would sporadically mute the ringer. An incoming call would light up the display but there would be no ringing. This seems to happen after I had put the phone on vibrate and then turned it back to ring. ---  --- - For the same monthly service fee, I was getting less access to web services and no high speed Internet ability. Admittedly the high speed access is not as useful on a tiny screen -- but if I'm going to be locked into a 2 year contract I would like to have some fast internet access on the phone. The i880 still uses the slow Nextel data network. ---  --- I was not a Direct Connect/Walkie Talkie user. If I were, then my opinion of this phone might be a little higher (since Nextel presently has arguably the best fully functioning walkie talkie network). I could not justify being locked into a 2 year contract with equipment that seemed sub-par on a network that did not (and likely never will) support the latest high speed technologies. ---  --- Below were my initial impressions during the time I used the phone: ---  --- Thankfully Motorola designed the phone so the micro-SD card is accessible from the outside -- no need to pull the battery to update the card.  ---  --- Here's the big things I don't like. ---  --- 1. You CANNOT use any mp3 songs that you transfer to the micro-sd card as ringtones.  --- 2. You also cannot readily load additional wallpapers unless it is a picture you took with the phone or a paid download. Any message (mms) that you send to yourself can only be set as a caller id image and not wallpaper.  --- 3. Battery life on my phone is flaky - I'm getting maybe a day and one-half with usage that approximates 60 minutes talk time and perhaps 6 to 10 picture messages. ---  --- You must pay Nextel to download ringtones. There are some users who have modified the phone and reportedly are able to use ringtones off their micro-SD memory card - however the process is more technical than what your average user might want to tangle with. ---  --- Note: Sprint and Nextel are both owned by the same company. If you're making a decision on Sprint vs. Nextel, there are only a couple reasons that I can think of to recommend Nextel over Sprint. First, if the Nextel coverage is better. Second, if you have a need to use the Nextel Walkie Talkie feature. ---  --- The Sprint side of the company features phones with significantly enhanced web browsing and higher speed data communications. The Nextel side clings to the larger phones and aims their services at the industrial/construction market. For almost every consumer, the Sprint side is a better deal. Sprint in my experience has better customer service whereas Nextel tends to transfer you endlessly among a variety of customer service representatives. ---  --- Here's my summary of this phone after using it about two weeks: ---  --- The Good: ---  --- -beautiful speaker phone --- -compact design / solid feel --- -2 megapixel camera, ability to capture movies --- -flip swings open when you push a button --- -Nextel sms/mms messages can now be auto-downloaded - I believe this is the first Nextel phone to sport this feature --- -nice loud audio --- -both Nextel walkie talkie and DirecTalk support ---  --- The Bad: --- -can't play ringtones off Micro SD or via any other non-Nextel transfer (Note: Technically some people have been using a Motorola product called webjal to make transfers with a cable - but this may be more technical than the average user would like to tackle) --- -Nextel is in my opinion on their way out as a carrier, soon to be completely assimilated into the Sprint side of things. While not entirely unexpected, it means that Nextel plans and features are not as attractive to non-construction users (Nextel's core group). If you want Mobile to Mobile unlimited minutes you pay more versus most Sprint plans which include them. Nextel doesn't have the super fast data speeds or network web browsing of competing carriers. Most web browsing on Nextel is limited to character based wap sites that both crawl along speedwise and present unexciting character based screens. --- -the phone is a little bigger that what some have grown accustomed to. --- -while not phone related, some users in larger cities have reported the iDen system is nearing capactity with a lot of busy signals. --- -I am only getting about a day of battery life - which is extremely low. --- 
Rarely do I write a review but this product is so bad I had to.  Expecting Sony electronics to perform well, what a disappointment, this one is a bummer.  Save your money.  There has got to a better under cabinet radio out there.  While the concept is good and the design sleek; don't be fooled by the packaging.  Nothing works well.  FM reception is poor, sound is terrible, controls are not intuitive.  To top it all off a year after purchase (yep, the warrantee just expired) the CD player decided to only play the first track of any CD inserted.  Forget listening to the rest of it.  This product is really ZERO stars.  I've tossed the whole works in the garbage
If you have an infant that enjoys mental stimulation, this item is not for you.  Since she was brought home my daughter has enjoyed looking about and being held so she can see all around her. She was bored to tears (literally) every time we put her in the lounger (the baby faces the ceiling.. not too exciting).  I thought it was a cool concept, however, my daughter did not.  She did much better in her papasan, or bouncy seat where she could nap if she wanted to, but have the option to look around and play as well.  Looking up at the ceiling was not fun for my daughter
I love this product - it's a lot more natural looking than foundation, and saves a step in the morning. It does a good job evening out skin tone, and it feels good on my dry skin. As someone who doesn't wear a lot of makeup, it adds that extra bit of "polish" that makes for a more professional appearance, without looking too made up
When you buy a Weber you want to protect it and the Weber Premium Grill Cover is a wonderful way to do just that. It fits like a glove and is very durable
I bought these shoes a few months ago because I liked the style of them. I wore them just about everyday. A couple of people started telling me "you walk kind of funny in those shoes". They caused my ankles to turn in.I was having ankle pain and my doctor confirmed it was from the shoes. The support (curves) of the shoes are poorly designed. I ran into another women wearing them and walking the same way. I asked her about them and she said she too was having ankle pain. I contacted the company who said I could mail them to the company (at my expense) and they would "inspect" them. If they felt it was a "manufacturers defect" they would replace them with the SAME product. Little good that would do. ALSO If they felt it was not a defect they would just send them back with a note explaining their decision.Don't waste your money and cause yourself pain too. The company may say "they stand by their merchandise" but they don't mean it!
Understand, I love Springsteen.  Born to Run is my second favorite album of all time.  I have seen him live over a dozen times.  I personally think he is the single most important American rock and roll artist ever (with apologies to Elvis, Chuck Berry and Dylan).  I even loved Nebraska, so don't tell me it's an E-Street band thing or a rock versus folk thing, but this album is unlistenable.   ---  --- Some reviewers have called it beautiful and powerful.  That's rubbish.  There is a complete absence of melody on this record, as was the case with much of The Ghost of Tom Joad album (with a huge exception being "Youngstown" - a great song).  The apparently willful attempt to alter his singing style to sound like Woody Guthrie or Jimmy Rodgers is just frightening.  Dylan could pull it off, Bruce just disappoints.  But it's the songs and lack of anything remotely resembling melody that makes this record a failure.  Believe, I listened to Devil & Dust 10-15 times in hopes of finding what I am apparently missing.  I couldn't. I thought The Rising was a nice album.  I even liked the Devils & Dust solo tour (Bruce is a powerful performer, and maybe even more commading when it's just him on stage), but I doubt this CD will ever find its way back into the player
I bought this for my boyfriend and he uses it for his facial hair and to shave his head.  Its very easy to clean and does a great job
It's a great new (at least for me) Crystal light flavor.  My husband loves it
Shoe pretty true to size, good shoe for the money.  I buy Nike Shox often and decided to try these for the price.  Not as cushy as a Nike Shox but also half the cost or less! For the price it is a comfy shoe and I would recommend it if you have wider feet and or don't want to send $90.00 and up for Shox
Once you see the book that accompanies this starter kit, you will realize two things. You won't be making sushi anytime soon without a few more items. Not only do you need fresh ingredients, you need things that are listed in the recipes to make Miso, to make Number-one Dashi and Number-two Dashi. You need Bonito flakes and kombu, you need things like bamboo leaves too. OK, so you don't need bamboo leaves, but having a bamboo plant around the house wouldn't hurt.  ---  --- The book is especially helpful, but to make the sushi rice professionally, you do need to also order a rice-cooling tub (hangiri). A square omelet pan is needed, but not essential. You can adapt by using a regular pan.  ---  --- Just add your fresh ingredients is the understatement of the year. You do get a sushi press, a sushi mat and Nishiki Sushi rice. The sushi Nori is essential as is the ginger, wassabi, soy sauce, rice vinegar, sweet wine (mirin) and white sesame seeds.  ---  --- Other items you will want to have on hand when this arrives:  ---  --- Chopsticks --- Ginger Grater --- Chopping Board --- Fish Knives (sushi knives) --- Plates for serving Sushi (not essential but make it more interesting) --- Skewers - for when you cook shrimp --- Rice Maker --- Stainless Steel Colander --- Wooden Rice Paddle - or you can use a wooden spoon ---  --- Ingredients:  ---  --- Avocados --- Cucumber --- Carrots --- Asparagus --- Chives --- Eggplant --- Daikon Radish --- Fresh Shiitake mushrooms --- Lotus Root --- Kombu --- Miso paste --- Ocha - tea --- Sake --- Shiso - an aromatic herb --- Snow Peas --- Sushi Vinegar called Awasezu --- Tofu - various types but Japanese Silken is recommended --- Wakame Seaweed ---  ---  --- Recommended Seafood selections include: Mackerel, Salmon, Crabs, Blue-Eye Cod, Tuna, Herring, Sea Bass and numerous other selections. I will be making mine with cooked fish for the most part and many of the recipes indicate cooking the shrimp.  ---  --- The book gives excellent full-color picture step-by-step instructions for preparing --- seafood. Everything from cleaning squid to angled cuts for sahimi.  ---  --- Prepare to learn an ancient art form. This is serious cooking with gourmet appeal. There are instructions for making garnishes and dipping sauces.  ---  --- The Tuna Rolls are probably going to be one of the first items to make because they have few ingredients and you don't need anything except a rice cooker, sushi vinegar and the rolling mat. The California-roll-style Temaki-zushi also look fairly tame.  ---  --- The Nigiri-Zushi made in sushi bars seem a little more complex. To make a simple Inari-Zushi you need tofu and there are extensive instructions for how to make the little packets or pouches for rice. These seem very interesting and I've tasted them before and definitely look forward to trying to make them.  ---  --- The idea of a Chirashi-Zushi rice bowl is interesting and does not require a great deal of artistic application.  ---  --- So, if you want to make a full sushi meal, it gets a little more complex, but you can try out various recipes and master the "dashi" which is like a fish stock/soup made with kombu and bonito flakes. This knowledge is of course needed to make the sushi rice, which leads me right back to needing a hangiri. I suppose you can use a glass bowl instead.  ---  --- This sushi kit is truly only a brief start to an artistic journey. Even after ordering this you may find you need a few more items before you can start taking steps in the direction of actually making sushi.  ---  --- I will report back as I try various recipes and all I can say is this will require an adventurous spirit and a few more Amazon orders. Once you have the Sushi book, things start to become more clear and you can make a list of things to order.  ---  --- ~The Rebecca Review 
we have the one with brown trim, but i had to write a review here too because we just LOVE this blanket.  it's super soft, the perfect size for swaddling, and nice and light AND still warm for baby.  we live in hawaii so we love how this blanket keeps the drafts off our son, but doesn't cause him to wake up sweaty.  it costs a little more than your average cotton blanket but it's COMPLETELY worth the money! i'd buy another in a second
Terrible as a musical toy.  My daughter liked the colors, but that was pretty much it.  It is difficult to squeeze the feet too.  Cute as a stuffed animal
Great fun for the family or a group setting.  We've had hours of fun
When my kids started kindergarten they needed to pack a lunch everyday. My wife realized that this was a teaching opportunity about nutrition, making the right choices, and responsibility. ---  --- Each day the kids pack their own lunches from Lunch Box Central. Each lunch must contain a protein (usually yogurt), a grain (some form of cracker or grain filled bar), and a fruit (apple, banana, or fruit cup). ---  --- EnviroKidz Organic Crispy Rice Bars are a staple in Lunch Box Central. They're convenient, the kids enjoy them, and they're a reasonably healthy choice. ---  --- The kids are happy, they're learning, and they're eating well. My wife is pretty smart
One of my FAVORITE Magazines! I would'nt live w/ out it!  Thanx!    Artchalet @ msn.co
The earrings were a gift and were most warmly received!  They were a real hit! 
This red curry is very good. It's nice and spicy which is what I like. The only thing that would make it a 5 would be a few more vegetables. Other than that, it's perfect
I thought this would be a great addition to our tub toy collection, I was wrong.  It doesn't work!!!! We tried shampoo and baby wash in it and there was no "mountain of bubbles".  This product doesn't work, save your money!!
Just returned the mobiCam- had poor reception, even in adjacent room! smallo screen & not stable - falls easy & seems like would break very quickly with a 3 yr old in the house!
My 3 year old is very interested in space and LOVES this toy. Having said that one has to make sure that her child plays carefully with it----the payload doors don't really close, the robotic arm is a bit hard to use and the satellite dish on the truck is difficult to put back on. Meets the need for a realistic shuttle, though
I have just purchased my second M407 Camera, yes that's right I said the second one. I purchased the first about a year ago and have used it in the Wilds of Idaho taking pictures in all kinds of weather at every elevation imaginable. All the pictures have turned out great. I recently had a reason to take more pictures indoors, new grand daughter. Again the pictures have been fantastic, have had several blown to 11X17 for matting and framing, great quality. I would make several suggestion to folks, buy digital camera batteries, every camera I have owned eats batteries, this HP is no different. If you spend the money and get good quality batteries they will last!  Second recommendation get a SD Memory card, if you are like me you will not be happy with the interanl memory and want to take lots of pictures.  So, this photographer says you can't beat the price, for the quality and service you get from HP. I forgot to mention I had a camera that didn't work, and HP replaced within 2 days with a new one, no questions asked. Good Service goes a long way in my book.  Buy one you won't be sorry!
I eagerly snapped up this ionic hair dryer about over a year ago because of it's retractable cord and folding capabilities. Even the price was attractive. It really did take up little room in my bathroom drawer and the retractable cord was a plus. I thought I had the perfect blow dryer because it did what it was supposed to do and quickly. Now for the bad news:  the retractable cord became chewed up and frayed after daily use and it became apparent that the cord was ultimately going to fray completely in due time. Then, the folding handle, low and behold, broke in half one morning. (Of course, the warranty had long expired). This dryer is too fragile to consider using on a daily basis and I consider myself a careful person when it comes to handling small appliances such as hair dryers. When I've replaced hair dryers in the past, it was been because they've simply reached the end of their lifespans and burned out.  I'd caution anyone to consider this before buying because these 2 features alone, while very appealing, can shorten an otherwise good hairdryer's lifespan.  I've now purchased a T3 Tourmaline (a featherweight, quiet hairdryer with no retractable cord or folding handle) which seems to work just fine and appears to have a much longer lifespan. 
I first heard about this product in a bad review of a different software product for converting LPs to CDs.  After a little research, I decided to try this product of the many that are out there.  This software is not expensive and for me, it does what I expected it to do.  It is easy to set up and use, and I am using it with an Audio-Technica PL120 turntable.  The first LP I converted was Stevie Wonder's Innervisions, and with this album in particular, the songs run together, i.e. there is no separation between the tracks.  This software allowed me to create fairly accurate tracks so I could access individual songs.  I also cleaned up some background noise with the "one click" noise reduction, and the music from this old album sounds great.  This is my first software for this purpose so unfortunately I cannot compare it to others.  What I can tell you is that it is inexpensive, easy to use, and it does what it says it will do
owned a different brand that was noisy and only worked for about a month......this winder i can not hear it run and have had it a couple of months....it is still running like clock work......would recommend to anyone that doesnt want to pay an arm and leg for one.....
I have yet to read a true Grisham thriller, but I plan to in the near future.  Having said that, I have no idea how this compares, but I didn't really care for it.  It's cute and has a sort of slapstick humor that I couldn't get into.  I felt like I was reading a teen or children's book, and I don't like feeling so patronized when I read unless I knowingly pick up a picture book ready for the simplicity of a good message--even then, I don't usually feel patronized or "written down to".  It's simple writing and a simple plot.  It's lighthearted and thus a light read.  I imagine many people would enjoy it; I just couldn't get into it.  :o
Beautiful and easy to use! The grater stays sharp after many uses and guests always ask about it. I wish it came with a dish to put the salts in. It would make a great gift if it came with a decorative dish
I have been buying tuners for 45 years.  I wish I had not bought this one. I bought it months ago.  I cannot open the battery door to put in a battery.  There must be some trick to it that I do not know.  I have lots of tuners and like to have different ones and I am hardly a novice. ---  --- Can't someone let us know how you do this
the band and face are both SO MUCH darker than they look in the picture.  also, amazon neglected to send the owners manual and warranty information (I had to contact Skagen for this).  the watch is very attractive though
BE CAREFUL - If you buy this version of Symantec Antivirus for Handhelds - --- IT WILL NOT WORK WITH MICROSOFT MOBILE 2005.  Supposedly Symantec Antivirus for Handhelds. Version 3.5 will work with Mobile 2005
There are 2 really good songs on here.  The first is "Untitled," which sounds like Gibbard was listening to a lot of Brian Wilson at the time he wrote it.  The percussion sounds like it could have been on pet sounds.  "Underwater" is a pretty good song...but the real jewel on the album is "Send Packing."  It really is a beautiful, well-written song.  The rest of the album sounds kind of thrown together and most of the songs would have been much better if they had been recorded with real instruments.  Basically, the novelty of the kid instrument thing wears off really quickly.  All in all, I wouldn't spend 10 bucks on it, but a couple tracks are pretty good
I was very disappointed with the quality of this product.  I had to request a second kit because the scented oils bottles were empty in the first kit.  The second kit also had the same problem.  Both kits had to be  returned. It is difficult to determine how fun this kit would be when it is  missing items within the kit
It is fiction of course. It can not be otherwise for what it contends may happen is IMPOSSIBLE! Many reviewers are upset. Upset perhaps but they should not be worried. The Church is protected by Christ's promise that it will not err. Any person of faith sees this book as FICTION. It is a poor attempt to disguise Greely's left wing theology as fiction. The message to those liberals who find "hope" for their cause in this book: IT AIN'T GOING TO HAPPEN. Recommended reading: "Women Priests And Other Fantasies" Greely and his followers are delusional
I love this scent. It smells warm and spicy on my skin.  The eau de parfum is strong, but not overpowering at all and the dry down is wonderful.  It also lasts all day long, which is great because I'm a spray it and forget it kinda gal.
About two weeks ago I got a very small metal splinter embedded in one of my fingers when I picked up an old office magnifying glass that had a corroded metal trim piece. ---  --- I used my conventional tweezers and managed to break off a piece, leaving an even smaller piece that I could hardly see still in my finger.  My conventional tweezers could only push it further into my flesh, so I quit trying to get it out.   ---  --- It wasn't doing any harm, surrounded by upper skin layers, so I looked for the best tweezers I could find and ordered these. ---  --- I got them a few days ago at work and within a few minutes I had that teeny tiny splinter out of my finger.  These are great
If you are shooting with a compact chip camera like the 20D or rebel xt, you will be happier with the 8mm fisheye.  This 15mm fisheye will just be a really distorted wide angle lens due to the 1.6 factor.  If you love the fish eye style and have that camera, you'll need something WIDER to compensate for your smaller chip. ---  --- I was disapointed with this lens for that reason.  The Sigma 8mm is great.  A note to the reviewer below.  Sigma makes some good lenses and bad ones.  This is a good one and you probably got a bad copy.  It happens often enough with sigma gear.  With this lens, its good to go and try one at your local camera shop and make sure it has the style you want.  Bring YOUR camera with a chip in it and take a few shots and go home to check them out.  Decide if you like the style and if that piece of glass is a good copy. ---  --- I got a good copy and was still disapointed because of my lack of knowledge.  Sounds like you got a bad one
I spent 3 days trying to get this installed.  I think the complication was that I had Norton Systemworks 2005 and wanted to add the NAV 2006 on top of it.  Well I finally got it done, but not until I'd restored my system to a backup from before I'd installed NSW 2005.  At that point I had NSW 2003 installed.  I had to manually uninstall that and remove tons of entries from the registry.  Norton's automated uninstall failed over and over so I gave up on that and did it by hand.  Then I installed NSW 2005 with NAV.  When I went to install NAV 2006 it was unable to uninstall the old version.  So I had to restore the system again.  This time I installed NSW 2005 without NAV.  I was then able to install NAV 2006.  It is working now.  It just shouldn't be this difficult
This is another nice Tinkerbell accessory for the car.  The graphic is nice looking.  The material appears to be good quality.  I expect it to last for some time
The product is probably a decent product, but it doesn't work in my vehicle, '04 Jetta.  I think it has to do with the part you plug into the cigarrette lighter being to long
I placed an order for these beans on March 4th. On the 14th march, I did not receive them as yet. Since the occasion that I needed them for has passed, I sent an email to JR to find out the problem. When he said they were not shipped as yet, I send 2 e-mails requesting cancellation-i sent 2 to make sure they got it and stopped the mailing of my item! --- He responded VERY hastily, as used sarcastic comments in his reply.The tone of his reply made me feel as if I did not know anything!! ---  ---  I am very disappointed with this whole ordeal!
I had to put this review in because of the unfair one previously given.  ---   Before I purchased this software, I checked out 5-6 of the major fish screensavers out their and this one is by far the most realistic, (movement, background, lighting, and noise).  I have two computers, one 800 mHz the other 1.4 gHz processor and the program runs perfect on both.  The goldfish screensaver is just as impressive, if you're into that kind of fish.  Don't let other marine/freshwater screen savers fool you by advertising more fish and backgrounds, the quality in all aspects, especially 3d-graphics and color (which are a must if your looking for realism), are poor.  I personally thought I'd like the extra fish and backgrounds (turtles in particular) in a competitors screen saver, so I purchased it instead of this one.  After trying it, I was very disapointed and luckily I was able to receive a refund.  I purchased Marine Aquariun and have never regretted it since.  What's great is they have a demo on their website your can try out too
Love this game. Great story line. Just make sure your computer can handle it
I purchased this bike from a local dealer 15 months ago and it has broken down 3 times in the last 15 months. The resistence motor is defective which is what I have had replaced 3 times now. This motor does not allow you to change gears or bike through a program--upgrading to shifiting on the fly technology would be a plus.  --- The positive aspect of the bike is the comfort and grip heart rate monitor and the ability to swap out saddles also a plus. Ovewrall I cannot recommend this product.
It's OK that helps to moisturize the skin, --- but it's just stays oily and cannot be absorbed appropriately in the skin. --- 
This is a well done game, especially if you liked the movie.  Characters voices and behavior are consistent with the movie and there's a cute storyline to the game. ---  --- There are a number of stages that you follow in order, completing one to move to the next. ---  --- There's a pretty small age window that its good for -- I'd say about 6 to 10.  Under 6, the stages are too hard.  Over 10 they're sort of easy and not that engaging -- you can fly thru pretty quickly. ---  --- It would be a bit better if you could jump around and play the "games" that you enjoy instead of having to go sequentially, but it's still well done and worth buying
Shameless rip-off of "Jungle Taitei" ("Kimba the White Lion") by Tezuka.  Any anime lover can tell.  (Similarities in characters, scenes, and story lines are unbelievable.)  Disney's response?  "Never heard of Kimba."  Oh, purleese.  I'm kicking myself for paying Disney for this piece of swindle
Note that in my previous review, in which I commented on the dreadful DVD  transfer, I was only referring to the "That Touch of Mink" DVD.  The Father Goose DVD is not that bad
The size is bigger than i thought but i loved it.  My son fits in nicely
I first tried these in South Africa. Now my best friend will ship some to me with packages that she sends on my birthday or other special occasions. I LOVE them! I want to have them here in the States!!!
This is a beautiful piece of B-B-Q sculpture and gets one star for looks alone, but it bends too easily at the 'neck' and I'm already looking for a replacement after using it only 2 times!  Looking back at the original information, it stated that there is a lifetime guarantee against defects. I wonder if a snapped off head would be considered a defect. I will let you know what happens. Too bad about the brush. It looked so good with my stainless steel weber...
Bought 2 different monitors; this one has great features such as the motion sensor, auto and scan settings. The night vision is weak but daytime looks great. Better reception than the other video monitor I bought but not having good night vision is a drawback. I really bought the video monitors for keeping an eye on my mother who has alzheimers but using the 2 cameras comes in handy for both baby and mom. None of these seem to be as quiet as just a regular baby monitor without video but it is very comforting to see and not just hear. It is the best one that I've found on the market
The title says it all.  This product does not offer much in the way of control and it is definitely not firm.  Basically you are spending $35 for a high waist brief
I am a native Memphian and familiar with Aunt Lizzie.  Aunt Lizzie has outdone herself with these crunchy delicious cheese straws.  You must try them!  Well worth it for your favorite low carber
The Truth About Cats and Dogs is a thoroughly enjoyable, refreshing movie. Janeane Garofalo uses her bread and butter acting technique of playing a cynical, depressed, miserable, pessimistic character who sees herself as an ugly duckling who no man could want.  ---  --- Of course, she's not really acting. That's really her: lock, stock, and barrel. The miserable, pessimistic, vicious act isn't an act at all. ---  --- The fly in the ointment to this movie is that Uma Thurman is not a knockout. Of course, some men would prefer the tall, thin blonde over the short brunette, but the basis of the movie hinges on Uma being the gorgeous woman and Janeane being average. But it doesn't work when you believe it's the other way around. Uma Thurman has certainly looked good in some movies, but she looks haggard here. ---  --- Bottom Line: A good film about the "ugly duckling" getting the guy. Based on the classic Cyrano de Bergerac story, just like Roxanne starring Steve Martin
Citylips has made my lips larger! i love the clear i use it all day long. i will buy this product again
This perfume is very mediocre. One of my friends loved it and on the spur of the moment I decided to give it a try. What a waste! Its not unpleasant but so unremarkable that 10 seconds after spraying you forget what it smells like. Wouldn't be buying it again
I purchase this by the picture inside it shows little closet type places and a bar for hanging clothes, none if this is there, its cute but I would not recommand this procduct.  the picture of the inside is false. It's not even close.
From the manic whirlwind Prelude to the shocking Cake and Sodomy, Portrait of an American family is an album that stands on its own two feet as being catchy and memorable. Cake and Sodomy dishes out the obscene gestures, Lunchbox is told with a twist of humor, Organ Grinder is pleasing vocally, Cyclops is addictingly wild, Get your gunn is catchy (if not overly insulting), Dope Hat is great and fierce, and My Monkey is hysterically enjoyable. Snake Eyes and Sissies is another winner, easy to get lost in. The rest all work to varying degrees, though not as appealing. Every song on this album is worth listening to, from fast paced and rock style to techno overload.
Don't waste your time or money with this DVD.  The best part of the DVD is probably the Trailers and most of those are Garbage also.  My DVD came loose in the package and scratched, too bad it didn't do any damage to ruin the Movie.  I couldn't wait until the Movie was over, I would have stopped it earlier, but wanted to see if any damage was done.  You'll be counting the minutes and seconds after watching the first half or even earlier.  The last story was stupid and horrible and should have been left off.  Don't waste your money, spend it on the cheap $5-6 horror DVD's, because at least those can be somewhat entertaining
My son is currently 4 months old, and this is currently his favorite toy. He loves to watch it, hold it, and chew on it with his gums
This is a very basic holster, and often simple is best - but not this time. The good news: the 8700 slips right in and out with ease, the swivel works great, and the clip is reasonably secure. A minor issue, becuase its plastic, when the virbrate "ring" is active, it makes an annoying rattle sound.  ---  --- The real problem is that the 8700 is held in the case by two flimsy plastic tabs (one on each side). Everyday use must weaken the plastic, becuase after about two months one of these tabs broke on my case, which meant that they 8700 would not stay put. It slipped out and fell to the floor several times. I replaced the case, and a month later, the tabs on the new case broke too.  ---  --- Due to cheap build quality, I'd suggest you look at third-party case options instead of this one. 
This is a great toy that lets childrens' minds grow.  Both ,my 7 and 5 year old love to play with this toy.  The magnetic base is so strong that you can build the metal peices ontop of each other to make a big sculpture.  I would highly recommend this
I've used the past few versions of Acrobat and this one is a disappointment. Navigation is a pain. Instead of the familiar window and arrows at the bottom of a page Adobe's engineers have moved navigation to the top of the page and have only a single arrow.The whole look and feel is most unMac-like, more like a windows application. I suppose if I wanted to take the time and energy to study the user manual I would find the application friendlier but I don't expect to have to re-learn to use an application when I upgrade. If you're thinking of upgrading, my advice is don't
How dare you compare Oasis to Phil Collins. Phil Collins sucks and Oasis rules! How come you don't get the message? You're retarded
After being an amature photographer via print film, I decided to try a digital camera - though I've been leary about printing quality.  I knew I couldn't afford a digital SLR, so I opted for a "snap shot" camera that I thought would have enough features to satisfy me.  However, after having and using this camera for a year now, I am so disappointed in the performace- the flash is just way too much, its a washout.  After being used to print and picture quality in my film SLR (Cannon, I might add), I was so severely annoyed with the quality of the pictures with this camera, I wish I would have just saved my money for a digital SLR. 
This book is a rare but insightful look into the practice of one of the New Urbanist legends. UDA began the pattern book revival a decade ago (and also has a book out describing the process of writing one.) They also are one of the pioneers of the New Urbanist revolution, which, by discarding the fictions of Modernist planning, have rediscovered existing methods and have discovered new methods of creating compact, mixed-use and walkable neighborhoods that were always the basic cellular structure of cities from the dawn of time until just before World War II. We have understood the basic principles again for some time. What this book shows are some of the mechanics of how to do it again
My Mom wrecked badly on this the first time out, due to the difficult-to-control steering.  Very awkward handle bars...several of us tried to ride it.  My friend--a fitness pro & personal trainer--put it best by saying "That's the most uncomfortable bike I've ever ridden."  --- Mom ended up giving it to a charity bike drive.  I hope somebody likes it. :-
I was unfortunate enough to have stumbled across this in 2004.  I was thinking it would be a good sit down and watch type of movie, but it was really lackluster.   ---  --- The acting is wooden, the script is very lame, and worst of all, the action isn't very exciting.  I expected a much better movie from director Richard Donner.  There is a battle scene, and there are action scenes, but they just aren't exciting.  When the action isn't exciting, you better have a good story.  The story here is alright, but certainly not enough to save the movie. ---  --- I don't hate any of the actors, they are decent when they have something to work with.  Here they had nothing to work with, so they obviously didn't do too well this time. ---  --- This really isn't worth your time.  I gave this to the thrift shop after I got it, and I feel sorry for the person who bought it there
I love these inserts!  I had trouble finding ones this size.  Not too big, not too small.  They definitely help me to fill out my bras!  I would suggest putting them in bras with pockets for inserts.  I tried just setting these in my bra, but if I moved my arms up and my bra moved around, I was afraid that the cupcakes would fall out.  These are a great product though
I love Cinderella and try to see them live whenever they're in town, but the sound on this DVD is just horrible.  Didn't anyone listen to it before releasing it? The video quality is fair.  They sure didn't spend a lot of money on production here.  I was very disappointed and wish I could get my money back
My husband and I just bought the Family Feud 2nd Edition DVD TV Games. ---  --- I have to say we both LOVED this game when it was first on (and on GSN as repeats) and I like the computer version. ---  --- We played this once by ourself and a couple of times with friends and we all have found that this game was boring & as someone said they can't believe they put this out. ---  --- If you are going to get this game then buy the computer version. ---  --- You have  --- 5 rounds ---  --- Round #1 --- Round #2 --- Double Money Round --- Triple Money Round --- Fast Money Round ---  --- You have Team A and Team B. ---  --- If you get one wrong answer and you click wrong then it says go for steal. --- HOWEVER, you only get one X. ---  --- Per Guide...IF an answer is revealed that Team A did not have written down, they press Wrong Answer button and pass the remote to Team B. --- Team B now has the opportunity to steal the round. ---  --- So most of the game was passing the remote back and forth. ---  --- IF the steal answer matches any one of the remaining answers they steal the round (even if you-Team A had that written down) and takes the money for any answer the other team has answered correctly (even if they got 4 out of 5 and both Teams say have the same answer) ---  --- The game itself was simple and basic. --- There was no real fun to it. ---  --- We tried to play it with others and they said afterwards that they found it boring and not all that fun. --- One person said they would have more fun watching the game itself on TV over playing this version of the game. ---  --- You get two markers (red and blue) to write on the two wipe-clean score cards. The negative on this is that the markers do not write all that good on these cards even though they were meant to. ---  --- Another thing is that the same game will come up more than once. --- We had the same question and answer come up even though we only played twice. ---  --- This is the 3rd or 4th DVD game we have been given or bought. --- This is the only one where we disliked it so much after playing it a couple of times that we are giving it away as we will not be playing it again
The lady can sing, but her "Christian" message is compromised because of her part in "Chasing Papi", where she played a woman who - had she had the chance - would have hopped into bed with her on-screen boyfriend prior to marriage.  It's "Crystal Clear" to me that Jaci broke my heart in a million pieces when she played that part.  It's really tragic to see such a beautiful young lady with such a opowerful voice and message now reduced to nothing more than a hypocritical wannabee, much in the same way that Stacie Orrico is now becoming.....and is it just me, or is it coincidence that these two womens' album covers look strikingly similar?  It appears their paths in life are similar, too: compromising a message and a stand that once set them worlds apart.  As with a recent review of Orrico that I made, I'll give Jaci Velasquez her due:  she can sing, and what I mean by that is sing the roof off of a house!  This album was excellent.....was.  Now, whenever I think or hear of Jaci Velasquez, I can only think one word:  HYPOCRITE
As someone well versed in various kinds of literature, someone who has read (and enjoyed) almost all of Tom Clancy's novels, and as a professional videographer, I have to say, this is a great flick.   ---  --- For those who are upset about the adaptation, what do you expect?  When taking an 800 plus page book and condensing it down to a two hour movie, some things are going to change.  The second and third Clancy movies- especially Clear and Present Danger - were also adapted to give Harrison Ford the action spotlight.  But now that Ford is ageing, Paramount (who after all, is a business needing to turn a profit) needed to re-invent the franchise.  The move to make it not just a new actor, but to show it as the start of Jack Ryan's career was cleverly done.  Most of all, it held true to the idea of the book, that when we base our actions off of our fears and suspicions, our peace can be torn apart by a few depraved individuals.    ---  --- This movie falls into the category of action/thriller.  As such, not everything is true to life, but instead is designed for entertainment and suspense.  And it delivers.  For something in the action category it has a remarkably intelligent script.  It's a little slow in the beginning for those who are looking for nothing more than explosions and shootouts, but it's worth it.  It also has better than average cinematography compared to most action flicks.  The effects are well done and not at all cheesy, as many action flicks have taught us to expect. ---  --- The acting is well-done, with a typically good performance by Affleck and a stellar performance by Freeman.  The soundtrack is also fantastic, especially the rendition of the national anthem at the football game. ---  --- Bottom line, if you're a reader who expects movies scripts to be written like books, don't see this movie.  If you accept that literature and movies are entirely different formats of entertainment then you'll probably enjoy this movie, and it is certainly worth ownin
had to switch bands , standard band had patent leather look to it. scratched from day one. i can't understand why a $150 sport watch would not come with a mineral crystal face . i've had $50 nike watches that were scratch proof. after changing the band the watch is pretty functional and cool looking, but still can not replace the convenience or functionality of a mounted computer for biking
I had always suspected and recently found out that Elle uses a different kind of (at least) paper for the cover of the editions it mails to us subscribers. While the Elle magazines in bookstores, supermarket etc. have thick, glossy, high quality paper for their covers, the managazines I received in my mailbox has a dull and thin cover. I guess the company wanted to cut cost, because to remain competitve, they were forced to offer subscribers a deep discount. Still, it's cheating
This pendant looks great in the picture but when I received it, it looks like yellow glass, doesn't look like a crystal at all. I'm very dissapointed
My mother is an avid world traveler and is quite particular about how she travels. So, I bought her the cabin cuddler for her birthday and she loves it! And I quote "It is practical and functional and makes a huge difference (re: comfort) for those long international flights." Big hit!  ---  --- 
I had the same problem with Works Suite 2002 that I had with 2006.  The product key that came with the discs would not install Microsoft Word;  the message "invalid product key" came up.  After a computer problem, I reformatted the drive and did a reinstall from the original Works 2002 discs. The invalid key message showed up when I tried to install Word 2002.  After arguing with Microsoft people for three weeks I bought the new Works Suite 2006.  After running all the discs to a clean hard drive, everything worked except,again,the invalid key message came up and wouldn't activate Word. Highly irritating.  I got it going by to Microsoft Works, Programs, clicked Word Document, got an "activate product" and got Word installed and running. This seems to be a dumb glitch in the software
I'm sorry, but WHAT on God's Green Earth are these people talking about when they say "the highest quality wholesome ingredients???"  The first ingredient listed is corn syrup, followed closely by sugar.  God.  I'm livid.  Corn is a subsidized crop in this country and corn syrup is a MAJOR culprit in the obesity epidemic.  Spare yourself.  Eat a damn piece of fruit. ---  --- Many Thanks, --- The Food Zealo
I love garlic and have never found a great combination that has few calories and sodium. I put it on everything.
With beautiful photos of the range of Niki's work, this children's book enables both kids and adults to get an overview of Niki's work, especially her sculptures. This is the only book I have found that has pictures of her Escondido work-- it is a magical place and one can get a feel for it through this book
I bought a couple of pair of these for my wife for "everyday" ear rings. The tiny stone fell out before she could wear one pair. The earring is so small it makes it difficult to get on. DO NOT BUY THESE.
Nizoral Anti-Dandruff Shampoo seems to be a very good product. I noticed a difference the first time I used it -- there was no residue on my scalp, and my flakiness was greatly reduced. It produced a very rich lather, also. The only thing I didn't like about it was the possibility that I'd have an allergic reaction to the ingredients, but the instructions didn't tell which ingredients might make this happen. I, myself, am sensitive to many products, and didn't have any reaction to the ingredients of the shampoo. I would recommend this product to others
The gameplay is just foolish and found the game annoying and un-fun!  The kids didn't even like it. Run, don't walk away from this dentist-office of a game JAWS-cr@p. (JAWS = Just another W. Smith
I used this to get marks off my washer and dryer and then went on to clean the rest of the house!  This little "sponge" is awesome, and it is just like a sponge; it's not abrasive.  The only problem I see with it (and all cleaning products) is that you actually have to use it for it to work; lol
Installation time was only about 20 min. Hook up the Digital and analog cables, and it configures itself. It took me a while to decide which resolution to use that was best for me, but once I found it, I was really pleased with the size and clarity. Music composition is much easier with the big screen. One small con was the stand is not adjustable, but it fit perfectly into my office space, so I didn't need the adjustment. The video quality on this LCD is amazing. --- Ronnie Be
We bought this for a trip we will be taking in May but when my daughter saw it she got in it immediately.  She wants to sit in it to watch tv, take walks or to put her dolls in it.  The light weight makes it easy to take and use in more places for me.  This helps with my back problems since I am more likely to have a stoller with me now.  It is easy to open, shut and lock.  I do wish that it had a place to hang or store a smaller baby bag though.  I also like that the ride is smooth for Victoria and she has the option to reclined or sit upright.  The large padded hand grips help to have more control and comfort with the stroller also.  
This was the first VI Warshawski book I ever read, and it did an excellent job of whetting my appetite for more.  I think Paretsky did an excellent job of drawing me into VI's world, which is rich with unique characters.  VI comes across as individualistic and principled, and I like how Paretsky resisted cliché temptation on several counts: the complex issue of chemical responsibility is not wrapped up in a tidy bundle by the end of the book, and there is no "obligatory sex scene."  Not that sex scenes don't have their places, but I just hate it when I'm reading along and I can almost hear the agent say, "Okay, author, you need to steam this up a bit right here if you want to sell this book."  In this story, VI is all business, which is a delightful change of pace
Reality Bites seemed fresh when it was first released, giving voice to a generation - with the unfortunately derogative soubriquet of "X" - that was overeducated, underemployed, plagued by the flashy, trashy commercialism of MTV, and stunningly superficial in its wholehearted embrace of pop culture and rejection of serious moral or philosophical discourse it might have stumbled across in college.   ---  --- It was a good start because transitioning from the idyllic and unreal world of college to the crass, cruel arena of materialism can be tough, providing limitless opportunities for challenge and personal growth - the very stuff of real movies.  Instead we have a swan dive into a Pizza Hut commercial held together by a plot so shop-worn it would have been considered exhausted in 1930. ---  --- Winona Ryder is winning as Lelaina, but one can only imagine the SATs of football players at a college where she is valedictorian.  Her "documentary" is appallingly narcissistic, reflecting the characteristic Gen X notion that - "if it's about me, it's art, and it's important."  Ethan Hawke does an excellent job as Troy, the very archetype of self-satisfied, supercilious entitlement.  We are expected to root for him, but it's hard to refrain from hoping he gets hit by a bus. ---  --- Stiller, who directed - a talented fellow almost impossible to look at - plays Michael, the "anti-Troy."  Smooth, successful, and very much plugged into the contemporary franchising of Gen X culture - if culture is the right word - he's an executive at an MTV-ish corporation.  That he improves Lelaina's preposterous "documentary," rather than destroying its alleged artistic integrity, is the film's dirty little secret. ---  --- Viewers surprised by who wins Lelaina's hand will also be stunned to learn that professional wrestling is fixed and Liberace was gay.  Indeed, when you strip away the thin veneer of pop culture references this is really a very traditional movie.  Janeane Garofalo is outstanding as always, and John Mahoney shines as the TV morning chat show host who looks sweet and avuncular on camera but is in fact, a bastard.  His performance says more about the likelihood of finding anything even remotely resembling reality in film - or on TV - than the rest of this film put together. ---  --- In fact, reality is great, this picture would have benefited from some
Rice paper crumbles off-- possible due to product being very old or improperly stored. Disappointing
You don't even need windshield wipers with this, and given the fact that the Arizona sun usually ruins them before needed, this is a very good thing
An absolutely lackluster effort from some very talented musicians. ---  --- I gotta say, I could have used a little more cowbell
The songs are boring, the lyrics are plain. I am so dissapointed. I bought it without listening to it first thinking I would at least find one song. How wrong was I to find out that not even one track speaks to me. Andrea's solo album sucked. Now this! I think their creative days are over and if I see them in concert again, I hope I am not tortured with the music from this new album. Instead I hope they play the oldies but goodies that characterize them as the band I love so muc
This was a WHOLE lot cheaper than the Verizon dealer wanted for this product.  My only disappointment was that it didn't have clear instructions, which was LG's fault
I was suffering from intense neck and shoulder pain before I started using this pillow.  When I started sleeping on it a couple of months ago, the pain was gone after the first night, and it hasn't come back since then.  It supports my neck perfectly.  I highly recommend
If you are trying to buy a decent set of pearls and don't really have a good frame of referance - these are for you. My wife was a jewler and she likes pearls. I bought these and got positive feedback. I was nervous but when they showed they were heavy and looked great. You will be OK if you go with these
I was extremely disappointed in this "upgrade".  I had Roxio's Easy CD Creator 5 and loved it.  That product allowed you to easily arrange your music on the dics, burn it, then create a lable or insert for the disc with almost no effort.  Almost everything was intuitive. ---  --- Creator 7 is a big step back in ease of use and utility.  So they added a few new bells and whistles, so what?  The base use of this product is to make music cd's and to create inserts.  Arranging music is not as easy as it was before.  And the insert creator is so frustrating to use I don't bother. ---  --- In fact, I have continued to use Creator 5 and have simply written off the fact I paid $100 for Creator 7 - for nothing! ---  --- Now, with a computer upgrade, Creator 5 no longer works.  I don't dare try another Roxio product (just read the reviews for 7.5 and that appears to be a total waste of money).  I'll be taking my chances on ANYTHING else . . . not Roxio
The Key to My Heart lipgloss chain is a very cute, original idea, but it fails to deliver the quality worthy of the Hard Candy name. The reviews here have all stated that this is a cute keychain, that the gloss is nice and that the colors are pretty. All very true. I got my keychain in the Pixie tones and they're girly and pretty and I was feeling pretty cool about it. However, for me, the disenchantment came with the mechanics of it.  ---  --- Now, I've always been a fairly careful person, I'm not klutzy nor do I drop or lose things. My keys are as normal as a standard set of keys can be, I never dropped them or banged them against stuff any more that's normal and yet, after less than a week the keychain hinges had broken twice. The first time I was able to make a little mess of superglue and scotch tape and managed to rescue it and put it back into almost normal condition, the second time however, I only noticed that the entire thing had fallen completely apart because I saw only half of the keychain remained and my keys were all covered in pink goo.  ---  --- How did it come apart like this? I honestly have no idea as my keys had only made the very normal trajectory between the ignition and my purse. I can honestly only chalk it up to really, really shoddy craftsmanship which may be adequate for a dresser-top lipgloss but never for something that could get even remotely more movement than that. It was a good idea but too low-quality to be fit for the purpose of a keychain. This is not the way to go for gloss on your keys
Great, fun product. My baby boy plays in it for up to 30 min. couple times a day. We own it from 2 months, he was 4 months old, he simply loves it. He jumps and plays with the toys. Absolutely the best buy
My friend from HK just got this phone and ask me to buy her an Eforcity screen protector.  She loves it!!
i bought my monitor yesterday and found to have a buzzing sound at lower brightness (<100%). just scheduled an exchange LCD
There are no instructins of anykind or anything with this item, and it says it is also a 5 gig mp3 player, well it comes with no software or anything else. If all u want is speakers to plug in its your bag if u want more forget i
Not so many words to talk about this item, but let me tell you that now I always use my rino turned on, in my car. baterie drain its no more cash pain! ---  --- **Good things: --- -comes with a led(small light) that turns on with diferent colors(red green yellow) so you could know if your rino its turned on or of or disconected. --- -large cable(for a car, you could use youre rino in the back seat even conected in the front of the car) ---  --- **bad things --- just a bad ending quality, it looks like a adapter of 2.99bucks, but I had owned it for more than a year and cero problems. ---  --- pvpaco@gmail.co
This is a piece of junk. The radio reception is terrible. FM is marginal and AM is almost nonexistent.
If you don't use this phone, it costs $3/month.  Normal hours til 9 p.m. it's 12 cents per minute, which is a bit less than half of what most prepaid phones cost.  Perfect for my occasional use and for locating family members when I'm in transit and feel that I simply must know where they are and what they are doing.  I don't use cell phones much, but if I must have one, I might as well have one that doesn't make me worry about another huge bill.  For kids who think they can mangle the budget, forget it cuz when the card is used up -- that's it kiddo.  Once they use up the card, the only number they can dial is 911, but that's it.  Bonus features: clock is always accurate and it has a great alarm which tells me when to get up to go to work and another to tell me when to go home at the end of the day.  At some point, I might not be able to live without this. 
My son has had this pogo stick for about a year and has not been able to play on it because the spring is too stiff and does not compress easily.  Even my daughter who weighs 70 lbs cannot get it to work.  Our 11 year old neighbour who has her own pogo stick had no problems, but it is not for the beginner
The brushes and everything else are super tiny, only a child's hand can hold those. Not a good set at all. Rather just go to micheal's art store and get the sumi set there. Just stay away from this set, unless you you buy this as a gift for your 3 years old child
Five stars may be excessive if you judge this CD alongside the greatest classics, but when compared to similar CDs within the singer-songwriter folk-rock genre, this beautifully simple and powerful collection really shines.  I find myself coming back to this CD more often than to many better-known classics because it has a freshness and originality that sustain interest.  The writing, while occasionally a bit awkward, is consistently interesting, honest and moving.  The themes of introspection, nostalgia,  regret, and defiance are presented in a searingly personal manner.  The song "If I Were a Man" is a rich celeration of the wonders women bring to relationships and the world; "Child of Steel" plucks the heartstrings with an achingly wistful delicacy; and "Take my Body" is a strong lament about the objectification of women.  I especially love the pared-down guitar arrangements; the simplicity really works with Ms. Cash's strong vocals and makes me wish some of my other favorite vocalists would occasionally just get back to basic guitar accompaniments.  I've seen Ms. Cash perform live and, while she has other hits that may be more popular, this collection reveals her unique brilliance
I subscibe to this magazine.  Will not renew it either!  Maybe I am too old to appreciate this periodical.  It is way overpriced even with the Amazom, and others discount
These wrestling shoes are an awesome buy for a great price. And they were delivered faster than expected
 Time to pack up my luggage (wouldn't it be nice to have a suitcase like Rincewind's?) and take off for Discworld while the rain and gloom of a January thaw engulf the northern hemisphere.  "Guards!  Guards!" is the eighth book in the Discworld series, in which Captain Sam Vimes of Ankh-Morpork's Night Watch gives up drinking and gets married (just the opposite of most folks).  I don't read the Discworld novels in order any more, just pick up a favorite and start in. ---  --- The blurbs on the back and cover pages compare Pratchett to Charles Dickens (Pratchett is better), Chaucer, "J.R.R. Tolkien with a sharper, more satiric edge," and P.G. Wodehouse.  I think any author who garners comparisons with such wildly disparate writers must be in a category by himself.  Heck, Pratchett IS a category by himself. ---  --- So on to Ankh-Morpork where the Unique and Supreme Lodge of the Elucidated Brethren decides, with a little prompting from its Supreme Grand Master, to conjure up a dragon.  The dragon will cause enough death and property damage (including a vegetable stand and a brother-in-law's shiny new carriage) so that when the Supreme Grand Master's nephew rides into the city with his sharp, shiny sword and slays the beast, the grateful citizens will proclaim him king. ---  --- This plot works rather well, except that the dragon decides that it wants to be king and cremates its would-be slayer.  Its requirements are simple and traditional:  one well-bred virgin per month, and all of the gold, silver, and jewels in Ankh-Morpork for its hoard.  ---  --- The new regime fires Sam Vimes from his job as captain of the Night Watch.  How he wonders, could things get worse? ---  --- Well, at least he's not a virgin and no one is talking to him in capital letters.
I used Lexar Media Multi Card REader in my P2120 Fujitsu laptop via a USB 2 PC-Card adapter.  It's truly plug-and-play without any need of drivers in Windows XP
This is a fantastic movie! The acting is superb, and it keeps you guessing until the end. Nicole Kidman deserved her Oscar
I was very disappointed in this product.   It is for a child and yet the wood string holder was not even attached to the guitar.  This product lasted a whole two days before the part fell off and you could no longer use the guitar.   The tuners also were unable to tighten so you basically had a piece of useless wood shaped like a guitar.
These undies look very cute, but they don't breathe and, well, let's just say that wicking moisture away rather than trapping it is what one should expect in underwear
Sadly, as a rule, I have no great interest in history.  But Ms. Behrman's approach brings the person of Thomas Jefferson to life in a way that appeals to all ages.  She puts personality and emotion into her writing which makes potentially dull facts, dates and events brim with energy.  This is a wonderful series and she does it justice in every way
when i first saw the game for number 5 on top games. I new i wanted it. My littlwe bro like eww that game is horrible. I ask my grandma 2 buy it for me and it so fun. I lov it if u like games that r easy than play this on
JUST WANTED TO SHARE WITH YOU THAT I WAS SO HAPPY WITH MY CHRISTMAS CARDS. THEY WERE DELIVERED ON TIME. THEY WERE BEAUTIFUL AND UNIQUE!
Yum...play food! This is a great set. I will buy it as soon as I find it. This is a great set! Lots of cans (good for storage), ice cream, boxed treats, cookies, (yummy), and of course, much more. And who could resist the spaghetti with meatballs? And is that chocolate chips on the ice cream? Oh my gosh, it's better than I thought. --- You might think that to have a good time, your child needs 40 dollar Melissa and Doug wooden play food with real cutting noises and a Fisher Price 100 dollar kitchen for imaginative play. Bullpies, I say. I have tons of dollar-store food. I have ultra-realistic foam food from a kitchen set I got. I prefer the dollar store food. Dollar store food is better because it has more in one package, looks real, is cheap, pretty durable, and looks nice. I have a really silly play food set that came with a stovetop (small, but the knobs turn!), a pink and purple propane tank, a can of "barracuda" (seriously), and a can of "barracuda hash" which included barracuda, ham and eggs, chicken, turkey, potpie, and more eggs. But the logo has spam and a hotdog, and the front of it has beans, turkey, fish, sausage, and lots of weird meat. But it says "Eatable, 100% dainty, Present!, Daintiness, Dainty". Just wanted to let you know.  --- So, bottom line is, dollar store play food is much better than you think it is. It comes with lots of things that the expensive companies would never have dreamed of
I absolutely love this eyeshadow. I have it in three different colors, as after my first one (the Illuminateur), I got addicted. I've since bought the Ambre and the Bleu Swimming Pool. It can be hard to tell from pictures on this site, or any other, what the color of this item is really like. That is it say, it changes depending on the light. My white Illuminateur looks purple in some lights, shiny white in others, and a light blue in others. It's really amazing on its own, or layered. All of the colors have a lot of "oomph" to them. Make sure you shake the bottle before using for best color results (as mentioned on the packaging). ---  --- As someone who doesn't own a lot of makeup brushes, I love that it includes one. However, I have noticed with these, and with other brands of eyeshadow that have similar packaging, if you're not careful, you can bend some of the bristles backwards (and they may stay that way) when reinserting the brush. Simply solved by not rushing. :
I got this and the RangeBooster is a lie. It has NOT boosted any kind of range on my network. It also goes in and out of service often. I wasted my money on this one
There was no indication prior to purchase that the ramp would need to be secured to another surface thru nails or bolts. My son saved up to buy this thinking he could use it on a sidewalk or road. He could not. It is too light to maintain any stability without being fastened to another surface
It doesn't get any better than this. This album is a must have for all true Judas Priest fans. This is Priest when they were really getting good. The guitars and the vocals rock you to the core
I first saw these speakers at the Apple store, and i really liked the sound and the look.  I went on amazon and found a better price and i couldnt be happier with them.  As long as you have a decent soundcard, these speakers really are great.  i have had no problem with them at all, they look really cool, they're loud, they're small, the woofer gives you a lot of bass (which you can turn down), and the sound from the speakers is clear.  buy these
Color shown as natural is far from accurate. I am unhappy with color and may return these
You won't go wrong with a Panasonic DV. I've had a few models. I have several of this model for my business. They're rock solid reliable, nice and small for portability, and the quality of the recording is very goo
Coat was of VERY cheap quality. The fur around hood was matted. No way I would wear or recommend this coat.  It went staight to Good Will. I guess you get what you pay for.  Unless it is free you are paying too much
pretty decent utilitarian paddle.  i think this is a better deal than all the other low end paddles out there, since shipping cost was zero
This episode of Star Trek, "The Man Trap" is my earliest memory of what would become a lifelong enjoyment of the franchise. Truthfully, "The Man Trap" terrified me (I was maybe two, or three, although I am sure by that time the series was limping along in it's third season and I was seeing a repeat for the first time); Star Trek was considered "adult programming", and as such I was not allowed to watch it - I used to sneak behind the couch while my grandfather watched it on nights I stayed at their house, then would lay awake in my bed scared by what I'd seen, but excited just the same. Like another space show I enjoyed and was terrified by (Lost in Space), I didn't recognize Star Trek as anything but a world I wanted very much to be in, but remained frightened of anyhow (I was, as I said, very young). 
This might work fine if you use a bike rack to transport your bike...but I laid it in the back of my pickup and it snapped. Not very durable
This skate was purchased for 6 year old granddaughter and given as a "Santa" gift...the hit of the day!  Although she hasn't had much opportunity to use them yet, she did try them out one evening at an indoor rink and they seemed to work just fine.  They are nice looking and fit is true to size
Man, there's no way to describe this movie. ---  --- Slow, boring, unidimensional, bad plot, really bad acting... --- Really low-budget (in a bad way) ---  --- I'm not gonna get my time or my money back. I bought it based on the reviews, and they were really off... Even if you enjoy the gothic ambience, believe me, it's really bad. ---  ---  --- You've been warned
This is the ultimate magazine for mystery readers and mystery writers. From front cover to back, it's full of the information you need to know about new books, favorite authors, and what's going on in the mystery business
Apart from the great selection of soundtracks, what really makes this compilation top value is the quality of the sound processing. Executed with finesse, these tracks sound better than when first issued and many are unedited, fuller versions: like "Singing In The Rain", for example. Throw in the great price, and this double disc set is a "must have" for all lovers of classic movie music
I have an Amazon bookmark that advertises Ludlum's book "The Sigma Protocol". It says "In Ludlum's latest, an ordinary man battles a global conspiracy." Well gee. That's the plot of THIS book as well. Come to think of it, that's the plot of every book by the man that I've read. A 'vast right wing conspiracy' is set to take over the world. They have small armies, a lot of money and a plan. This time around, a group of military men (naturally) plan to foment terror, and use the chaos to implement their vision of the world (laugh not - millions in the Middle East and far Left believe 9-11 was something along the same lines). Enter "ordinary man" Joel Converse. He's a Vietnam vet and P.O,W. who thought he had left that life far behind. It's up to him to save the world. He will survive certain death several times (the bad guys always seem to think they need him alive, and they just HAVE to explain their conspiracy to this total stranger). He will find love, and he'll visit several European cities to boot. Of course, a suspension of disbelief is essential for many novels (how else would you believe that a Nazi and an Israeli are on the same side?), but Ludlum's cliched stories are further worsened by the fact that he just couldn't write. His dialogue writing is always tedious, and sometimes just painful to read. Action scenes are generic. The only thing he could do right is character background, but that's not enough to save this. "The Aquitaine Progression" might make a half decent TV movie, but to endure 700 pages is just too much
while there are many benefits to learning vocabulary with this tool, I found it did not help with conversation.
I am not sure why the author thought he had something to offer on this subject.  There was no original thought or useful lessons on the topic that was promised by the title.  I read this book because it was the subject of an on-line book club for public health leaders but will be much more discriminating in the future regarding the purchase of books that are recommended by this group.
Skechers just seem to fit my feet well. Lucky me. These were inexpensive, solidly constructed, comfortable, and (at least in my eyes) stylish. What more could I ask for in a casual shoe
I hate lawyers. ---  --- What is a lawyer, anyway? Basically: it's a telemarketer in a decent suit, a guy who would be hawking the latest Ronco Hair-in-a-Can super-duper late night special to folks in Akron over his plantronic headset, only he won the genetic lottery and got shot out of an upper-middle class womb.  ---  --- Shakespeare said it first and best: "First, let's kill all the lawyers!". Former Enron uber-dealmaker John Wing put a little fast-times Houston spin on that one: "get all the lawyers in a room---and shoot 'em!---in the mouth, so you *can't* miss!"  ---  --- Exactly. Anyway, "The Firm" is a flick that purports to make the world of high-priced yappers jaw-rippingly exciting, so I was probably all amped up to despise it.  ---  --- But not really: back before I dug into a gig with the Dark Side in high finance, back when I was hefting a backpack over the sodden campus of my old alma mater, I briefly considered going into law: briefly, for about an hour. It was a desperate time, and I needed money.  ---  --- Why did I consider walking Hell's Highway, if only for an instant? Because John Grisham, boring lawyer-turned-ripping-potboiler-writer-turned-back-into-boring-lawyer, a kind of Tom Clancy for the paper-pusher and green-eyeshade set, made it all sound pretty damned funky (and lucrative! Hey, dig that BMW 7 series, baby, beep beep!) in his engrossing little novel "The Firm": granted, I've read better prose on the backs of cereal boxes, but it held my attention.  ---  --- I mean, seriously: you're 19, and the whole flying out on the corporate Lear to Grand Cayman and switching out briefcases full of cash sounds kinda cool. And strippers, man, plenty of strippers. Oh, and did someone mention a BMW? ---  --- What's the difference between a lawyer and a snake? The snake at least has the decency to hiss before it sinks its fangs into your a**.  ---  --- Now it's true: Grisham writes like Kim Jong Il sings, but---in "The Firm", anyway---he was a master craftsman at moving things along at a bristling pace, from the pedestrian---hotshot Law School whiz kid gets picked up by a Memphis white-shoe law firm---to the Pretty Damned Atrocious, all while keeping the pressure ratcheted up with a dense, suffocating sense of malice.  ---  --- Grisham, like Michael Crichton, isn't a prose genius: he's not even mediocre. But he writes for film, and "The Firm" cried out for cinematic treatment.  ---  --- So it's baffling that, with all the right Stuff---Tom Cruise as winsome lead Mitch McDeere, Gene Hackman doing his chain-drinking Gene Hackman thang as the corrupt (but ultimately worn-out and pathetic) senior partner, and Sydney Pollack helming it up---that the big-screen treatment of "The Firm" is such a yawner.  ---  --- Talk about contempt of court. ---  --- Pollack takes all that intricately woven little Grisham-plot and barfs big ugly chunks of it up on the screen. At its guts, really, "The Firm" was really nothing more than the Big Career Nightmare: I've bet the farm on this gig, I'm getting big money, I'm working like a fiend, my wife is having trouble remembering my name, and evidently I'm not doing tax-deals for loaded clients---I'm doing money laundering for The Mob.  ---  --- Pollack just mangles the whole thing, convolutes the simple, and renders up a flick that will have you checking your watch and yawning. Casting is part of the problem: Cruise does his thing, running around Memphis with his briefcase. Hackman drinks a lot and exudes pure Armani-clad sleaze: "The Firm" is all funny-wrinkles when he's onscreen, but hey, a man can only do so much.  ---  --- Jeanne Tripplehorn (Cruise's squeeze), who plays Lara San Giacomo when she's not playing Tripplehorn (seriously, google the two of 'em: astounding!) is a bitter old battleaxe who made me want to stick forks in my eyes. Wilford Brimley is just plain wrong as The Firm's security chief: too bald, too cracker, too rotund, too silly, too low-end, to do the role justice.  ---  --- Holly Hunter is even worse: Hunter is one of those eighties thangs who got pumped up as Something Sexy, which is baffling, given that she's about 3'8, and has all the sex appeal of an Oompah-Loompah. It doesn't help that she's a big, ugly Southern stereotype, the caricature most denizens of dumpy Michigan towns imagine Southerners to be. You want her to die: she doesn't. Pollack wants us to think she's clever and funny. She isn't.  ---  --- Ed Harris, I think, is in this movie. So is Hal Holbrook, which kinda ruins everything, because everytime Hal Holbrook is in a movie you know you're dealing with a bunch of friggin' crooks.   ---  --- Anyway, the coup de grace to the stupidity is the entrance, Deus Ex Machina, of Paul Sorvino (Don Morolto---what kind of Goombah name is dat, anyway? Somebody call Tony Soprano!), who takes this juggernaut of boredom from the merely stupid to the totally ridiculous.  ---  --- If you wanna see Tom Cruise running around Memphis with his briefcase for two hours, by all means belly up to the bar.  ---  --- Otherwise, case dismissed.  ---  --- JS
Super Chevy is a on top magazine they keep you well informed on helpful info for building hot engines & doing it with value in mind, they are also helpful with visual pictures in a step by step sequence with many hints that the average person can understand. I also like it when they show different parts & electrical pictures for building a car from start to finish the more information the better, this is true for transmissions & rear ends. Also like all the great hands on how to do it from people in the know, thanks!
I doubt that they are all this bad.  Maybe I just got "lucky".  The first time I put the tape in, the motor could hardly pull the tape.  When I tried to record, it played back all shaky, like a playing a record off-center on a turntable.  I returned it
Grand Theft Auto is now in 3rd person perspective! No more overhead camera. Well, at least it's not the only mode of view. That in itself makes this game great. You're an escaped convict that's trying to establish a name for himself and make some money by completing missions. The cities are virtually yours. Vast, easy to explore, no limitations. You can jump and hijack any car, beat a poor old lady with a baseball bat, even steal police cars. But don't go too trigger-happy, or else the feds will be all over you. --- You take on various missions and upon completing them you receive credits and advance onto more interesting and complicated ones. --- GTA3 is great fun to play. Good graphics, a lot of missions to complete, very many cars and weapons
I don't have the tin version but an earlier version.  The cards look different but the game is played the same.  I have been playing this with my now current 10 year old for 2 years and we both love it.  A little luck, some strategy, and a whole lot of fun.  Don't let the age levels fool  you-adults will enjoy this as well.  A classic that will never go out of style
Switch was simple to install to my existing network, just plug and go. I used this switch to separate some CPUs off of the 100mb network and put them on the gig highway. Worked just as planned and was seamless. I actually added two of these and saved big jack over a 16 port gig switch. Network speed and response time increased even for those CPUs w/out a gig nic. I like the idea of having a switch with capacity that far exceeds network traffic. Highly recommend
Incredible boot!  Comfort, style and warmth have proved their way with this boot.  I get positive comments each time I wear them!  The tread is perfect for walking in snow pack too.  You don't slide a bit.  I'll enjoy these for years
This replaced a similar wrist cuff meter which I was not happy with.  The old meter would give very different readings on measurements made minutes apart.  This meter yields essentially the same numbers for second measurements.  Out of curiosity, I took it with me to my doctors office, used his large cuff (I have very large arms) and compared the readings to his equipment.  Total difference was about 3%, a quite acceptable tolerance for my home measurement.  Another reviewer was unhappy with the screen size and position on the bottom of the wrist.  If the unit is operated as shown in the instructions, the screen size and position are perfect, the unit is at heart level, and is quite easy to read. ---  --- Overall, for home use and serious data collection and blood pressure monitoring, I like this device
I had my order within 48 hours! --- Product was great as well !!!!
Our grandson reciently came to live with us, nearly 2 years old and he refused to even sit on a potty.  --- The day  our 1st pott arrived I opened the package and set the potty up in our bathroom next to the adult version hopeing this location would help. ---  About 15 minutes later I noticed Drake had been very quiet.As I searched the house for him I discovered him not only sitting on the pot but he had actually used it ! He is now doing very well with his training ! ---  The product is well constructed, easy to to set up, and easy to use 
Coming from a listener with a broad scope of musical preferences, Blues has always been a multi-faceted genre which can be broken down into the categories:Soulful Blues, Drinking Blues and Guitar Blues. "B.B King - Live At The Regal" is one of those recordings that just happens to capture all three. ---  --- This recording is dear to my heart as I can remember far back as first or second grade when my grandmother (God Bless) used to play this on 8-track. She used to love herself some Riley "Blues Brother" King. This recording ALWAYS seemed to be in the player when my cousins and I would come over to visit and rest assured, You WILL hear it before you left to go home. ---  --- At that time, Being the young naive kid that I was, I remember saying that I hated it and that it was old folks music. All grown up now, In an age where real music is practically unheard of in terms of what these young artists of today release on CDs, I have a newfound respect for real stuff like this. So instead of sitting around burning your brain cells trying to understand what this new generation is calling itself creating, You have decided to come to one of the first sources for good old fasioned real music....The Blues. ---  --- In my opinion, "BB King Live At The Regal" is one of Mr. King's best recordings and with myself not being a big fan of live albums, This is one of those rare live pieces that captures the essence of what a live recording should sound like. Maybe not so much in terms of the musicianship but the overall performance of those involved. The arrangements were put together nicely & the musicians were all in a very tight vibe on this album and whoever was on the mixing board did an excellent job of capturing this essence. BB's pickin' and crooning mixed with the superb playing by the band make this a wonderful place to start for the blues or BB King enthusiast.  ---  --- It sounds as if it was made in a tasteful nightclub full of grown people who wanted to hear good music while having a good time. The ladies were screaming and the gentlemen were cheering and BB was playing at his best. The only gripe I have about this disc is that it is very short; which was typical considering the age and time that it was made but still essential and a solid lesson for anyone interested in Blues (especially Blues Guitar). I recommend getting this and BB's "Live In Cook County Jail". They both are live albums and both have some of the same songs on them but they were done in a different way and should still be heard. ---  --- Good choice if you get this one.  
Crashes on every thing I try to do. I've never seen such a poor excuse for a program. I paid 70 dollars for it and am now throwing it in the TRASH.
First of all, let me say this product is great in almost every way. So if you need to feel better about your nose and/or throat, go for it. ---  --- My main complain about the Grossan Hydro Pulse is that it is noticeably expensive. Some time ago, Grossan was making just his own irrigator tip matching it to a Waterpik machine that cost a half the price of the Hydro Pulse. But then, Grossan decided to produce his own machine and, if I'm right, Viajet is making it for him. Viajet sells the same machine, except for the Grossan tip, at about -again- a half the price of the Hydro Pulse.  The Breathe-ease solution that you might use along with the irrigator is also expensive (I have check this comparing it with a simillar product that can be purchased in my country). ---  --- So what makes the Hydro Pulse so expensive? Maybe health is a business, after all. ---  --- Other than that, like I have said, this product is great for almost any respiratory problem. I used to irrigate my nose with a similar solution that comes in a 135 ml bottle, and is intended to use it over 50 times. The Hydro Pulse lets you do a 500 ml clean everytime, so you get the idea. ---  --- Also, if you are suffering respiratory problems and want to chek an interesting drug-free treatment, look for the Buteyko Method
We have a new Keurig coffee maker and just love Timothy's coffees, any flavor, but especially the German Chocolate.  Great price too
When i got my gummi bears, they were kinda stuck together and kinda hard. but it's still good.
Get great information on most bridal manufacturers as well as great ways to save money, such as Discount Bridal Service. I found my dream dress at a huge discount and was very pleased with the service. A good book for  brides
It is an acquired taste. When a friend offered me a piece I said sure and soon made a face she still laughs about. But it was an interesting sensation that was happening in my mouth. Salty, then sweet, then hot. I had to finish the piece even though I didn't care for it initially, because it was fascinating. ---  --- Then I decided to try another piece I was offered at a Mexican restaurant. I found that it tasted better to me and was still very interesting sensation. Now I bought a package of 4 pcs each time a special event in culinary weirdness and now I am a pulparindo addict. What came to mind was a scene in Star Trek the Next Generation when Data just got his new emotion chip and drank a nasty concoction. Guinan says,"How do you like it?' Data says, "It's revolting. May I have a another?
Why endure the months wait. Get it from the source for the same price and you'll get a sample issue before you have top commit to a subscriptio
This is in my opinion by far the best Earl Grey Tea in the Market. Loose tea is significantly better in taste than the tea bags from the same manufacturer. The 6 pack is a great deal
this movie is nothing special, it's not super awesome but it's still good.  i'm the triple shot gun thing is awesome and it's fairly gory.  if you're into dead alive, cannibal holocaust, the return of the living dead movies, and just cheap funny/gory zombie movies i recomend this movie
  I love it!!! , u have all that u need for helth care baby here , just in one pack !!! u dont need to buy more ..
Jonny's conversion is fine and I hope he is happy, but this album was not good if you are expecting the blues guitar work of his early albums.  If you want christan rock maybe this could be for you, but he missed the mark with me big time
As much as it pains me to say it this live cd is not a worthy billy joel release. In fact one wonders why it was released at all. Billy's voice is strained and is prone to over singing and the arrangements are overblown. From the sound of things Billy sounds like he was drunk or on medication. A lot of the running time is waisted with lengthy monologues with the audience. Why this was put on the CD is anyones guess but it just neans less songs!  ---  --- However the good news is that this CD has now been blown away by his superb new 12 Gardens CD in which Billy is the Billy of old. The one who sung well and sung the songs straight as they were meant to be sung. 12 Gardens is crammed with 32 songs rather than the 26 on offer here and there's no timewaisting audience chat!!
Within a couple days after installing Dragon, it showed a high degree of accuracy. The accuracy depends on how late at night you dictate.  It was installed on a 2.7 Celeron with 512 of memory.  The program generally keeps up quite well. The program works with Comcast and AOL free ride but seem to have a lot of glitches with aol.com
I was very excited to get this game.  I did read previously written reviews. My 13 yr old daughter wants to become a veterinarian someday and loves spending time on the computer, so this just seemed like the perfect Christmas gift.  Alas, the game has many faults that does interfere with the game being enjoyable!  I should have listened to the reviews..... ---  --- The game is extremely glichy!  It makes playing it very hard and frustrating.  My daughter tried for one week and has given up.  The characters get stuck and just stand and vibrate on the screen until you start the game over.  Sometimes she will play for a half hour before it starts up and sometimes it does this right away.  VERY DISAPPOINTING.   ---  --- Also, some internal setup issues of the actual CD is that it works better running from the disk then saving it to the computers hard drive.  We have a pretty new computer, we have windows XP - this program just doesn't run well off our computer anyway.  We have other games that don't have this problem. In fact my son got a game - building machines and inventions - and it doesn't have any of these problems and actually requires more from my hard drive. ---  --- Also, my daughter complains of some of the limitations within pet vet that don't allow her to change.  You have to pay a specified amount to hire an employee and the employee in this game is a slouch - there are no other choices when hiring staff, no wage choices, you can't get this employee to work or and you cannot hire anyone else.   ---  --- Overall because of the gliches in the game, she hasn't been able to play it to the programs full potential and has given up....so the idea is great.. but the makers should have looked at this better before taking the consumers money and putting it on the market.  I cannot find any fixes or downloads online to repair it either.  BIG BUMMER!!!  BEWARE!  JUST DON'T BUY THIS ONE, LOOK ELSEWHERE
I got this as a gift last christmas and I loved it. The scent is very nice and actually lasts. I give britney credit for this one. I need to replace it already thats how much ive used it its almost gone. I recommend this one.
I understand why the Beatles are the top sellers in rock music as they suck. They only made about two decent songs in their "Hey Jude" a pretty song, and "Ballad Of John And Yoko". The sixties was a horrible decade of rock music. I would have to be said that only very few good songs came out in the sixties, which one of them is Neil Young's "Down By The River". --- I have listened to the Beatles for about a month and thought how lame and pathetic their music was. They were hugely one of the most overrated bands of all time. This ONE album is definately not the album to buy at ALL unless you are a sick moron who does not have a good taste in music. --- Here you will get 25 of the worst songs ever recorded. If you want good music, I recommend go buy albums from Foreigner, Dire Straits, Green Day, Guns N' Roses, and Metallica insted. Don't buy this album at most costs as you will waste money on 25 awful songs
I bought this pump because it had the medela name and I thought it was reliable. I was wrong. This is the worst pump in the world. Everything the other poster said is true. This is the worst breastpump. I would NOT recommend this breastpump to anyone
I bought this game for my mom for christmas and we played it...right now it is in my game closet because I introduced this game to my poker friends and now we have "PIT" night instead of poker night. We can not stop laughing when we play this game. We bring this to all get-togethers and everyone loves it.I had to buy my mom a new PIT game because I take it all the time. This game is soooo much fun, the more people you play with the more fun it is!!! GET THIS GAME!!
This is an elegant leather case for the Canon elph cameras. It fits in the pocket easily. I'm satisfied
it is a little costy but worth the money. it washes and dries perfectly also with hot water and blanket can be used in many ways. since we have tiles in our whole appartment i love to keep the blanket on a little carpet for extra warmth and cleanliness.a perfect place to play on when they are little and also to take along since it is very light weight.  ---  once baby is older it can be used as a sleeping blanket or as a bed cover. its size is large enough to last many years.  --- 
We got this chair as a baby shower gift, which I registered for and absolutely love it!  I don't understand the problems the other reviewers are talking about.  If used properly, this chair gives absolutely no problems.  The seat locks in at different levels, if it's not locked in, of course it will fall apart.   ---  --- The seat is easy to use, folds easily, and cleans easily.  We store it in our van (we have Stow-and-go storage) and it fits perfectly! ---  --- We've used it since my son, now 16 months, could sit up.  He lays his body from side to side and the seat doesn't budge...very safe.  The tray does snap off easily, and he has done that at times while trying to climb up on it.  This doesn't bother me, since it's not a 'toy' and shouldn't be climbed on anyway.  The tray hasn't snapped off while in use, and hopefully won't!   ---  --- We've used this chair on both a chair, and the floor when seating was limited (like at family get togethers).  We haven't had any problems at all. ---  --- Anyway, I highly recommend it..
I saw this movie about two weeks ago and I can't believe how disappointed I am for this. I was expecting fireworks; instead I got a truckload of bad karma on my head. Not only that but it maybe the most over-the-top film I ever saw and it will be on my list of the worst movies I ever saw. To begin with half of the characters die in this film and I was like 'What is the meaning?' then there's the film's signature moment in which Sinatra wakes up from his nightmare and they do it in such a matter that they put his face right at the camera. Again I said to myself, 'What's the point?' And then there's the chilling climax which would be totally ripped off a year later by the Kennedy assassination-from the scoped rifle right down to James Gregory's character getting shot in the head. In one of the documentries to this DVD director William Fredkin says that there is no doubt this movie caused Lee Harvey Oswald to kill President Kennedy because 'Oswald realized that he was Raymond Shaw.' If he's right that raises the question: Did he do it by his beliefs or did someone push him over? Then Fredkin ends his obseravation by saying that the release of "The Manchurian Candidate" and the death of President Kennedy are the two events that made the 1960's what it is and why people today (including me) are still obessed with that decade. In conclusion, I think this was a big disappoinment. And this movie is on the list of AFI's 100 greatest films? Please.
These are great! Very smooth and yummy.  The only thing is I think they are a little to sweet for me.  I just add a little more coffee and a tad of milk, then they're perfect! --- I'll buy them again for sure
Ah, these Godiva pieces of chocolate are incredible. They are crunchy and incredibly delicious. Whenever I have to make a lasting impression I buy Godiva and the lady is always thrilled. This brand is the very best when it comes to chocolate and this gift box is one of their best.
This book covers everything you'll need to know about making model scenery. That being said, the material presented may seem a little overwhelming and difficult to a novice, however, with some trial and error, you'll eventually get it righ
I love toeless hosiery, but these are the most uncomfortable pantyhose I have ever worn.  If I'm sitting down at all the backs of my thighs start to itch so horribly, and it gets worse when I stand.  These are awful, I can't stand it.  The only good things I can say are unlike some toeless pantyhose I have worn in the past, the toe thong does not bind, and the lightest color actually is light enough for my skin tone, but it is so not worth the itching.  Also, they run rather large, the material doesn't have nearly enough stretch and they bag around the ankles and knees.  I'm only 5 feet tall but out over 120 lbs. and the smallest size is still too big.  I'll give Hue's a try and I might even spring for the Donna Karan toeless panythose, but I won't get these ones again
This book is unfortunately not up to par for Kay Hooper.  Her normal suspense is missing and you would have to be psychic to know who the murderer is (there isn't a single clue at any point in time).  The heroine keeps loosing her memory, so you don't even have the usual good characterizations of hero & heroine (since she can't even remember much about herself, much less him).  If you like Kay go ahead and read it, but I hope the next one is back up to her usual high standard
I borrowed this pump from a Mom who just used it the 8 weeks she was out of work.  I used it FREQUENTLY (at least twice daily) for the 5 months I pumped at work.  It always worked wonderfully.  I never had trouble with let-down or supply.  Sometimes I filled both 8 oz. bottles in a 15-minute session!  Unless you have problems with breastfeeding or milk supply, I can't imagine this pump not working great.  I didn't have any problems with it the whole time I used it
I ordered one, but would like to know if on the last review if that is salt water or fresh and what kind of luck, and on the other update on further finds, as for the other review just find Google and type in Bounty Hunter and the name of the detector and you'll find all of that then knock it down to the best buy and or support which ever is important to you, I bought a detector when I was 13 by picking strawberries all summer I am 30+ years past that and I had a blast until I sat on it :< , I want that fun back! I know im kinda turning this into a Blog but its important for things left unsaid and more helpful for those checking it out for the first time
All I wanted was a bottle that I could use to mix y protein but this stupid things leaks every time because the lid doesnt fit right. You'd think something with only ONE purspoe would adequately fill that role.... well in this case it doesn't
its a great price but its VERY small. Its unfortunate because it seems well made and folds up nicely but its way too small. There's no way 4 kids can comfortable sit at it.
I unpacked this warmer which we received as a gift - did not use one with our first child.  I got as far as filling the removable reservoir with water before I decided to return it.  You literally fill a plastic reservoir with water and turn it upside down so that the lid to the reservoir, which slides on, has no rubber seal or other watertight implements, can leak everywhere.  Judging by the other comments, I'm glad it leaked before I had a chance to use it and burn up a box of wipes.
I've owned a Tracfone for 3 years.  My old Tracfone quit working, so I purchased a new one.  I've been trying for 4 weeks to transfer my old phone number to my new Tracfone.  It's been a nightmare-after 4 weeks, 3 new sim cards, and countless calls to TracFone customer service reps, I've accomplished nothing.  My phone is still not activated, I still don't have my old number transfered, and I've wasted 7 hours speaking to customer reps.  I don't recommend TracFone
Clint Eastwood's "The Eiger Sanction" was made in 1975 and was, at that time, an excellent action thriller. Viewing it again recently, I was surprised at how well it has held up. This is due mostly to the location shoots - filmed in Monument Valley and in the Swiss Alps instead of on a Hollywood soundstage. These guys really went up there and filmed those climbing sequences for real (including star and director Eastwood, who was about 45 at the time), and that just can't be faked. The spy story is also pretty good, there is an excellent supporting performance by Jack Cassidy, and Vonetta McGee and George Kennedy lend solid support. Also, John Williams' pre-Star Wars score is hauntingly jazzy and suspenseful. Check this one out
"I have been a Brickman fan since the very first album. Much of his early songs were uplifting piano solos without much "electronic enhancement." Escape is a wonderful album full of songs you might find on his early albums. There are three excellent vocals on the CD that will please fans who favor his more recent work which tends to feature the vocalist over the piano.  ---  --- If you are a Brickman fan, this is a must have album.
I've owned 2 sets of these types of phone systems.  A GE set and a 2.4 gig Uniden set.   ---  --- This is by far the best.  Actually, it's perfect.  No noise on the line at all.  Everything just works perfectly. ---  --- Only one caution. This particular model does not have an answering machine.  I was moving too fast when i bought and thought that it did.  If you want an answering machine to come with, make sure you buy the right model.   ---  --- I'm totally sold on the DECT 6.0!!!! ---  --- Buy it.  You won't regret it.   --- 
Rent a hospital grade Medalia pump.  You wont be sorr
I have used this matcha daily for about 6 weeks now. It is very good for what I use it for. I make my own version of Starbucks Green Tea Frappuccino. (Once that drink name started to roll of my kids' tongues easily - I realized I was spending too much money on these drinks - and daily!)I am not familiar with various grades of matcha, but did not want something pre-sweetened or modified because I wanted to control the sugar, etc. I make my frappuccino like this: sorry - I do not measure - so you may have to modify these amounts because I am guessing! ---  --- 1 1/2c milk --- 2 heaping spoonfuls (the spoon that's included) green tea powder --- 1/8c simple syrup (I make it myself and keep in fridge for week or so) --- 10+ice cubes (adjust to your taste - depends on size of cubes) ---  --- Blend this in a blender - longer than you think - pulse first then blend for a bit - I scrape down a bit bc the powder flies around a little and you don't want to lose any. (Simple syrup is 1c water, 1c sugar heated until sugar dissolves) It is much easier than it may sound - I make these daily in the morning. I hope this helps anyone else out there who is addicted to the GT Frappuccino - it is slightly different (I think they use a different gt powder and a honeydew syrup), but I liked mine MORE within the first week of having them! --- 
Belt clip is sturdy.  Velcro is velcro (it's solid, but the separation noise can be annoying when you're trying to get to your phone in a quiet setting).  Love the flexability of the side connectors, allowing quick access to the phone.  Comfortable and fairly low profile. ---  --- I have a Samsung D807
I buy these shoes in bulk as they are so good.  I have high arches and these shoes are the only ones that have never given me any trouble.  I am now on my 3rd pair and use them for my marathon training and running
"The Writer" is the premier magazine for writers of all varieties. Kalmbach is known for publishing a great series of specialty periodicals, and this one is extremely well written and edited, as is appropriate for the subject matter. ---  --- The magazine is best for aspiring writers of fiction, with the clear majority of column inches. Poetry is also covered well, and nonfiction (my area of interest), while covered, is definitely in third place. In the end, though, most techniques for fiction also help nonfiction authors and vice-versa: I read every issue cover to cover regardless of area of concentration because I have gleaned some of the best tips from articles that superficially seemed not to pertain to my writing.  ---  --- The magazine is very good at covering new developments in the publishing world, and features in-depth reporting on subjects like "Print on Demand" (POD) publishing. Many articles concentrate on in-depth technique implementation, while the utilitarian short pieces that cut through grammatical tedium and stylistic methodologies reinforce the basics.  ---  --- If you are interested in writing as a professional or just for personal satisfaction, "The Writer" is the magazine for you.
Set up was easy. Just read the manual and follow the instructions. Don't take short cuts. ---  --- Forcasting is excellent after setting the barometer to match local conditions. We live over 1,000 feet above sea level. Adjusting for that was needed. Weather.com's zip code oriented barometric pressure info made that relatively easy. ---  --- The screen is easy to read and understand. The main unit has a solid feel and does not look cheap. ---  --- The external humidity and temperature sensor fits easily between a closed window and it's screen. ---  --- The manual could be more complete. It wasn't clear that the icon that depicts a connection with the national time service doesn't appear until after the first connection is made in the wee hours of the morning. When you manually set the clock make sure you do it in 24 hour mode. Then, switch to 12 hour mode if that is what you want displayed. Again, the manual should have pointed that out
The Good --- -------- --- * This is a nice magazine for the price.  --- * It has some informative articles, which maybe useful to newcomers to photography in general or the digital aspects of photography.  --- * If you are getting started in photography, or you are at a beginner/amateur level, this magazine can be very helpful as a stepping stone --- * If you are an experienced amateur/pro, you can still like this magazine, but don't expect many in-depth/advanced topics. --- * The Monthly Lens reviews are helpful to SLR/DSLR users --- * For people who like to flip through magazines and even look at ads from different vendors, this is a good resource. ---  ---  --- The Not so good --- --------------- --- * The technical reviews of digital cameras are skin-deep compared to the in-depth technical reviews by the online photography sites (such as dpreview).  --- * Sometimes the reviews are word-smithed in such a way that they avoid saying negative things, so -at times- you have to pick-up on what is not said in the review in order to figure out if there's something wrong with a product. --- * The "News" are 4-12 weeks behind real time.  --- * If you expect in-depth or pro-level articles, those are rare. ---  ---  --- Consumer beware segment --- ----------------------- --- Towards the back of the magazine there are plenty of ads from various mail-order vendors. Some of them are very reputable, honorable and reliable vendors such as B&H and J&R.  ---  --- However, some other vendors are less than stellar - to put it in mildly. You will recognize them by the too-good-to-be-true super-low prices, and they usually practice "bait & switch" among other things. These have been documented on various websites and photography forums. If you are not familiar with all these, and you see prices that are very low, you may want to do some research before purchasing
There are issues regarding hardware incompatibility w/ specific components of the Toshiba Satellite M45-S355. The hardware incompatibility issues w/ the DVD-RAM drive, the GL910 chipset, and the SoundMax integrated audio drivers are known to both Microsoft Technical Service personnel and their counterparts at Toshiba. I spent an hour of fruitless time on a conference call with technicians from both companies (both of whom spoke what could loosely be descibed as "English"). The Amazon representative with whom I spoke was in New Delhi. I ultimately figured out (on my own) which Toshiba drivers needed to be downloaded (again consuming hours of download time with a 56K modem), and I used an Iomega CD-Rom USB external drive to load the software after about six extremely aggravating hours. I was able to avoid similar pitfalls when attempting to install Small Business Accounting 2006. Don't buy these products unless you absolutely MUST. Microsoft's "technical service" is a euphemism more aptly meaning "technically useless". There is nothing technically professional about the additional capabilities of Microsoft XP Professional. I should also mention that both the Toshiba laptop and the software were purchased from Amazon
These cameras are as simple to use as any I have ever seen and the quality of the pictures are as good or better than cameras costing 3 times as much. Great Buy
This timer system is beyond helpful - it becomes your BRAIN when you have a newborn, as the hours, feedings and diaper changes become a total blur during this amazing yet totally sleep deprived time of your life.  While it would be nice to have a few more features like total ounces drank, whether the diaper was a wet one or a doodie, and tracking of daily totals for everything - that'd be more of a infantcare PDA, and is a bit beyond the scope of this little device.  All it aims to be is a timer that will keep track of the key stats in your baby's life, consequently making your life way easier.  I wake up in middle of the night and the baby is grunting, for example.    I click the backlight button and see that in fact the baby has only been asleep for an hour, and had a diaper and bottle right before that.  Then I just go back to sleep.  On the other hand, he beguns grunting and making noises and I see the Itzbeen says it's been 2 hours 30 minutes since his last bottle or diaper, and I know it's time to get up and feed him. ---  --- It's also great for team caregiving, as my husband can hand me the Itzbeen after doing his morning shift, and I automatically know when the last change and bottle were.  We use the wildcard button to track bottle expirations too. ---  --- Thumbs up for the developers of this cool gadget - I hope to see an "Itzbeen II" w/ some advanced features in time for my next baby - although keeping it simple does help keep it easy and quick to use, especially in the fog of a 1am, 3am, and 5am feeding schedule!  (my son never got the memo that full term babies are only supposed to eat every 3 or 4 hours :
Was given this book as a freebie--someone must be buying up copies.  For an Austinite, this adoring account of the life of a hasbeen fifth-string techno-celebrity is a little embarrassing in its breathlessness--kind of reminds one of the courtiers who saluted when Louis the XIV's chamber pot was carried by, except this isn't the Sun King, guys.  Get a life, or at least an authentic artist to swoon over--all of Garriott's stuff was strictly derivative.  Now that we have the real Lord of the Rings to watch, who cares about cheap imitations
I can't believe the other people giving this high marks. I love the wheel, but darn if this isn't just terrible. There isn't even a single on it; I can't believe the studio released it. Thank god I got a promotional copy and didn't have to go buy it in the store. The Catherine Wheel needs to get back together--quick
I bought this mat, because my gym recently began offering yoga classes, and the mats they supplied soon got pretty grody.  This mat is longer and thicker than the gym's version, looks a lot nicer, and has a good 'tacky' feel under my bare feet.  And it was cheaper than comparable mats at local stores.  It's easy to hand wash (and comes with instructions), so I can keep it clean.  Overall, it's a great yoga mat. 
I love this movie it is a "comfort" movie for me as this was one of my favs as a kid and I still love it today
We caught this movie on PBS when it first came on, and my daughter was hooked.  It's a change from the regular Arthur animation - this one is computer animated.  She was very intrigued by that fact, and then the story is about a puppy... well there you go!  The story is well written, a little scary at times when the guard dogs are chasing after Pal.  There are even a few catchy tunes as well.  Highly recommend this to every Arthur fan out there
Can't beat this cabinet for the price. --- Pine wood makes it very light, but sturdy. --- Looks nice on the wall
This is the French X-rated version of 99 women, directed by Jess Franco. The running time of this feature is 98 minutes, which means that this is probably the longest, least censored version of the film that is available. The story involves a women`s island prison, a sadistic female warden, a lustful male governor, and the young, lovely female inmates. Can you see where this is heading ? There ARE scenes of extreme sexuality (especially when you consider the film was released in 1969) which include (...). My big problem with this movie is that the hardcore scenes are haphazardly edited into the film. In a few cases, they don`t even seem to be part of the scenes that you have been watching. Also frustrating is the fact that some of the actors taking part in the sex scenes look nothing like the actors that they are doubling (standing-in)for. Just because a woman is wearing a blonde wig does not mean she is going to look like the lead actress that she is portraying. I guess that this movie was pushing the boundaries in 1969, but looking at the dumb story, lousy editing, and sex scenes from a 2005 perspective.....this is just a dated curio
Thought this would save time and be easier than a blow dryer and round brush, but no. My hair is long-ish and kind of fine/straight. The brushes would not grab the hair enough like my regular round hair brush. So, I couldn't get the  full volume results I wanted. I can see how those with thick or wavy hair would fare better. It is very loud though. I returned mine
To keep it from cracking, I am using mineral oil on mine and keeping it out of the weather
Great product! I have had a little experience with FrontPage, but this product is definitely not FrontPage with a new look. This is an easy to use yet professionally powerful tool for web page development. It goes way beyond my abilities. If Microsoft continues to develop this product the way it has started....then watch out DreamWeaver
I recently purchased this game using a gift certificate.  My little boy LOVES it. I think it's quite interesting as well but there were several typos on the game cards.  Frankly, there needs to be better proof reading.  Was this game assembled and printed in another country other than the USA.  That would probably account for it
If you liked the original then you will also like KH2. It finishes the story nicely. Battle commands are improved - I especially like the Reaction commands. Still has some camera issues. Overall a good game
I had an older Canon camcorder that I was very happy with, so I decided to get this new one. I ended up shipping it back because the tape noise was so loud. I even tried the same model at Best Buy to make sure it wasn't just a defective camera. But compared to a similar Sony model, the Canon was noticeably louder while operating. Way to loud for shooting anything resembling quiet conditions
The grocery store is saturated with products that are high in sugar and fat and frankly I've become weary reading labels. I've started to buy more and more organic products and find that many of them meet or exceed my expectations for flavor and quality.  ---  --- Nature's Path Organic Apple Cinnamon Toaster Pastries do taste "slightly" healthy, but they remind me of some nutmeg cookies I make that are also made with whole-wheat flour.  ---  --- Ingredients: Organic apple cinnamon filling (organic evaporated cane juice, organic apple juice concentrate, water, organic evaporated apples, vegetable glycerin, organic apple powder, organic corn startch, organic cinnamon, locust bean gum), organic whole-wheat flour, organic white flour, water, organic evaporated cane juice, organic palm oil, powdered organic eveaporated cane juice, organic invert syrup, salt, leavening, natural flavor, agar, tocopherols (for freshness).  ---  --- Unfortunately these do contain palm oil, although I don't seem to be as allergic to organic palm oil. Makes me wonder what I'm really allergic to, as in what is in the additional element in the non-organic Palm Kernel Oil. Could it simply be that this is the non-hydrogenated version. Could be.  ---  --- Each pastry is 190 Calories  --- 40 Calories from Fat  ---  --- They heat up fast in the toaster and are convenient for a snack.  ---  --- ~The Rebecca Review
I purchased this for use in my bathtub.  It is more comfortable than the blow-up ones and stays cleaner. 
A group of male pals are at the wedding of a friend.  When he gets married, Jerry O'Connell, (as "Michael") and the rest of the men agree to never get married, be single and be a "Tomcat".  Horatio Sanz (as "Steve") agrees too, but the next thing they know, he gets married too.  Michael and Steve are still friends.  Everytime Michael meets a woman, bad luck happens and he gets in trouble with thugs or the law.  He's a innocent as can be.  Horatio Sanz (NBC's Saturday Night Live) is hilarious and a delight in this film. Billy Hufsey plays a "Pit Boss"
A bunch of junk.  Not any of the really meaty excersises.  An excuse for the auhor to make money
this is the soundtrack that led me into the wonderful world of glam rock!  it is outstanding and i could just play it again and again....  it is certainly one of the most brilliant albums out there and probably my favourite soundtrack of all time. --- 
THREE SIX MAFIA has out done there self with this new guy CHROME --- about every song is decent which is hard to find these days 
I never got my order even after a month after I placed it.  They reply to you email with false info.  Always saying its on the way.  One item that i did get was the wrong item.  You have been warned. Be very careful from these guys.
I recieved a couple of these while in college as a gift and have been using them ever since.  Up until now I have aways had a hard time finding them.  I have been usinghte same two for years now and I gotta tell you, washclothes come and go but these still look almost new after all these years.  I am  so glad I can stock up on these!!  Buy them, you will ove them.  I have ultra sensitive skin and these washclothes are outstanding for exfoliating
We bought these skates for our 5 year old. She could barely skate in them. They are too big and bulky for children just learning to skate.  We returned them and have yet to find another pair
wow, how i can write a review about the item i have not received so far. i ordered this case on march 7th and to day is april 10th and it seems out of stock so far.well, i,m still waiting........
I just got my first case of this fabric softener last week and yesterday, I was walking downstairs when the smell of lavender hit me - I was surprised because I hadn't sprayed any lavender freshener in the air, when I realized that my boyfriend was doing a load of laundry.  Like Seventh Generation's lavender laundry detergent, I love this product - if you use them in tandem, not only do your clothes smell like *real* lavender (not the chemically-based smells of mainstream products), but they come out clean and soft.  I especially like the lavender smell for my sheets and blankets and it's gentle enough to use on my baby's clothes, too!  I love that it's made with natural products and real lavender essential oil.  It's also safe for my septic system, so I'm sold on this product.  If you're sensitive to the chemical-based scents of the mainstream fabric softeners or can't find one that smells good to you, try this one! 
My son has been using this table for the last 3 months and absolutely loves it.  He also has the LeapFrog table, but gets bored with just one.  This table is on the opposite side of our (toy-filled) living room, and he will go over to this for a change of pace.  He loves Elmo and likes to hang on to his head and also mouth it.  He likes to use the phone, which he also mouths - just assume he puts his mouth on everything :) - and also the little bowl under Cookie Monster.  So why four stars and not five?  I do wish the base had a bit more weight to it, but he can easily pull up on it without getting the whole toy over although we've had a couple of near tips.  Also, the toy is a little less educational than I feel it could be since he is always accidentally setting off buttons with his arm...so he could be pressing the triangle with his finger, but his arm could press the Pig...and off Elmo goes oinking and singing about pigs.  Still a great toy, with lots of entertainment value, and as he matures we have less accidental set-offs.  I bought it on sale and it was worth the money
That is my husbands' view; he's the one who eats habanero peppers like they're radishes!!- he love's this sauce; he adds it to his own salsa blends to make them hot enough to melt your tonsils... he has quite a following for his home-made sauces.  When he can't get fresh habeneros he uses Dave's to turn up the heat
Case is pretty much what you see...I have no complaints. =)  The case protects my camera very well
Hi, --- I am sure I will love it, but I ordered it on Feb. 15th. and still haven't received the magazine. Maybe it is just published every few months. I do look forward to receiving the magazine. --- Sincerely, --- Becky Watkin
Great to own such a John Candy/Dan Akroid classic.  Not recommended for children. Quite a lot of profanity
This product worked OK for 3 months then the shredder began to fall apart. There are little finger like pieces (that are breaking off) underneath the shredding area which began to collect paper and cause the paper to backup and jammed in the shredding mechanism. The more fingers that fall off, the faster paper backs up and gets jammed. So after every 10-15 pages I have to get out a pair of needlenose pliers and pull the impacted paper out of these tiny slots. It takes about 10 minutes of extreme frustration to unclog this clunker. That's about a minute a page. This is obviously completely unacceptable because if I had enough time to spend 1 minute to shred each piece of paper I would be paper mache artist.  --- Now, I just use it to store paper until I buy a new shredder. This product was a complete disappointment for me
Purchased this edition of TaxCut last week.  On WIN XP2 the software installed cleanly and it downloaded the updates without any issues.  I imported last year's data in less than a minute and I had my return completed in less than 1 hour.  This includes capital gains/losses, dividends, and AMT calculations.  It doesn't get much easier than this. --- Yes, you have to download updates.  The IRS is still making changes to the tax codes long after this software has to be packaged and sent to the stores.  The alternative would be to download the whole package online when you buy it, but wouldn't that take at least as long
With Perverse, Mike Edwards set out to prove that Jesus Jones was more than a `sunny, breezy pop band', what he ended up proving was that if they weren't no one was interested. Sad to say, but pop hooks were what people expected from JJ, and actually there are some here, but they are smothered by industrial/techno gook. Stick with DOUBT, that's where JJ peaked, even if some claimed they had `sold out'. Here they are pushing the boundaries, but that doesn't always make for a great listening experience
I've worked with Pinnacle Studio versions 8.0, 9.0, 9.4., 10.0, and this one.  And they've all had two things in common: ---  --- 1.  When the program works, it's superb. ---  --- 2.  The other 50% of the time, it crashes frequently, and hard. ---  --- For years, Pinnacle had designed the market's top, novice-affordable video editing/authoring platforms, but for some frustrating reason, they just can't seem to keep the bugs out.  Studio Plus v10.5 is no exception. ---  --- Lately, the competition in this market has mushroomed, and there are better alternatives available for the same price.  At last, others have emulated the Pinnacle platform while eliminating the work/creativity-killing bugs. ---  --- My advice?  Shop around.  Google the competition.  But save yourself the frustration and steer away from anything Pinnacle
I wont go into the quality of this product or the nutritional benefits as I think the 4.5 stars and the customer reviews speak for themselves. However, I think you will find the 54 oz for 20 bucks is the best deal on the Internet, especially when you buy two and choose the super saver shipping option. I would challenge anybody to find a better deal for pure coconut oil of the same quality
The first watch had a broken crown the date could not be changed.To amazons credit,they sent me a new one right away.This watch is fine.I needed a rubber band because I am in water a great deal of the time at workand I live near the ocean.I am always in the water with my children.So far the watch is great and has held up to expectations.No problems except when the first one was shipped broken.I would buy it again
I bought this case for use at work. I work in a semi-dusty shop environment. I'm always bumping up against benches and shelving and this case has held up very well. I don't have to worry about the screen getting scratched (The screen on the Sansa e2oo series scratches very easily) with the hard plastic screen protector. I am very pleased with the Speck Toughskin and have recommended it to several friends and co-workers.
I got this bag for a Samsung Digimax i got for a friend, and is a very nice, and usefull bag, she can put there, the camera, her cell phone, replacement batteries, memory stick and some keys :
I (and more importantly, my twin boys) really like this jumper.  It seems safer than the doorway jumper, mainly because their fingers won't get mushed.  I like that it has multiple height settings and that it's on a sturdy frame.  They love to jump in it, and before they were able to crawl, it was one of the few ways for them to get out some of that excess energy and get some exercise.  Plus, it's a nice safe place for times when I'd like to get something done without having to keep a constant eye on one of the babies.   ---  --- The cons (that wouldn't keep me from buying it again) are: it takes up more room than a doorway jumper, the rattly bear is pretty loud, and the music is obnoxious.  There is an on-off switch and two volume settings for the music, though
Early Louis Malle film based on the true life story of Per Jacques.  The film brings to life an understanding of true martyrdom.  This is the stuff of saints such as Maximilian Kolbe, Edith Stein, and Pere Jacques
   This magazine is ill!  I learn about all the new albums coming out, read the review,and if they say they are good, i go out  and buy 'em.  The reviews are also accurate, giving the appropiate number of stars.   I also love the sections on the new artists on the verge.  The cover stories never seem to dis-please me, always givin' me plent of info.  The mini articles are cool, too, from stuff like Warren's Sapp's all-star football team, to all about how Mike Jones was discovered.  One last thing I love about the magazine - they are never thin issues, and you know what that means!!!  
The fatigues were just what my son wanted.  The only thing wrong was that there was no inseam available to order.  I guess on fatigues you are suppose to use the drawstring at the bottom.  But my son didn't want that so I had to hem about four inches on each leg.  Other than that it was an excellent product
I had several of these shipped to my Mum in law's in California for sending to me in France where we work and live. Because of a decent delivery speed, and her thinking they looked OK, I gave them a rating of 5 Stars. ---  --- Today, after even having BOILED them in water, hoping for shrinkage, I am sad to say that nothing happened. ---  --- They are horrid to wear, I oredered a medium size and the fit is that of XXXXXXXL. ---  --- DO NOT BUY THIS HORRORS. I wish I could get my hard earned money back, as now I'm wondering if I was the brunt of a joke in Nightmare Alley. ---  --- You've got to be con artist to sell these things
I would like to note I am NOT a fan of the Riddick movie, Though A blade this unique tends to get your attention reguardless! This knife is very practical, It's a solid piece of metal all around. I own a pair of these and used them on a grounded, wooden post for hours! Yet after my use they shown no sign of bends, Chips or dents! They shipped to me dull, But hey I don't mind sharpening them myself. A word of caution, You can seriously injure someone with these! Their odd form makes them very deadly if sharpened as well as mine are
I bought this lens to go with my Canon Digital Rebel XT.  I absolutely love this lens.  I got it to try some insect and other macro shots and it has served this purpose very well.  With some practice this lens will produce fantastic macros with some great bokeh to boot.   --- I read the other reviews and must say that I have never scared an insect away with the noise as mentioned before.  And I have taken countless insect shots with this lens.  It is a bit louder than the other lenses I have but I don't see it to be a problem.  The one problem I do encounter is when using the autofocus in a busy closeup scene it often will focus on the background instead of say a closer insect on a flower.  When this happens I just flip it to manual and focus that way.  No big deal. --- Overall, great lens for an even greater price.  Definitely worth it.  (I submitted a photo of a bee that I took a couple of days ago with this lens as an example.)  
This "book" is probably the worst written I've ever encountered. It was so flawed as to be considered literature. Alice Walker tries to "One-up" Harriet Beecher Stowe, in writing about brutality. Titles like these are weapons used in the Anti-Black Male agenda this society has long perpetuated. All the men depicted in this book are one-dimensional characters with absolutely no redeeming qualities worth noting. The women are portrayed as martyred, forlorn, pseudo-saints who have been set upon by beasts from hell.  ---  --- The only persons capable of any sort of humanity are exclusively women. I've learned long ago, when absolutes such as these are presented, a greater agenda is at work. There are no "real" men in this book! Only distorted caricatures of Black masculinity. I only found value in this book as a comprehensive example of sexist misandry at its worst. I find this title as dangerous as Hitler's "Mien Kampf", in it's portrayal of Black men as evil and morally destitute.  ---  --- Presenting such depictions is both dangerous and irresponsible. True, there are criminally abusive men in every culture. But there are also forthright, upstanding  men as well. To present a depiction of such vehement imbalance and disparity, only serves to distort the readers view of the people being written about.  ---  --- Harriet Beecher Stowe's fictional "Uncle Tom's Cabin", sparked national outrage and eventually a bloody civil war. This title does no less in further distorting the readers perceptions of Black Men.  ---  --- This book is fiction. However,it is not presented as such. I'm sure the abusive incidents depicted in this book have been based upon actual incidents. I have no qualm about outrage at such abominations. However, I do have a problem when there are absolutely no upstanding male figures who intervene in such aberrations. That is what I find so unbelievable and offensive about this book.  ---  --- In my opinion, this novel does nothing to laud the strength of women so much as it demeans and distorts the readers/viewers of the people within it. I don't find it a testament to the strength of Black Women at all. I interpret this book as feminist misandry with two purposes...the further distortion of African-American culture and the deliberate depiction and denigration of the Black Male as being hopelessly inhuman. ---  --- I'm sure Alice walker made a lot of money with this book. Feminist, racist extremism seems to have found a niche in literature. I wonder if this novel would have had the same accolades, were it a fictional depiction of White American Men brutalizing White Women. Most definitely not!!! I doubt it would have even found a publisher. America is comfortable reinforcing negative depictions of Black Men and African-American culture. ---  --- My life as a Black man is difficult enough living as a testament and example against this sort of racial distortion. Whatever Ms. Walker's motivations were in writing this novel, I'm sure mercenary incentives were not discounted.  ---  --- This is racist, misandrist propaganda masquerading as literature! ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  --- 
If you like CSI: Miami this dvd will not dissapoint. It has great picture quality and sound I have also purchased the third and fourth seasons
Why the production team of this movie didn't film in New Orleans is beyond my comprehension. When I first saw this movie, I could see based on the footage that it was filmed in Canada. The terrain is totally different from south Louisiana. It looked like a movie set. I guess the set designers thought they could put a few stands of fake Spanish moss on the trees and a hunk of it in the fountains and a banana tree in that corner and a palm in the other. It looked like a theme park! The streets looked too clean. For some reason they could not depict the elegance of decay of old New Orleans which to me is paramount in the telling of these people's lives but maybe I am being too technical. All the principle characters  all had straight teeth and clear skin. Back in the 1840's just about everybody had some sort of illness then and they looked it. The actor who played Marcel could not act. The actor who played his white father did not age at all for 18 years. Still looked the same, yet he had very young children by his white wife who he married 18 years before. The architecture of the plantation house was also wrong. It was'nt even French --- No live oaks anywhere which are major icons in southern Louisiana.The supporting actors and actresses were quite good.Let me just say this, white men maintaining women of color was not only prevelent in New Orleans but also other states in the south, the difference is is that in New Orleans, the white master would leave them property and money. Not so in other southern states.The more beautiful the woman, the more she would receive from the white man.The placage system in New Orleans was a business arrangement and it worked for both parties.
Comfy, tough, lightweight, wrinkly (like me). Surprisingly durable considering how thin the fabric is. Good stitching. Velcro® back pockets will save your wallet! Doesn't offer lots of stupid exterior loops and gear-freak cargo pockets. Not for the tidy country-club set who need creases on everything, but just perfect for active soccer Dads or when the family hound insists on playing Fetch with muddy logs and the like
Painstakingly compiled by Judy Brown (contributing writer and comedy critic for LA Weekley), The Funny Pages is an impressive and hilarious collection of 1,473 jokes gathered from the funniest modern-day comedians around, ranging from Robin Williams to Bill Cosby, George Burns, Conan O'Brien, and many, many more. The individual jokes are arranged by topic underneath dictionary-style headings. From Alcohol to Yoga and Zoos; each gag is short but sweet, and packs a punch in this chuckle-inducing, highly recommended anthology of wit, gags, and humor both classic and cutting edge
Well I guess the title says most of it. I am not happy with them they turn a dark brown just walking across the yard so I have to put them in the washing machine with bleach A LOT. Then the place where the laces go at the top are all frayed. I've tried to was them by hand with bleach so it wont fry but it dosen't work they look the same as before. But they are comfortable I also like the high arch in them. They are pretty when they fist come out of the box but if you are planing on doing any outdoor actives I wouldn't recommend them
  ---  I was very pleased with the light sabers, I gave them to my two grandsons for Christmas and they loved them, they were made very well, my grandsons are 7 and 5 years old and they played pretty rough with them, they had lots of fun with them
I gave this stroller as a gift. So far there have been no problems.
I've owned and discarded numerous chargers.  This one is great - the retractable wire is very convenient for storage and use.  It looks pretty fragile, but so far it's held up to pretty heavy use.  Many of the other chargers I've owned have also had problems keeping a consistent connection - no such problems with this one
This is The Jacksons second album for epic and producers Gamble and Huff. It would be their last with Gamble and Huff but together they made a great album that doesnt get the play it should. Music's Takin Over, Different Kind of Lady and Do What You Wanna are great, catchy dance tracks. The real greatness here lies in the ballads where Michael's voice is in peak form. Even Though You're Gone and Find Me A Girl are classic ballads. So good, I feel that Find Me A Girl is probably the best Michael Jackson song you've never heard. This is probably Michael Jackson's most overlooked album and its one of his best! The Jacksons all sing together great and you can see why Destiny and Triumph were such big hits after this one was recorded. Overall, great ballads, catchy feel good dance tracks, and Michael Jackson singing his heart out. Get this, you will not be dissaponted
Even though it looks like it will not fit at the beginning , it fits perfecly. Evenflo also gives you an extention piece with it. We needed this piece for our size opening , we really had to squeeze it in , but it is a great fit. The gate is sturdy and pleasing to the eye. It took about 2 days for us to get used to the locking mechanism , using 2 hands at first. After some practice it was easy to use. We liked it so much that we bought another .
This live album/in-studio acoustic EP is hard to figure. Most of the live stuff is selected from BLS's "Stronger Than Death" album, which wasn't all that great to begin with. The only good thing being; that album was so poorly mixed that live versions of "All For You" and "13 Years Of Grief" sound much better and immediate than their studio counterparts. A new heavier version of "No More Tears" tries to please, but fails by showing Zakk Wylde's gruff vocals don't always work. Unexpectedly, the bonus acoustic EP is the far better attraction. "Like A Bird" is the best song Neil Young never wrote and "Blood In The Well" shows Zakk's soloing chops in full form. BLS needed some better songs before doing a live record. End of story
The one song I know is a remake is "Goodnight My Love."  I know this because I have it on the original 45 issue and the CD version is an inferior remake.  But the others with which I'm familiar - but don't have original vinyl to compare, only memories - seem authentic. ---  --- The audio quality is great and certainly superior to some of the CDs you find these days which are only re-recordings of old vinyl or cassettes.
What is this all about.  I have not ordered this item nor do I have it.  Please reply
This bench is a must have for outdoor sports. This is the second instabench we have bought as the other one wore out.  It is sturdy and can comfortably fit a coach along with many players on this bench.  The bench itself is a little heavy and bulky but portable enough to throw into the car and go.  The frame is made well.  There were only two issues that I had with the bench.  The first is that the plastic material on the bottom of the seat separated from the top seating material.  Second is the carrying case ripped after a few months of carrying it back and forth to the fields. The top sides ripped along with where the shoulder strap meets the material on the bag.     therefore the rate of 4 stars
This product to my knowledge is completely untested.  I suspect it because it says it requires no boiling--which sugestes that it may contain a preservative, yeast and/or bacterial inhibitor.  This could not possibly be good for the hummers. ---  --- Listen to the experts such as Sheri Wlliamson (Peterson's "Hummingbirds of North America.")  Sugar and water is just fine, filtered water best but NOT distilled
Comparisons to the 1937 classic are inevitable. Story-wise, there is little difference except for the colonization of the remake. Many of the frames are carbon copies of each other. This reviewer feels that the b&w format of the original added to the suspense. The original cast is clearly superior especially the male leads of Ronald Coleman, David Niven and C. Aubrey Smith. Also, Douglas Fairbanks Jr. outshines James Mason as Rupert of Hentzau, the main bad guy. (I wonder if a stunt man performed that high dive.) A nice gesture is the cameo role of Lewis Stone,  the star of the 1922 SILENT version. It is the 1952 female leads who compare most favorably: Deborah Kerr comes very close to equaling Madeleine Carroll as the lovely Queen Flavia, with her strong (!) sense of duty. And Jane Greer probably surpasses Mary Astor's 1937 role. Both Mary and Jane are key to the plot. Watch them closely! Blessedly, despite the many frame similarities, the remake does not carbon copy the 1937 fadeout, with Ronald Coleman's gallant wave of farewell. On its' own merits, the 1952 version is a very credible adventure story indeed. It only suffers from comparison to an original classic it cannot possibly surpass
It was about time the spell Kasey Chambers originally cast on me wore off - I'd become a huge fan of The Captain and Barricades & Brickwalls, but there was all something a little nagging about even those two very good records.  Chambers, a unique betty boop squeak of a voice, was a lustrous presence in rootsy contexts, and the best moments of those records were snarky updates on an old form, but the worst moments were forgettable alt-country duldrums of patched together cliches.  Wayward Angel, Chambers' third album, had some great songs on it, but its pop and country predictability overtook a good half of the album.  Carnival shows Chambers at her weakest - sad girl anthems of generic empowerment about the rain, bad girl anthems of doin-wrong that sound about as risky as songs on The Disney channel's afternoon lineup.  "Light Up A Candle" fakes its slinkiness and turns dull, "Surrender" adds a Dido production of drum machines and computer bleeps that don't mask the song's epic ordinariness,  ballads like "Dangerous" limp along to their own generic lethargy.  Chambers isn't without charm - "Sign On The Door" and "I Got You Now" are impossible to not find fun - yet Chambers worst instincts as a song writer threaten to take over even the good songs - "Hard Road," a sad and moving movie-ready duet, borders on self-parody - lines like "There's a heavy jacket/ there's a heavy load/ there's a weight on my shoulders/ it's a hard road" read like a laundry list of related lines from every sad and moving movie-ready song you've ever heard
This is a product I was not sure about just from seeing the picture.  Once it arrived, I was very pleased with my choice.  The picture doesn't do it justice.  It is very sturdy and the rubber grip helps too!!!  Great gift for a man or woman that loves to grill
Despite all of the controversy over its violent content, the Grand Theft Auto series of videogames deliver time after time with the best entertainment bang for your buck. In my opinion Grand Theft Auto: Vice City is the best game out of the series so far. Yes, the missions are a bit easier than those in San Andreas, but Vice City is a better overall experience. The setting is beautiful, there are more properties that you can own, and the automotive,firearm and weapon selections are also quite large. The soundtrack to this game is amazing. From 80's pop to metal to old school rap and hillarious talk radio, its all here. Grand Theft Auto is the greatest videogame series ever because it combines fun, challenges, and elements of real life triumphs and consequences in one well produced package
I like water, but I still like these packets. All you do is put the mix in shake it up, and it's lemonade. It's like magic. They are perfect for anywhere, and they taste good too. They are great for traveling. I absoulutley love them
When this toy is turned on it seriously sounds like an air-raid siren is going off.  I can't use my usual trick of putting tape over the speaker because you need to be able to hear the instructions to play the games. ---  --- Also, the counting/shape game is confusing.  There is a row of shapes with numbers on them, and the game asks the child to, for example, find 3 rectangles.  It's trying to get the child to press the rectangle shape three times, but the rectangle shape is marked with the number 8.  There's a circle marked with the number 3. ---  --- The only reason I'm not giving this one star is because my son enjoys playing the "repeat the tone" and "count the villians" games.  I'm not sure how much longer the adults in the house can handle the siren noise, though, I may try to hide this and get him a leapfrog toy instead
while i am not a big fan of john mcLaughlin or mahvishnu orchestra - i cannot deny that they really had something with this album.. It is something new - not just an extension of miles davis - they were breaking new territory...  There is a cohesiveness amongst the band members - of course abounding with improvisational talent - this is fushion but first of all it is music
This smells good and the heart shape is cute. But, it lost it's scent when it dissolved which was dissipointing and the flowers turned the water darkish. I liked it but it's not one of my favorites.
I've been looking for Stella D'Oras' Round Egg Biscuits, they were a very dry airy kind of cookie, they had plain and frosted.  I loved the plain ones, they were round but had a scallopped edge to them with a hole in the center.  I can't find these anywhere and wish I could, if anyone knows where to find these please let me know
I bought this product because I thought Norton was a quality product. Man did I make a mistake buying this product. I only had it on my computer for 1 month and it made my computer crawl , almost to where it would not  hardly work. I deleted it . Then my computer starting working just fine. This happened to me 2 times before I got tired of it and trashed it.
Very good stealth type game. This game is really addicting and keeps you playing. Its a really intense game, and gets harder level by level. One of them games where it makes you think, you gotta think what your next move should be. Like coming up to a room and theres 2 guards patrolling it, should you take them out? Or sneak past them? Alot of stuff like that. Hands down a really fun game
Stu's wit and cleverness shines through on every page, making what could be only drab descriptions into entertainment even for those who know these tricks by heart.  If you like this, get a copy of Stuart Crump's *It's  Yo-Yo Time!* which includes not only tricks, but history, articles, and  fiction on yo-yos -- all of top quality
I've been kicked out of two country clubs for using the Butthead Golf Club Cover, and it appears the only club that allows my membership has been Playworld Putt Putt. There's also no dress code involved there. ---  --- Now, on to the review! ---  --- I strongly endorse this Butthead Golf Club Cover because it adds an element to golf that would otherwise be forgotten: fun! Those teets really help my handicap like you wouldn't believe. Many clubs have a problem with this cover, because they're incredibly elitist, but when I think of golf, I think of cow teets, and that's why I refuse to play without it
I'm not exactly sure how to classify this, nor do I think it really deserves the time.  How this album has garnered so many positive reviews is beyond me.  My only guess is that some tired, pretentious teen on MySpace raved over it and voila, the clique was born.   ---  --- Now, I really wanted to like this and gave it numerous listens.  But each time, it sounds more and more like these guys were just doing some busy work around the house, started humming some melodies and then recorded them.  Immature and pretty much unoriginal.  And just because an album is labeled "concept" doesn't automatically qualify it as a masterpiece.  If you want a flawless concept album that actually has an interesting story just go and buy "The Wall".  Unless your circle of friends has threatened to emascualte you for not owning this, don't bother with this bloat. 
I'm sorry but the guy below me doesn't know music if he was slapped with a Gang starr cd. This mess is ridiculous. I wouldn't even want to hear this garbage in the klub let alone banging in my car. They are the modern day version of Young mc....here today gone tomorrow
I recently purchased a pair of the Gripmaster Hand & Finger Exercisers in order to help build forearm strength.  As I was unsure which tension would be appropriate, I bought one each of the Light/Blue (5 lbs. tension) and Medium/Red (7 lbs. tension) grips.  I've had them for a little more than a week now, and I just love, love, love them!  Perhaps that's a little more enthusiasm than anyone should muster up for exercise accessories, but I really do enjoy the grips.  I leave one out on my desk at all times, and get in a little work here and there when I stop to read a document or whatnot.   ---  --- The Gripmaster Exercisers are different from conventional grips in that you can either work your entire hand at once, or each finger individually (great for guitar players, I've heard!).  One side features four small levers, each with its own spring, that can be squeezed together or one at a time.  The plastic on the flip side is molded together so that you can work your whole hand as one unit.  The black rubber cushion is removable, and you can place it on either side of the grip.  It's an awesome idea, and allows for maximum versatility!   ---  --- Just for reference, I'm a female, in relatively good shape, but with painfully little forearm strength (my biceps are huge from years of Tae Bo, though!).  The 7 lb. Medium/Red grip is do-able, but challenging.  The 5 lb. Light/Blue grip, on the other hand, makes for a much easier workout; I oftentimes find myself squeezing it while doing other things, and I only feel it after a number of reps.  If you're a female and not in great shape, you'll want to start out with the Light/Blue grips (or even the Extra Light/Yellow ones), and work your way up.  Out-of-shape guys can probably get away with the Medium/Red ones to start.  If you've got good hand/wrist/forearm strength, don't even both with the lighter tensions - skip ahead to the Medium/Red or Heavy/Black.    ---  --- Although I've only owned my Gripmasters for a week or two, and can't personally vouch for their durability, they do seem sturdy and well-crafted.  My fianc's brother, an amateur boxer and guitar player, used his for years without a problem, so I have faith that I'll be squeezing these babies well into 2015! ---  --- - Kelly Garbato, Couch Potato Turned Fitness Fanati
These boots are GORGEOUS! I got such an awesome deal on these boots; I searched online for about an hour to find another website that has a picture of them! I'll put one up here. They're comfy, rich leather, well made. I've always wanted Frye boots
The thermometer looks good and is easy to use.  Unfortunately the temperature it gave was so inaccurate (more than two degrees off) that I had to return the product
I've always fondly remembered this movie. Bette Midler and Danny De Vito have perfect comic timing. :-D 
I bought this on a whim because I just remodeled my house after Hurricane Katrina and now have a huge jacuzzi tub...nice to take long baths in so of course I needed some bubble stuff.  The bath bombs smell wonderful.  My whole bathroom smelled of the bath bombs until I used them all.  I even put the box they came in into my closet and it made my closet smell wonderful (for about a week)!  The bombs each have something special inside of them that you find out about when they dissolve.  The fizzing is fun and the smell lingered on my skin until the next day.  I loved them and will definitely buy more
I bought this item based on safety and comfort reviews from consumer reports and I'd have to say the reviews I read about on the Titan were dead on.  My 7 month old is very long for his age and he loves the freedom this seat provides as opposed to the cramped car seat we were using.  I also like the fact that as he grows into a toddler and is able to sit forward I can still use this seat - I wish I had bought this seat from the get go
I've used this product for recipes such as chicken pot pie and shepherds pie.  To get height, I whip the batter in my stand mixer to ensure lots of air bubbles are trapped to support the mix as it cooks.  They've turned out great and you can't tell it's gluten-free.  I've had less luck making biscuits out of it -- came out hard -- but that seems to be a hazard in any gluten-free flour mix
Ive never done a review before because I have never been so disgusted with a product. ---  --- Ive had mine a few weeks. Used it twice a week.. which equals roughly 10 uses so far. Well, just now the little knob that gets screwed in to hoold the arm in place to prevent it from swinging BROKE.. cracked right in half as I was turning it with my fingers. I didnt even put any weight into it!! ---  --- Last week the nut that holds the eye hook and entire weight of the heavy bag fell off sending my bag crashing to the ground. I dont know why they wouldnt put something more permanent up there instead of a 2 cent nut. ---  --- The design is terrible. Rather than have the supports and screw holes run the length of the wall studs they have then run so you  mount two in the studs two in the drywall.. unless of course you do the wood mount like another user suggested ( which is what I did ). ---  --- TKO just lost me. I will NEVER buy ANYTHING from them again. Seventy dollars for this CHinese made garbage. Im sure the welds will be the next thing to go.  ---  --- Buyer bewar
This cable came in a cheap packing and it does not have any logo on it so you can't say which company it belongs to. I have used a lot of sony products and I feel it is not up to the standard of sony.  --- It works great had no problems so far. It is flexible kinds so you don't have to worry about positioning your laptop according to your TV.
I'm very sorry, but the universal remote control was not what I expected.Like, when I want to turn on my tv. the vcr came on and visa versa.  But the company was very helpful and quick to let me send it back and refunded me my money.Very pleased about the service,thanks.Regards Yoka van Dijk.
Buyer beware. These new Journey releases are reissues of their 1996 remastered releases. They are NOT remastered in 2006. Rhino should be ashamed of itself for this (it's been 10 years - I would have gladly paid for a remastered version, but not for new packaging)
I finally convinced my wife we needed to purchase a couple of these for training.  My sons and I will begin training in Kendo soon.  I have a few regular swords (not the display only variety) and are very excited with purchasing some practice swords. ---  --- I understand these come highly recommended after speaking with a couple of Amazon customer
Okami rates among the most beautiful games I've ever seen.   ---  --- The main point of the game is that you're the reincarnation of a god, awakened after a hundred years to dispatch of the evil that's overtaken the land. The entire landscape is bleak and dead--affected by the evil, and it's your task to both fight the ultimate evil, and restore the land using various techniques you learn throughout the game.  ---  --- One of the really interesting aspects of the game is that, since the main character is folk tale diety (in the form of a wolf), the player can affect the environment of the game by drawing with a calligraphy brush. A circle stroke in the sky creates a sun to turn night into day. Another stroke across a dead tree brings it bursting into full bloom. A slashing stroke across your enemies cuts them.  ---  --- My only minor complaint so far is that perhaps it does a little too much shepherding in terms of letting you know where to go next. However, this doesn't detract for the game overall. At the same time, the player does have a good deal of freedom--I haven't felt railroaded through the storyline at all.  Perhaps the extra guidance will make this game more accessible also for people who aren't usually gamers.   ---  --- If you're looking for something visually interesting, occasionally humorous, and with very different gameplay from the usual fare, Okami is highly recommended. 
Ume-En is one of the best brands of green tea powder I have ever tasted. This tea has a light, delicate flavor, with just a touch of sweetness, which serves to make drinking this beverage a delightful, relaxing and rejuvenating experience. With this drink, "tea time" is going to take on a whole new meaning. I would definitely recommend this product
This is the best mustard I have ever had in my life!  Prepared mustard you buy in the store doesn't even come CLOSE to this mustard when you make it according to the directions on the container! Strong hint of horseradish caught me off guard at first, but I love horseradish, so this mustard is the best!  I will never buy prepared mustard from the staore again!  Thank you
I am pleased to get this stuff very soon. However, I thought I got blue one (center of the circle) because they show a picture to customer like blue one. So, I expected to get blue one, but the seller sent me red one. It does not matter the color, but someone like me wants to get the same product you show me by online. Overall, I am satistifed with this product. Well, my metronome has a scratch already, so,, be careful!!
Very sturdy and reasonably priced.  My daughter is just learning to skate and loves that she has her own skates that are "just like the one's at the skating rink". I would recommend these to everyone

i bought this thinking that this would be fun and a decent workout, i tried it a few times but just couldnt get in to it. it go's a bit fast but i know i could get used to it, but they have very big steps and they lung into it and i think it would be better if they work up to it i kept finding myself rewinding it to do the step corretly i dont realy strive for perfection i just want to do it some what right. there are better ones out there than this, but i think i am going to try it again cuz it wasnt so bad that i am going to quit it
I work in NYC and live on Long Island and the watch would never connect. The whole point of th watch was that it did that, but it never did. I returned right away
After seeing this in a magazine, I decided I had to try it so I ordered a small sized tub from Sephora.  OMG what an amazing change to my hair. ---  --- I am a perpetual hair dyer and last year had a perm that I then straightened because I hated it.  Top that off with living in Hawaii prior to that, and between the color, sun, and perm my hair was getting a little sad. ---  --- This stuff is amazing. From the first time I used it, my hair was shiny and very soft.   ---  --- I call it the "dirty hippy hair stuff" since it smells like incense. ---  --- I would definitely recommend this product to anyone. ---  --- If you don't want to pay the Sephora or QVC prices, buy it on ebay.  I have a found a seller there that sells the large tub for $20 cheaper than what you buy it at Sephora for
Everyone who walks in to my room where I have this clock sitting, comments on, and wants to know where I got it.  This is one of my favorite things. 
This book provides some brief but good background to set the context then proceeds to succinctly communicate those aspects of UML one really needs to know
"Houseboat" never arrived here.  I have been patiently waiting at the dock, but no boat.  PLEASE send it at once
a year ago we bought a performance series and was very happy with it until a week ago when upon lighting it the fire spread out of the pit area and melted the controls.  Char broil was unconcerned and indicated that did not sell replacement parts.  No comments whatsoever on the safety.  It seems that replaceing the grill on a yearly basis is expected at Charbroil.  In the past we have used Weber and got ten years from the grill.  I would look at the Weber
I used this maybe 4 times when the "in" stopped functioning, but it mysteriously *would* work in reverse.  I wish I read other people's reviews on this before I bought it. Horrible waste of money
I first got this game about 2 years ago for computer.  Back then, I had a really slow computer, and it didn't work right.  I was so mad that I had wasted 40 dollars on it.  It went on the shelf and waited there for 2 years.  Now I have a better computer and play it all the time.  The earlier reviewer said that the game was extremely difficult, not so.  The guy must have obviously been a moron, and not been able to figure out the puzzles, because the game has an average difficulty, and if he wants it easier, he can play on Padawan.  Anyway, the game is basically a first person shooter based game, where you go around blasting storm troopers, probe droids, and more.  I suggest getting this game because I really enjoy playing it, and I want to get it for XBOX too
I was going to buy this and then stumbled on it in the doctor's office. I love InStyle, Lucky and other shopping mags, but the tone of this is mean and snooty. There are too many ads, and very little content. There's a Q&A section about sex after baby that's just mean, threatening that if you don't jump back in, "one of you will start sleeping with the girl in marketing..." Way to put an anti-feminist tone on sex after baby. Yuck.
I didn't realize there was HFCS (high fructose corn syrup) in these bars. If you work out or are health conscience, then I would suggest doing a little online research about harmful effects of HFCS. I'm about to switch up my protein bars.
I received this toy as a gift for my 1-year old son. It was one of the most frustrating toys he's had. The handle requires too much strenght to press down, so he was not able to operate it alone. He could press it down only when standing up (using his body weight), but the size of the spinner made it very inconvinient to play this way: he had to lean and  crouch. The noise that the balls make is rather loud (in my consideration) and can irritate the adults after a while, too. Because my son was already walking, this static toy got very little attention. The positive features: it is made of sturdy plastic and the colors are nice and bright
Functionally, the iFM is great. I like to use it for workouts at the gym to watch FM transmitted TV's. However, the construction is extremely cheap. I bought two of them and both fell apart. One fell apart the second time I used it. The construction is so cheap that I couldn't put it back together because the controls don't line up. I wish there was an alternative but I can't find one. I like being able to switch between iPod tunes and FM, but will have to carry two devices from now on
Excellent book, if you are interest in ancient egypt, read this book, you'll learn a lot of interesting facts about the valley of the kings, the pharaohs, etc.
  It broke the first time I tried to put it on.  I's very beautiful and the others did just fine.  Thank  you.  Sincerely,  Gai
Everything has been said about this product. When it's working, you're happy. With my 8 version, almost everything was fine. With the 10 version, it's a bloody nightmare. I'm giving up, throwing my Dazzle DVC150 to the junk and looking for another system to transfer my VHS to DVD. NEVER Pinnacle again
I bought this to upgrade my previous version of McAfee Total Protection. The first install was on a laptop, when it configured the wireless security it actually made changes to my WAP setup without notifying me. First of all it said that I didn't have any security set up on the wireless connection (although I have it set up with disabled SSID, MAC filtering, WPA protection...), and after it was done it had changed the setup to WEP... Also causing my other wireless PCs (that don't have McAfee) and my Xbox 360 to no longer connect to the network... So I ended up deinstalling that part.  --- Second PC: regular desktop, after installing the software (only select pieces: antivirus, firewall, spamkiller, privacy service) my multimedia sharing to the Xbox 360 no longer worked. Contacting McAfee support never yielded any usable response ('reinstall' seems to be the default answer ...). Deinstalling/reinstalling didn't help, opening up the firewall didn't help, etc. etc. so I ended up reverting back to my old version of McAfee. --- I consider myself a power PC user, I've set up and configured dozens of PCs over the years, built my own PC, and I can honestly say that I have never used software worse than this one. I hardly ever write reviews, but I had to write this one. Be warned! Maybe McAfee will eventually get its act together, but for me it's time to move on. --- One last comment: this McAfee software (just like prior versions btw) takes up a lot of resources - several services need to run that take up a considerable amount of memory). Not good if you don't have ample memory
We use our batteries a lot.  No problems.  Works as advertised.
Don't know where else to find a garter panty set (arrived fast too) for this price. They say economy, so wasn't expecting much, but we're still enjoying this set to spice up special evenings! We bought the One Size (for a size 8) and it is perfect and adjusts
I bought the 3.5 x 5.5 ruled pocket version. By my standards, the best notebook I've ever used. The perfect size for my jacket or pocket. Acid free paper for long-term archival storage of my notes. Good to use an acid free ink for even longer storage (gel ink pens do not work well with the Moleskine's paper though). Looks professional, and I get a lot of nice comments about it. Much easier to use than turning on my PDA and slowly typing in notes with my thumbs. I also really like the fact that it will open completely flat on a table for easier note writing and reading. When this one is full, I plan to buy another. Price is higher than most, but with this Moleskine, you pay for the quality
This product is a waste of time! Don't bother. The handheld game is entertaining for my daughter, but connecting it online via the website is frustrating to say the least! Once connected, we walked around the "virtual world" with nothing to do. It is too complicated for my 8 yr old to do alone. There are much better products out there for children that are similar, but easier to play with. I would suggest Webkinz or Neopets. These 2 sites are very kid friendly and have educational games to play, unlike the Muichiz site! Good luck..
This is my 5th digital camera. It is the best I have used in this size camera
I got these to give to my mother-in-law. They are really lovely, not too dressy so you can wear them everyday. I'm glad I jumped on them while they were on sale, they'll be perfect for Mother's Day
I have ordered these twice now, they taste so good! I also tried the chocolate wheat-free ones, they were awful, I would not order them again, but have been waiting several weeks for the grahams to be stocked
First, I'd just like to correct the person who said that moleskines have "no actual historical legacy". The Moleskine company may not have been founded until 1992, but moleskine notebooks have been around since before that. The company is not saying that Hemingway, Picasso and Chatwin used their brand of notebooks, they are saying that those people used moleskines. ---  --- But the great thing about these notebooks is not that famous people used them, but that they are of great quality. I highly recommend them
Although I am definitely on the 'Sonicare' bandwagon in so far as this product's ability to clean my teeth--it does a great job--this model brush is made quite poorly.  ---  --- The battery compartment (the e3000 uses 'AA' batteries) on mine, regardless of it having an o-ring on the door, seems to be continually wet inside, with the negative (-) terminal on one of the AA-cells rusting after only two weeks use. Philips acknowledges this is a problem but offers no solution. ---  --- Also, there are many small crevices in/around the nameplate on the side, and a large gap under the nut for the brush-head that accumulates 'gook' on a daily basis. Philips advises that this is probably 'mold' and the brush should be 'disassembled and air-dried' after every use. It takes longer to do this than to brush my teeth-- ---  --- Again, while this is probably one of the best ways to clean your teeth at this point in time, and an economical way to try one of the products that normally start out at $64e (and up), there is no reason why the e3000 shouldn't be made as well as the better units, or hold up to water/daily use as well as some of the $9 Crest electrics we commonly see
Back 2 Da Basics *1/2 Stars ---  --- Yo Gotti has made some decent albums, but this one is just so ridiculous and silly that it made me sick, gotti who thinks he put memphis on the map, has some good songs here and there, but the rest are just ridiculous, obnioxus and real pretentious. ---  --- This is not a good album ---  --- Thumbs Down
This product alone does NONE of the things listed in the descrption BY ITSELF. You must still buy other software to use it. When I questioned them about why they listed it as doing all these things, which it doesn't do, they pointed out where it says "may require 3rd party software for various uses". I just didn't know that the definition of 'various' was ALL USES WE HAVE LISTED.  ---  --- I would rate my experience with this seller as: Dissapointing ---  --- At least let my misfortune be a warning to someone out there somewhere.  ---  --- 
I've received The Whole Dog Journal for the past year.  I have found it to be refreshing as it has no advertisements.  It's pure holistic news, information, health, nutrition, training, food testing, and anything else pertaining to DOGS!  I would recommend this magazine to new dog owners as well as seasoned.  One thing about the world of dogs is that it is ever changing.  It's not always easy to get information that is up-to-date, helpful, and necessary.  With The Whole Dog Journal one can be certain that they will have the best knowledge
H&R block does a much better job marketing software than writing it. I used the on-line version, had trouble registering so chose the option to begin entering data and register later. After about an hour of painfully slow entry, sometimes just one item per page, most of the time looking at "LOADING, PLEASE WAIT" I had to keep an appointment so tried to register and save. No luck, repeated attempts to register gave unidentified error, and I could not save without registering. Finally just left the computer on and left; when I came back TaxCut had timed out and lost all my data. By the way there is a screen which looks like you are accepting the terms of a software agreement but if you read the fine print you are agreeing to let them sell your e-mail to other companies. Even if you select NO you will get frequent e-mails from H&R Block. I will save time and do my taxes on paper forms this year. When a company can't get something simple like this right, it calls into question everything they do
I have very sensitive skin and tried wet shaving with several different electrics and this shave stick beats foam and loation hands down.  As other reviewers point out the stick is made of talc in a parafin base.  It makes dry shaving extremely smooth, as smooth as shaving with foam or lotion but without any of the mess.  You can use this with any type of electric, not just Remingtons, and it's very easy to clean out, just tap it out and/or blow and/or brush.  Highly recommende
I am not an exercise person.  But, I need to keep moving and others in my family have bone issues that mean they shouldn't exercise in a manner that stresses the joints.  This machine is perfect for all of us.  I put the machine together and found it to be quite sturdy and fairly heavy.  The electronics on it are working just fine.  It's the kind of exercise machine that I can get on, watch TV, and forget I'm actually exercising
I bought this item to be used with my Sony HDR-HC3 camcorder in combination the fig rig. It works as advertised. I do wish the clamp portion of the item was removeable, but it can be worked around. I found the remote to be very responsive, as you would expect from Sony. And the price was a bargin.
If you like physics, this is just an interesting book. It mostly discusses, at length, two ideas: emergence and reductionism. Doesn't sound like much, and it isn't, but at least it gives you a different point of view on the world. Unfortunately, from this point of view to the horizon is not that far. Mr. McLaughlin almost calls the present theories (like string theory) science fiction, easy on science (because of the scales and energies involved, he seems to think they are not provable; I don't have the knowledge to discuss if he is right or not), but he doesn't offer much of an alternative. He even comes close to saying that deeper levels of understanding are not possible, or not practical.  --- Well, even if he is right, which I hope he isn't, between can't and science fiction, I prefer science fiction. Tomorrow I'll read a bit of string theory, and shake off the depressive mood left by this book
You won't stop bobbin yo head until its over.  I bought this when it first  came out and we still bump this at every party we go to and everyone is  happy to hear it, Cougnut is easily as good as biggie ever was, he just  never got the exposure that biggie did
Theres alot of rpg's out there that ppl stumble on or find with some research and this would be one of those.  By finding it, I found myself to be one happy camper when I got it and got it going.  You can play this for a very long time, or you can play this for a short amount of time, but Im positive if your into dungeon crawl types you will love this one! --- My favorite part about this particular game is not having to have a key chart sitting in front of me at all times to glance at to remind me of what key does what.  I hate games that have so many controls that you cant just PLAY them w/o memorizing so many key strokes to even move much less play. --- There is also active forums with lots of info for this game even though its not a well known game here in the USA. --- All in all I recommend this highly.  Great graphics but you wont have to have a high end rig to run it.  There is already an addition to this out, replay value is high on this one
This movie has been on my top 5 list for years.  Although the quality of the movie is poor by today's standard, it is worth it to see the transformation of this young woman.  Don't miss this movie
Once I got the hang of it it worked like a charm. I needed to mount a magnifying glass to the table so I could see for perfect alignment. If not perfectly aligned you break pins.  Now that I got the hang of it I have one pin left I keep e-maling seller to buy more pins but seller won't answer. Does anyone know where to get more pins? I would buy another unit but seller went to the bank on shipping charges
I ordered these earrings knowing they would be small.  If my ear holes had been a bit more toward the edge of my earlobe they might have fit.  These earrings are *really tiny* and do not fit me.  I need the next higher up size. These are like 3/8 inch, way small for me and also way difficult to even bend/manipulate to open the hoop
Please read Mr. Marcus C. Dunn's review because I agree with all his negative and positive points about these earrings. ---  --- In my case, I bought it as one of the many small presents for my fiancee. When I first received it today, I was really liked the "design" of the earring.  But after closer examination, I noticed that the "blue" stone was "very light blue". Good quality earring for a young teenager (9 to 14 years old) but not for the woman I'm going to spend the rest of my life with. Returning the earring and definitely learned my lesson - Jewelry has to been seen and bought with your "own" eyes and not through fancy "photoshop" website with touchup/enhanced photos
I breast fed my son for a year in 2003 with the Medela pump back then.  I trusted Medela to pick up this one for my daughter this year.  I pump once a day, so they get used, but not abused.  The model has changed some, I think it is more powerful this time.  The thing I don't like, but certainly can live with, is the motor not being attached to the breast shield.  My chest is rather large, so putting the bottles in the unit and holding the unit to my chest with one hand is not an option.  I have to hold each shield upto my chest and the motor sits in my lap.  I can't control the speed or turn the unit on/off because I don't have a free hand.  I leave the speed where I need it before and take the bottle off while it's still on and put it in the bottle holder while I turn the unit off.  I still very much like this product as it gets the job done
These bottles leak after a few months and it's hard to find new parts for the botttom of the bottle. You almost have to buy more bottles to get new parts when they leak.
I have had trouble and no satisfaction with this product. ---  --- I am downloading Grateful Dead concerts from the internet. I want to turn them into audio or data CDs. Sometimes I get a whole concert as one giant file; I want to cut that into tracks and save it. Sometimes I get a bunch of tracks; I want to combine the songs that "go into" one another (my car stereo inserts a two-second delay between tracks). One of the things I want to do is to save the files (which are mostly MP3s) in the same bit rate and format as the originals, so I loose as little "music" as possible. ---  --- The MP3 codec seems to be really buggy. Most of the combinations of bit rates and codec strategies create really wacky files: some go 5/6 normal speed, others are compressed into chopped up shortened versions of the original. When I pick a combination of settings that work, I usually lose a lot of fidelity as compared to the original (even when I'm only combinining four MP3's into one). ---  --- Try cutting one MP3 into two, and then recombining the parts into a whole. No matter what I try, there's a little click in the place where the two files are joined. This should be an easy thing, since a lot of very basic editing is cutting and splicing. ---  --- The upshot is, buying this was $40 down the drain. I'm going to have to find better software for my purposes
I Love the Mag, but sister never recieved the order I gave her as a gift!!!
I bought this hoping it would help my newborn calm down or sleep the same way a hair dryer or vacuum cleaner work so well.  This thing doesn't have a white noise sound but I thought maybe the Womb sound might work. However the volume was not even close to loud enough to compare to a hair dryer.  It's just become a toy for my older child who likes to play with the other sounds.
The product itself is good and feels safe when I use it. The assembly instructions could use some help. But I eventually figured out what the pictures meant.
This magazine is so delightful! Fantastic tutorials-great photos and wonderful info. --- I enjoy it very much and wouldn't hesitate to subscribe again. I heartily recommend it
This is the second time I have ordered these blades for my husband. He has a very heavy beard and says these are the only razor blades he's ever used that last anywhere near this long, regular blades dull almost right away (sorry he's not here or I'd ask for the details from him, I don't know how long "a long time" is) but at 50, he's tried a lot of blades! He says never buy him anything else again so I guess these are the best!!!
We purchased this DVD because we really need to work with our son on his reading and it's a great supplement to reading books.  He loves this DVD and we love the variety in it's approach.  We didn't realize until we watched it with our kids that so much of what we viewed as children really stuck with us through the years
This is an excellent gaming system containing five acrade classics, Ms. Pac Man, which plays as close to the arcade as you can get, Pole Position, which the Joystick turns as a stearing wheel, again close to acrade action, Mappy, where you are a mouse trying to get a cat on the loose in a museum (much like original mario brothers), Galaga-an updated space invaders type game with more difficult ships to hit, and finally Xevious, where you are commander of a ship blowing up attaching enemies over land and see (plays like Tiger Heli for nintendo, or other games like this).  I use this on my old call room tv with mono av jacks available, works great, passes the time with family friendly games. These games are much better than some of the new expensive games.  check this out, you will be pleasently surprised, and for around 6-12 dollars, good deal. Runs on 4 AA batteries, then plug and play
I loved the earlier Nevada Barr mysteries, with their depiction of national parks and natural dangers.  I wasn't as happy with some of her latest efforts, but still hadn't given up on her.  Now I'm not so sure.  This latest novel started off well enough although the idea of two severely traumatized girls should have been a clue as to what would follow. The idea that they were from a polygamous Mormon sect was a red herring.  Perhaps it was Barr's attempt to show us how these girls were abused even before they met evil incarnate. The scenes where Anna realizes who the real villian is and her interaction with him and the poor tortured third traumatized girl went on for over 60 pages. Each scene was more disturbing the one before it. I found myself skimming the pages and still am not sure how she resolved all the loose ends. But I have absolutely no desire to re-read the end of the book and find out.  I wish I could say that I would read another Nevada Barr novel because I so thoroughly enjoyed the first ones. But after reading this disturbing, somewhat convoluted story, I would think twice.  If I did pick up another Anna Pigeon novel, I'd make sure I had something else to read if the story took another dark turn. I would certainly not stick with it to the end.
Our entire family loved the hand held game, as a matter of fact we ended up buying 5 of them total eveyone wanted one. I would highly recommend this item to everyon
A poorly-conceived, poorly put together mess.  Don't bother
I have used this product for over a year now.  The reason I bought it was for the back up software.  Email was a secondary consideration.  Let me talk about the back up for a moment.  It is quick to download and about that easy to start using.  The set up can be done in two ways.  Either by default, or manual.  I chose the default version which covers my home folders and it automatically backs up everything to my external hard drive at a time of my choosing.  It will also set up a seperate version of a back up of vital stuff to an online storage for you that you get when you buy .mac as well.  Restoring a lost file couldn't be easier.  just click on restore and the locate the file (or files) you want to restore.  The program is set up so that everything is named exactly as you originally named it on your hard drive.  You don't have to look for your file name in a long string of code.  Just select it and click restore.  It will either put it in the exact place of your old file or in new location of your choosing.   I haven't really messed with the other features yet, but the email is spam free and has been my default email for over a year now with out any problems.  Hope you buy the service and will enjoy it as much as I have
The only outdoor BBQ thermometer that I could find with a lighted digital readout. Easy to see in the dim light outside at the BBQ. Reliable -accurate -and easy to use -at an affordable pric
I bought this CD for "Hole In The Earth", a very dynamic, driving and quasi-psychedelic rocker, and mostly got what I expected - more of the same along a continuum, sometimes pushing their envelope in either direction, as I expected.  ---  --- And then I came upon "Pink Cellphone", a rotten apple if there ever was one. This vile little stinker is as if one of the band's groupies wandered into the control room in a methamphetamine haze, defecated on the mixing board, and then described her experience, in no uncertain terms, into an answering machine. If there was ever a reason to switch from buying an artist's complete CDs to just purchasing individual tracks off of the web, this is it. Congratulations, guys, you have not only lodged a very descriptive and literally filthy image into my head, but convinced me, and I'd wager, many listeners, that our faith is ill placed with the musical choices that pop musicians make when assembling their "B" sides. To say nothing of the bad taste and lack of respect for your audience that this demonstrates.  ---  --- Someone should wash the Deftones' mouths out with a bar of soap - maybe a few bars.
In the picture it shows of this bra it looked as if it was low cut and comfortable, but it shows it in a smaller size than the one I wear, so once I opened the box I was very suprised that it was so huge and cumbersome. It could not possibly be worn with a low cut top, which is why I bought it. If you were a size 34d or above, beware
I have not yet looked at all the documents included in this software. I appreciate the tutorial nature and the pro/con examples given. Since I am not a lawyer, I am a bit nervous about making legal decisions that would need a test in court to be sure I made the correct choices. I did complete the HealthCare Directive and it compares well with others I've seen used in my state. I need to learn more about estate planning and this is going to teach me the jargon and the proper questions to ask. ---  --- My only complaint is that I declined the free delivery option and paid for delivery so I would have enough time to work with it before my parents appointment with their estate attorney.  It did not arrive in a timely manner and I was forced to purchase a download version from another vendor in order to complete forms I wanted the attorney to look at.  It is no surprize that he was more interested in drawing up his own forms for my parents and charging $1000 for a basic package. ---  --- I decided to keep the CD anyway (when it finally arrived) just in case I have a hard drive failure. 
Really it is a good game on war, buy it since it(he) is very goo
I bought these slippers after reading these reviews, thinking "they are really cute, how bad can they smell?"  Well, let me tell you on Christmas morning they lasted about 20 minutes in the living room before they were thrown outside on the porch, and they were back at the store 2 days later being returned.  The smell is beyond awful, and is absolutely unbearable.  As cute as these slippers are for your princess, do yourself a favor and get something else.  These are horrifying
I use this purely as shower gel/cleanser and absolutely love it.  The smell is great - not too overpowering and really perks me up in the morning.  It reminds me of the lemonade stands I used to have as a kid.  Easily one of my favorite Philosophy fragrances.  I also recommend "Falling in Love," and "Strawberry Daquiri."  In fact, I don't think you could go wrong with any Philosophy products! 
I'm not any expert in the computer world. But this product it is very easy to install. The range is very strong. --- I'm very hapy with this product!!!
I ordered this thinking it was a Magazine, it is more like a newspaper. It has good information, but it was not what I thought it would be. 
I'm very dissappointed with this expensive pump. Now I'm looking for another one. It's difficult to pump if you have large nipples. You have to buy extra sheild which costs extra. It's noisy. It loses suction.The milk backs up to the tubing and gets moldy.I clean the parts everyday. I have contacted Medela a few times to troubleshoot the pump and they eventually sent me another motor (great customer service). It worked for a few months and now the same problem is happening. I guess it works for some and not others. Now I'm in the hunt for another pump since I want to exclusively give my baby pure breastmilk for her first year. 
I bought the Great Outdoors Deluxe Gas Smoker for my first smoker and the first time I used it, I cooked two Pork Boston Butt's. I have never used a smoker before and I was worried about the heat fluxuating,(I think thats how you spell it),alot. Once I got the heat set(in about 20 minutes) I put the two pork butt's on and left it till the next morning. I woke up and checked the temp and it was perfect. Everyone who had some of my smoked pork thought I was a proffesional at smoking with my Great Outdoors Deluxe Gas Smoker. I am doing some beef brisket this weekend to see how it turns out. Alot of people have been saying that thier Smoker was in bad shape because of the packing from the manufacturer but the Smoker I bought from Lowe's was packed in a cardboard box with foam supporting everything and nothing was damaged or scratched on my Smoker. I would recommend this Smoker for anyone that wants a Very Good and easy to use Smoker. OH Yeah' It's also easy to clean!
After nearly two weeks, I'm still waiting for Kingston to ship out replacement ram. The ram was installed and after just one day, the ram caused several of the programs on my system to quit functioning. ---  --- After calling Kingston several times, they still have not shipped the replacement modules yet. It's been two weeks. ---  --- I would strongly consider a different brand next time. This company is not responsive.
this is a great album and a great artist with albert king theres no going wrong when you buy one of his albums. he is the king of electric-blues. you can hear all these songs in great format. just awsome playing awsome singing. its sure no wonder srv. and hendrix really loved albert king
I've worn out my previous two Char Broil Electric Smokers. I use the **** out of them, especially for smoking Salmon
After using a smaller plastic tub and a blow up tub, this one is the best!  I only wish I would've just bought this one to begin with.  My little guy is 6 months old, 24 pounds but can't sit up yet.  He still uses the side that lays him down in the water, and he loves it!  Don't waste your money on other tubs, this one is the best.  This one will grow with your child while saving water too
If you've seen one you've seen them all. Uptight guy by chance meets quirky girl, she brings him out of his shell. ---  --- Well, I bought this for like two dollars, and maybe it was worth it. I watch it like once a year. No special features on DVD worth mentioning. ---  --- Ben Affleck is getting married, he has to fly down to the south from NY for the wedding. But things keep getting in his way. Forces of Nature. Also, he keeps running into, and can't seem to get away from, some weird chick (Bullock). Are these signs? Should he stop being so uptight, and go with this free-spirited chick? Or should he be an adult and get married and accept his Vanilla lifestyle? ---  --- The acting in this movie is "meh", meaning Sandra has the same personality that she has in every movie; and Affleck sucks, as usual. The other small parts are well done, for the most part. ---  --- The script is formulaic, and the cinematography at times is interesting. It's just another rom-com where the whacky girl brings the uptight guy out of his shell. The movie opens with a stripper scene, no nudity. There is also a pot-smoking scene in this movie. There is also a scene where Affleck strips at a gay bar. Just thought I'd throw that in, in case you're considering buying this for your teen daughter or something, and that kind of thing bothers you. ---  --- You only need to buy this is you are a rom-com fanatic, or a big fan of either Affleck or Bullock. Otherwise this is completely forgettable. --- 
OK I havent read it yet, and it will take some effort to do so. The pages are yellowed, they are cut uneven(A first for me to witness!!) --- I have ordered 3 books on chinese issues, and 2 have been scams. OK, there's a lesson there somewhere - buyer beware, especially concerning chinese items!!! --- Their economic strategy revolves around/ begins with CHEAP MATERIALS! --- BUYER BEWARE
I have a videonow player and I luv it!!! There are over 100 discs!
It's a 72mm lens hood, no vigneting, works great. A must for using EF28-135 outdoors
These are great: our vegan Golden Retriever seems to *love* them (and is very healthy); the cows, pigs, & chicks are pretty-darn happy she's eating veggie-treats; the treats are organic; and Newman's donates the profits to charities!  Now that's a win-win-win-win! ---  --- I only gave them 4 stars since the bags are so small and cause a lot of packaging waste which Newman's should be well aware of (why should we have to buy 6-packs of 10-oz bags instead of 30-oz or 60-oz bags)?  When that's resolved, they're getting 5-stars from me
Xenosaga II-Jenseits von Gut und Boese came in November to Europe and was the first Xenosaga, which was released here!!! But we European players never played Xenosaga I before, so Namco released the second Xenosaga in a great "Special Box". In this box was the game itself and a Movie-DVD with nearly all Xenosaga I movies.  --- Back to topic, in my opinion Xenosaga II is a pretty game with cool movies and a battle system that makes fun. --- The music in this game was composed from Yuki Kajiura in the movies and Shinji Hosoe in the rest of the game. I think Kajiuras music is really good but Shinji Hosoe did a bad job, with his elevator music ;o) --- The graphics are okay but I couldn't see anything outstanding. --- In the end I must say, that Xenosaga II is a good RPG, even if it's not so wonderful than the first Xenosaga. That's the reason, why I imported Xenosaga I from your country ^_~  --- But at last the most PAL-players are happy, that actually (my dictionary doesn't give me the right English translation for "ueberhaupt" ;_; sorry) Xenosaga II come to Europe yet!!!! --- So I look forward to the third and last Xenosaga and hope, that this Episode will be like the first!!!! --- Many greets from Germany.....Viele Gruee aus Deutschland ^
I bought this backpack last minute for a weekend in the columbia gorge area, It worked great.  The backpack doesn't strain my back at all, the load felt very even.  And the attached rainfly came in handy once as well.  It comes with a bunch of extra attached straps to secure all the extras (tent rods, sleeping pad, rope, etc...) I am thoroughly impressed to have found a good pack for such a bargain pric
Broke first time I used it. --- When it worked it was highly inaccurate (I own a radar speed detector).  Save your money
I have had 2 different auto ramp systems prior to the rhino ramp 8000.  I had the same problem with both, sliding as I was trying to drive up on them with my car or truck or riding lawnmower.  This does not happen with the rhino ramp.  It stays in place and does not scoot any.  I recommend this ramp system
Received the ab roller and the box contained none of the hardware necessary for assembly.  5 days after emailing the company, they reply that they are unable to send the hardware and I must return it to them before they will send out a new box.  Very frustrating- I must drive 20 miles to the nearest UPS store to return it. --- Wish I had just bought the thing at Walmart
We have used QuickBooks on a PC since the 1990's.  We loved the way Inuit made accounting accessible for people without degrees in accounting.  QuickBooks for Mac is TERRIBLE in comparison.  If you plan to use the payroll features, it is unusable.  QuickBooks Mac payroll redirects you to the internet, where it is handled by PayCycle (an independent company).  Payroll is not integrated at all in the Mac (instead import/export operation). On the PC, it is part of the QuickBooks application.  We could not get job costing to work, and the tax calculations made no sense.  We were paying TONS of money to PayCycle, so fortunately the taxes were filed automatically.  We finally reverted back to QuickBooks for Windows and are MUCH happier with Intuit handling our payroll
If you're an anti-commercial radio type this tuner will probably not win you over.  If however you don't like paying a monthly charge for satellite radio and you want something more than just standard AM/FM you might like this tuner. Many stations in the top 50 cities have stations transmitting HD signals.  The quality of HD is most amazing on quiet passages in Classical music, there is no noise at all, very quiet. You do notice!  The HDT-1 is quite sensitive. It will pull in stations that other tuners won't, and I'm not even talking about the HD2 streams that the stations are starting to feature.  ---  --- Clear Channel for all the bashing people do of them is doing a great job with HD.  Their stations sound good and most of the FM's are doing HD2, a few have some interesting formats not heard on most AM/FM stations.  I hope the get even more adventurous.  ---  --- My only disappointment is you need a strong signal to get HD to lock in on AM or FM.  I don't believe that to be a fault of the tuner, it's the HD system and just like FM did I'm sure it will improve (ask someone over 50 about FM drift) .  I give it 5 stars, it's not perfect but for the price it's very good and for a first generation product I don't think it could be better than this
One of the "must see" Christmas movies.  A family oriented movie that will rekindle the Christmas spirit in everyone.  We have this on VCR tape and have watched it so much that we purchased the DVD version. Enjoy
These are hands down my favorite pair of jeans. I'm 5'5" and they are just the right length to wear with tennis shoes and midheight heels.  The stretch fabric hugs in all the right places, and the cut is slimming. 
I wasn't expecting much based on the price, so I was pleasantly surprised when I received my order. The tote is a nice size, made of relatively heavy fabric and seems to be well-sewn. I've paid a lot more for a lot less. This was a great buy
It is basically a short review of the great book written by Zahn.  I recommend the novel and this as a refresher for later times
I purchased this Bible study set to use with my Palm LifeDrive.  It works perfectly on this device.  Truly, it is exactly what I wanted.   ---  --- It should be noted that the NIV Bible - and the other translations in the set - obscure God's name (YHWH).  This makes it easy for mainstream nominal Christians to attribute Jesus as being the almighty God - instead of being simply the only begotten son of the almighty God. ---  --- But the translations are otherwise rather good - and the tools offered in this software set make it well worth the money.  After all, God is a judge of hearts and intentions rather than the technical errors of man trying to understand Him.  Jesus preached love of even our enemies rather than legalistic jargon. ---  --- It would have been great if the set included an interlinear (word for word translation) of both Old and New Testaments.  That would have been a very great addition; but it would have doubled the cost.  If such becomes available I will gladly pay the price
Everyone in my family (from 3 to 64 years old) loves these organic cookies.  I purchased these cookies at several local stores before I discovered that Amazon had them. I sent a package to my grandson who is in the Army in Iraq and he raved about them.  Newman's has another big winner!
With no mode settings(repeat, shuffle, etc) or shock protection, this cd player is pretty undesirable, but if you're just looking for something to hold you over then this'll do. It has all the basic features of a cd player of course and it works alright. It could be with just mine, but every pair of headphones, new and old, that I use with it, the left begins to malfunction although when using those same headphones in another cd player or speakers, they work fine. Like I said, if you just want a temporary thing then I guess this is good for you
This is very BAD---doesnot work and really interfers with other programs. Almost impossible to remove it.
I had a motorola H300 before... and this is leaps and bounds better.  --- The sound quality in both units are great but I'm impressed by the weight of this LG unit. It is like comparing stones to feathers (a bit exagerated but you get the point...).  --- This LG unit also has a protruding ear bud, which sits snuggly in my ear. The Motorola unit didn't... which often dangled and swayed like the last apple on a tree right before it falls. That caused discomfort and I had to tilt my head a bit to keep the unit against my ear. With the new LG, I no longer have to look like I have a stiff neck while I'm driving
As i frantically searched for my movie the Postman, I decided to order some tuscan whole milk. As i serched threw the frist 100 binders i could not find it. Then i heard the knocking on my door, I rushed to find the postman. I opened the box and grabbed the gallon of whole milky goodness. i opened it to hear the popping of freshness. I procedded to drink the whole gallon. Soon after I finished the milk I was blessed with sight beyond sight. I found my movie in the 256 binder, on page 75 in the lower left hand corner. I seen it so brillantly and put it in the dvd player. Unfortantllly I had to wait until my sight was returned to normal. I waited for a total of three months and then I was able to watch my movie. Thank you Tuscan Milk
Alec Baldwin is tied with John Goodman for the second highest appearing host of all time.  So it's only natural that he now has a best of DVD.  This is not the best SNL DVD, but it is still a VERY good one.  If you already have the best of Dana Carvey, Mike Myers, Steve Martin, and Tom Hanks... get this one next.  This DVD has a couple of not-so-good skits, but it makes up for every one.  There are a lot of hilarious skits on the DVD.  I'm not going to list them, but just trust me.  Anyone who gives this less than four stars is OUT OF THEIR MIND.  When I first saw that the Best of Alec Baldwin was out I didn;t have to give it a second thought.  It was at the top of my list, and it should be at the top of yours too. 
this movie far exceeds its later edition. this edition is disturbing, but excellent. the violence, the gore, everything is heart-pounding
I had an S5000 but it dropped it and broke. So I decided to buy this model since I loved the S5000 so much. They took away so many of the great options and quality that the S5000 had...so now I just use a small Fuji pocket digital camera and this one sits on the shelf. It is very blurry in low light and has very little shake control. I would suggest going with the S5000 even with lower Megapixels it is much better quality
I bought this from a different vendor and started working out with it immediately, interspersing it with my usual cardio workouts.  I usually lift weights, have no prior injuries, and consider myself in pretty good shape as well as pretty used to working out and using proper form (I played a college sport, etc.).  After a couple days of using this product my neck and shoulders started spasming and were so stiff that I could barely move them regularly.  It was clearly not from the amount of weight since i am used to using much heavier (free weights included).  Perhaps I was doing the exercises incorrectly, but that seems like a real risk with a video like this. 
I just got this grill a couple of days ago and I am psyched!  ---  --- I've always been a bit of a charcoal snob, but I wanted to expand my repertoire beyond just the Weber charcoal grill and the Bradley smoker I have.  ---  --- It was a snap to put together and it only took me about 20-25 minutes. I was able to lift it onto the legs in step 3 by myself without a problem; you just need to be careful.  ---  --- I did a ton of research and opted for the Weber mostly because of my experience with their quality products and I didn't want to chance it with a semi-unknown brand from Home Depot. I chose the Genesis Gold as I don't necessarily like all the stainless steel framing in the genesis platinum line, but I wanted the stainless steel grates and flavorizer bars that the genesis silver doesn't have. Also, I wanted the B as opposed to the C as I don't really use the side burner. ---  --- It lights quickly and evenly and it does heat up in a jiffy; I do like the convenience of gas. I've also got a smoker box for the grill to add the smoke that I like to compensate for the lack of charcoal flavor. However, for low and slow true barbecue, I'll stick with my Bradley smoker as the water vapor from the propane as it burns doesn't allow proper penetration of the smoke into the meat.  ---  --- This grill rocks.
You know, after REALLY trying to like this album, I must agree with K Johnson. Oftentimes a really good album sounds horrible (or just plain plain) upon one or three spins, so when this album didn't move me the first time, I decided to hang back and try again in a few days. Then again. And again. And one more time. Usually after three or four COMPLETE spins (which was like work, with this one)the jems will work there way to the surface. Sufjian Stevens was like that. So was Z by My Morning Jacket. But the problem was that I really wanted to like this one. All the reviews I read were hyping this as the album of the decade, and I wanted them to be right. --- Unfortunately, none of them were right. It is a plodding, lifeless album wanting desperately to be 'hip' and failing miserably, to the point of being embarassing almost. Like your 40 something hipster college prof with a graying ponytail (who will LOVE this, by the way), it will be pointless to argue with those who like this album. I have to say that it is obvious these guys put a lot of work into this, and they do have talent; it just doesn't get me there. I hope they can live up to the hype next time. I truly do..
I got my Grill to Go Advantage just recently and have been very pleased so far.  The makers of the Grill 2 Go appear to have heard some of the criticisms of earlier models and taken that into consideration with this grill.  The open flame cooking is preferable to the previous models, it is still easy to transport, and it has made tailgating with friends before watching my Tarheels play basketball a lot of fun.  I completely disagree with the other reviewer who seems to be reviewing the wrong product since this grill does not use a non-stick cooking surface for the cooking area
I chose this bottle system for my son after reading so many great reviews, and even bought one and ran it through the dishwasher to test for leaks...no leaks...They worked well, UNTIL recently.  My son is 4 months old and they all LEAK. Constantly. I fill one up to put it in the diaper bag and within a half hour it's empty. They aren't very durable, the plastic on the rings is actually breaking off and now I'm going through the struggle of trying to find a new bottle system that my son will take (I hate the liners)...And they never did reduce the amount of air in the bottle at all.  Do not buy these bottles unless you want to buy a completely new system in 4 months
The Tubbly Bath Dispenser fit our spout just fine, but minutes later it would work itself off.  We tried everything to get it to work with no luck.  Fortunately, the company that sells it agreed to let us return it weeks later without a receipt or packaging.  Don't even try it...it's not worth it!  Look for something else.  There are other faucet covers out there
I have been using this shaver for 2 weeks now and have not had any problems with it. It is easy to use and clean I have only had to charge it once so far. Even though this is my first electric shaver, it is a good deal for the money. It doesn't shave as close as a razor but it's close. I would recommend it or give it as a gift. 
We replaced an old, larger and broken Sunbeam "Bug Snapper" with this unit.  This is lighter and easier to handle.  We're in Southern Arizona, so our bug season is just starting.  The unit works great, but upon encountering a really big moth it sizzles for as long as ten seconds . . . kind of gruesome.  If you're dealing with night-flying insects this is the solution
This book is among seminal works on system safety and safety engineering and should be read by anyone who is entering the field.  One may not necessarily agree with Prof. Leveson's views (e.g. her often unfair and unjustified dismissal of european approaches to safety engineering) but her views in the field are simply too important and influential to be ignored! --- The book is a good "bed time reading" that gives an overview of the field, major problems and introduction to some major approaches.  It is however not a handbook per se - you will not understand any particular method sufficiently to apply it. --- Overall, very good introductory text with a good coverage and a very easy and clear language
i wouldn't know if this was a good magazine, i have yet to receive it, after waiting three months.  it is cheaper to order through food and wine website anyway
just what it says: all white meat, individually sized, portable, and easy to prepare... perfect alternative for tuna sala
The scale is already broken.  It just reads "Lo" when you step on it, and I just got it a couple of weeks ago.  It worked for about a week and a half
If you like Thai cooking, you will want to buy this tree. 
I've had this camera for 2 years and I am glad that it broke so I can (in good conscious) buy a new camera. It is so slow that it is impossible to catch anything but the back of my kids heads as they run away because they got tired of saying "Cheese". I always thought the battery life was sufficient, and that the quality of the images was fine, but I hardly got good shots because of how slow the camera was. I'd put the shoot button and it would take about 2 seconds before the camera would click. I actually sent it back to the manufacturer thinking there was something wrong with it, but they said it was functioning normally. --- It was probably the most disappointing $200 purchase I've made
I ordered one and had it arrive totally broken. Amazon sent a replacement. That too was defective. Save your time/money and buy another, maybe in person. I'm not convinced that hair dryers survive shipping. ---  --- (Amazon is giving me a refund including shipping, so there's not a problem there.
I love my coffee machine but I normally do not buy t-discs from Gevalia due to price.  But found this on Amazon = Wow 2 for 1!  --- Price is great, even when you add in any cost for shipping etc.  Still beats "Bead Bath & Beyond" with a coupon!  Service and delivery were excellent
I have been using Cindy Crawfords tapes since 1993. I used shape your body while I was pregnant 10 years ago ( Don't be horrified )  living in the tropics and with a few adjustments I did that workout in the pool minus the situps combined with walking. I had my first birth naturally and within 3 Hours and had the best legs ever. ---  --- My first impression of Cindy was that she is honest. She does not pretend to be the expert and she really has a Genunie interest in exercising this shines throught on the DVDs.  I have tried many other celebrity videos and you just don't feel comfortable with them. She does not try to exercise and be perfect at the same time. Really  she is there just to help and with alot of sympathy.You cannot help but like her. ---  --- New Dimension is fantastic I have started doing the 10min workout everyday. You do not have to do alot to get results just target the right areas. People can workout for an hour and not get the same results. --- New Dimension is not just a post pregnancy DVD . This is great for women over 35 that want to control their pelvic muscles the other two workouts on the DVD are more than you will ever need to work all your body . I still mix it up with first two DVDs --- I have just purchased the set of three DVds again to replace worn out copies . Cindy looks like she will be in my lounge room for a very long time. --- Please enjoy !!!!!!
"Hey kids, fire up the XBOX and lets watch this movie!"  ---  --- That is what is heard through households that own an XBOX but for some reason or another they are still in the 90's and don't already have a DVD player.  ---  --- Like my title suggests, if you already have a DVD player, this is a waste of money. The only reason I purchased one is because my DVD player had problems playing some DVD-R's that I got from a friend. I had some money to burn so I just wanted to see if the XBOX DVD kit could play it to determine if the DVD was a bad burn or was it just my DVD player. I found that the XBOX was able to play the DVD-R's in question with no problem. However, aside from those two DVD-R's, all of the DVD's I own are bought from retail stores, so I really have no need to play DVD-R's, and my DVD player plays normal discs perfectly.  ---  --- With that being said, I only used XBOX's DVD playback kit once to watch the DVD-R's I had problems with. Because of the content of these burned "movies", there is really no need to watch them again....... However if push comes to shove I can always use one of my PC's or Mac to watch the burned DVD; no need to use my XBOX for that. I meant to return the DVD kit the next day, but never got around to it.  ---  --- The XBOX's DVD player is a good feature, but the fact that Microsoft charges you to use the feature makes it not worth the money.....unless of course you don't have a DVD player at all.
These peanut butter balls not only taste great but they are good for you.  My daughter has celiac disease so foods like these are really blessings in our life.  I have eaten these when I did not have time for lunch.  They are filling and energizing and taste delicious.  You can't ask for more than that!
Ok so Claud was never a great actor and this was not his best work, Yes the "martial arts" are weak at best, but I still own this movie and watch it just to see Raul Julia go over the top. ---  --- Why do they still call me a warlord? And mad? All I want to do is to create the perfect genetic soldier. Not for power, not for evil, but for good. Carlos Blanka will be the first of thousands. They will march out of my laboratory and crush every adversary, every creed, every nation! Until the world is in the loving grip of the Pax Bisonica. And peace will reign and all humanity will bow to me in humble gratitude.
The computer that I bought June 2006 came with Nero 6 OEM version.  It has worked very well.  I finally got around to clicking on the upgrade icon and ordered what I thought would be a serial number to unlock some features.  It turns out that is not available, and I have bought the Nero 7 Ultra version, which required a 195 MB download. Having dialup, I was not pleased.  I asked for my money back.  No response.  I faxed BBB complaint with copies to Nero offices in California and Germany. The office in Germany responded with email that they do not do refunds. Los Angeles BBB has been unresponsive.  --- I finally got the download from a computer with broadband. I uninstalled Nero 6 and set restore point.  I installed Nero 7.  It worked!  But it was agonizingly slow.  I don't mean the CD or DVD writing per se was slow. When I eventually got it going that gave me the full speed of my hardware. However navigating from each click to response felt like it was in a 486 and not an Athlon 64.  I think other programs were also rendered more sluggish in opening files. --- I uninstalled Nero 7, and just to be safe I then used restore point from before I installed it. I reinstalled Nero 6. What a relief!  There may be some fancy features Nero 6 OEM lacks, but it's worth it to have the computer working at reasonable speed. If I want to rip a music track to a .wav file (a feature lacking in the OEM version), it's easier to reboot to linux and run K3b than put up with sluggish Nero 7 Ultra to do it. ---  --- A product and company gone bad; Nero 7 is definitely not recommended
You can tell your life is REALLY pathetic when ghosts have to show you how to live. ---  --- But that is what happens to Cosmo Topper, in the charming "Topper" and its equally charming sequel "Topper Returns."  It's basically your typical screwball comedy (complete with Cary Grant), but with an injection of supernatural pranking and murder mystery. In other words, it's loads of fun. ---  --- George and Marion Kirby (Cary Grant, Constance Bennett) love fun, partying until clubs kick them out, and generally not taking life seriously. So it's a shock to them when they die in a car accident, and linger on as ghosts. Apparently they have not done any good deeds to go to the Great Beyond. ---  --- So when George's boss, Cosmo Topper (Roland Young), crashes his new car in the same spot, the Kirbys take him under their wing. Poor Cosmo is stodgy and timid, with a domineering wife who schedules his day down to the minute. So it's up to the Kirbys to show the poor man how to live life and have fun, but their good deed rapidly gets away from them... ---  --- And most sequels stink, but goofy murder mystery "Topper Returns" is just as funny as the first movie. Instead of a ghostly screwball, this time it's a spoof of "haunted house" stories, with a nod to Hitchcock's "Rebecca." ---  --- Ann Carrington (Carole Landis) is returning to her ancestral home and inheritance, with cheeky pal Gail (Joan Blondell) in tow. But after the girls switch bedrooms, someone murders Gail. Confused, she drifts over to the house of Cosmo Topper (Roland Young), whose car she hijacked earlier in the day. ---  --- Gail blackmails Topper into helping her discover who murdered her, and who is trying to kill Ann. Now the unfortunate Topper must somehow solve the mystery, despite a small army of creepy servants, a house full of secret passages and vicious seals, and his upset wife searching high and low for him... ---  --- Based on Thorne Smith's novels, "Topper" and "Topper Returns" even had a spinoff TV series, which was nowhere near as good as the movies. And those movies are charming and still fresh, especially if you like to see a twist on the usual ghost stories. ---  --- But it's the little touches that make this movie hilarious; for example, there's George laughing on a chandelier, and Gail chugging champagne when she discovers her own dead body. Not to mention that vicious seal. The comedy becomes more obvious and spoofy in the second film, but no less entertaining.  ---  --- But at the same time, these movies are graced by tender moments between George and Marion, and a truly exquisite scene where Gail's ghost wanders out the window into the sky. And I'm still not sure how that invisible-person-under-the-covers shot was done, especially with the primitive special effects of the 1940s.  ---  --- Roland Young is the star of the piece -- his Topper is timid, halting, and has his day scheduled down to the minute. Not a single spark of sponteneity. Grant comes across like a trickster god, and has wonderful chemistry with Bennett. And Blondell is simply charming as a resourcefully cheeky ghost girl. ---  --- "Topper" and "Topper Returns" are decades old, but are perfect examples of Hollywood classics. Charming, chipper and hilarious
I gave my father-in-law a couple ideas for my son's (1 year old) Christmas gift and this was one of the items. Boy do I regret giving him this as an idea. It is a cheaply constructed toy. The bus's hood doesn't even work correctly. The toy does not do much of interest and it constantly makes this annoying noise! The toy held my son's attention for less than 5 minutes. My suggestion to anyone considering this toy is there are many more worthwhile toys on the market- skip this one
...this is nothing like the Spirograph I grew up playing with.  As everyone else mentioned, the gears are much too thin and slip constantly.  My 6 year old son was completely frustrated after wrestling with the design flaws.  Don't waste your money!
I bought this to change my watch battery. Tools broke after using it once. Worthless. Complete waste of money on this cheap toolkit
Janet Browne's far-reaching biography misses little in bringing us the life of the 19th Century's most controversial biologist/geologist.  The first volume of a two-volume set, "Voyaging", begins (as you would expect) with his youth in the English town of Shrewsbury under his father's care.  We meet his father - a Doctor and businessman, his brother - intelligent but unfocused, and his late grandfather Erasmus Darwin who was well known at the time for his eccentric and agnostic views.   ---  --- From his early days, Browne depicts a Darwin struggling to find himself, first as a medical student in Edinburgh, then as a student of theology in Cambridge.  Though we know better what Darwin is to be, Browne's portrait of him manages to evoke the doubt that he must have felt when faced with adequate but uninspiring career options. ---  --- But the story often returns to Darwin's love of the outdoors and of biology - a theme which underpins all of his early feints and mis-steps at life.  He is seen as a frequent hunter, and an avid collector and cataloguer of insects and beetles.  Despite this, and despite the benefit of hindsight, at times I felt some tension - finding myself unconsciously wishing to offer advice to this young man who seems adrift and unaware of the great role that history was preparing him for.   ---  --- We finally catch a glimpse of that future as he fortuitously receives an offer to travel aboard The Beagle, a vessel bound for South America on a surveying mission.  I won't spoil the rest, other than to say that Browne does an excellent job of building Darwin, showing in detail each moment of discovery upon which the next is laid, capturing his excitement about the natural world as he slowly sheds his amateur standing and gains confidence - finally attaining acknowledged scientific stature.  And yet even then, Darwin holds his boldest work out of sight of the world, privately developing the theory of natural selection out of sight of a straightjacketed Victorian society. ---  --- In tenor, it's clear that Browne, a Professor in the History of Biology greatly respects her subject.  But she does not allow him to pass through her pen unscathed.  Darwin was a man of his times and of a certain station, and held certain prejudices that the author doesn't hesitate to point out - such as his not wholly humanitarian attitudes about slavery.  She also reveals what some may find Darwin's less endearing traits such as his anti-social tendencies and his lack of any real passion for any subject but science (When approaching the subject of marriage, Darwin's priority on research causes him to discard several eligible but too learned women who, he feared, might place demands on his time).   ---  --- She does seem to soft-pedal Darwin's poor treatment of his companions on The Beagle, many of whom contributed significantly to his efforts on that seminal voyage, and whose contributions went largely uncredited and unrecognized.  (For those curious, this theme is well-explored in Robert Wright's "The Moral Animal") ---  --- Also, it was difficult for me to follow the various people who pass through his life and their relationship to him, more my failing than the author's I think, as she provides ample details on the many individuals who made an impact on Darwin's life.  If you do decide to read it, it might be helpful to keep a pen and paper handy for jotting down a few notes (although the author does append a fairly extensive family tree at the front of the book). ---  --- Certainly, the book is well worth reading for anyone with more than a passing interest in exactly how the theory of evolution (and the legend of Charles Darwin) was born.  I've read few biographies better
My little boy who is 8 years old loves this movie.  He goes around acting like the characters from the movie!  He really likes Harold and keeps watching the movie over and over again hoping for a different ending.  He is also convinced that they should make a Midnight Madness 2 and let Harold win the next time!  This is a great movie, with a young Michael J. Fox in it, and has no sex or violence and is a very kid friendly movie
 --- I purchased two Aquis Microfiber, Waffle, White (19 x 39 inches) Towels.  Although --- they are quite expensive, the positive reviews made them sound great.  Well, they --- are not.  The towels are quite thin, and do not rub/slide well on the skin.   They give --- the feeling of having a rubbery coating of some kind which makes them wad up when --- you rub your skin. --- They are the same thickness as a dish towel, so we are using them to blot the dishes --- when they come out of the dishwasher. --- Save your money on this one!
I bought this for my mother...she loves it! Its easy for her to use and the screen is large enough for her to view.  The print quality is excellent.  I got more (merchandise and quality) with this HP brand than I would had with any other brand.  The price was excellent too.  Good job Hewlett Packard for making me a "smart" person
We haven't had any problems cleaning this chair--occasionally we need to use the crevice tool on the vacuum, but that is simple enough.  Most of the time, we simple take a wet paper towel or wet wipe and run it around the seat sides.  (We'd do that with any high chair.) The tray doesn't fit in our dishwasher, but that too has been easy to clean in the sink.   ---  --- We love the neutral and plain color of the oatmeal vinyl.  Our daughter is very happy in her chair.  She is only 16 months, but very big for her age she has no problems fitting in this seat at all.   ---  --- Our only complaint is that we have to push the tray release handle in when we put the tray on in order to lock it into place or else our daughter can push the tray almost out.  that may be a defect on ours rather than a design flaw--we just live with it since it isn't that big a deal. 
I was a little hesitent to make a big order for so much tea, not knowing if I would like it.  So I went to a local supermarket and bought a tin there so I might give it a taste test.  This is quite a good green tea.  Other than buying generic green teabags, I usually buy a Bancha tea. This tea is not as grassy, more bold with a slight smokey taste and more of a kickiness to it. --- The cannisters are nice and their is an inside foil liner to keep the tea fresh.  The only thing to be aware is that this is a lot of tea, altogether 21 ounces divided into six separate cannisters. Unless you really love this tea, plan on making some gifts
I had to return it immediately when I opened the box.  On the picture it looks more blue than purple
Great smell. Worth the cost. Cleans great. I have used this laundry soap for quite some time now and happy.
Before you buy, be sure to check where the pen was made. I have a number of older Cross pens that say "USA" near the top, and they are great pens. However, I have bought three different ones in the past few years that do not indicate where they were made, and they are of inferior quality. The top and bottom halves are loose, and have to be carefully manipulated to come together without a gap. The first one I got, I sent it back to Cross for warranty repair under their "lifetime guarantee," only to receive it back unchanged telling me that it was just fine - and a "handling fee" attached. ---  --- I was willing to believe it was simply an anomaly, one bad pen. So later on when some new colors came out, I bought two more - only to see that they have the same quality defect. ---  --- My advice: if you want a good Cross pen, go to the secondhand store and buy one that was made in USA. They aren't making them the same anymore.
This movie showed what an amazing dancer Gene Kelly was. This is one movie I recommened for anyone who loves the world of dance, thinks Gene Kelly is Hot (lol) or if you love musical theater.
I am the leader of a team called POINT 0 I got this gun about a week ago it rocks my socks. It shoots about 300fps or maybe a little more. The scope is ok and the laser pointing thing isnt to hot but it gives you an estamite at night. It holds 21 pellets and doesnt go out very fast the cocking thing is at the top. But do not use this in a war with automatics you wont compare unless your sniping. I am the leader of point 0 and this gun rocks
i dont agree with the previous reviewer at all. my kids love everything in this book and if i find enough time i want to make every single toy. they are not scary looking at all. if you like knitted babes by claire garland, you ll love this one.  ---  --- there are 5 themes in this book:  --- enchanted land: Princess and castle  --- fairy dream: fairy and baby, flower pillow, unicorn --- wild trail: cowboy and mustang --- set to sea: pirate and ratty, dinghy --- magical waterworld: Mermaid, fish, seahorse and crab, dolphin ---  --- there are also pages on knitting, crochet and stitching basics.  --- this is probably not a book for a beginner, but if have some experience you ll want to get your needles, hooks and yarn and just get going.  --- i can only recommend this one. 5 stars!!!
I ordered this soup along with a bunch of others on my goldbox special a few weeks ago. The soup comes in individually packaged microwavable cups that are easy to take to work or school with you. Upon microwaving, the soup flavor was very good but the dehydrated items inside (particularly the noodles and the beans) were hard and crunchy. After letting the dehydrated items soak for a few minutes, I tried it and it was perfect. ---  --- Very good flavor, but it has a very strong garlic component to the flavor, maybe a little too strong. I would recommend further diluting the soup down which would entail emptying the contents into a larger bowl for heating, defeating the point of the microwavable cups. ---  --- I would purchase this soup again if it was offered at the Goldbox price of nine bucks for the 12 pack. But at the price currently offered, I'm not certain I would go for it again. Nevertheless, the flavor is good and if you like strong flavor with the convenience of the individually packaged cups, it might be worth a shot ordering it one time to see if you love it
Unreliable pile of 'you-know-what'.  Worked fine for about 2 months then refused to power up.  Fresh batteries, no go.  Called customer "service".  Outsourced call center to India; rep followed generic script telling me to: 1) use lithium-ion batteries, and 2) press "power + NAV" simultaneously.  As suspected, bogus advice.  Fresh batteries metered out to 1.62 volts each / 4.84 volts total.  Yes, I tried lithium-ion batteries anyway.  Still no-go.  Am still waiting for Magellan/Thales to respond.  Am still owner of unreliable GPS.  Still have about $400 invested in unit plus software and maps.  Still kicking myself for buying a Magellan product.  Don't do it.  Really -- don't do it
My kids have tried I think all the gluten/wheat free ones and by far this is their favorite.  They stay hard in milk and I, an adult, even like them
I liked this game. I mean Final Fantasy VII is still the god final fantasy game but this was ok
     --- I emailed Skycaddie "contact us" the day after I bought a SG4 to ask for help.  ---  --- I have received no response in 3 weeks. ---  --- I played today with it for the first time.  ---  --- A guy I was playing with today also had a SG4.  ---  --- Neither of us could get a distance reading despite the indicator saying we had a strong GPS signal.  ---  --- All we got was "999" or complete blanks. ---  --- He has played with it four times and said it worked ok twice and didn't work twice. ---  --- It looks GREAT on TV. It is a real pity that my unit didn't work today. ---  --- I plan on returning it this week
I'm not sure why this magazine is so highly rated. Sure it's an O.K. magazine, if you like immersing yourself in hype, marketing-speak and incredibly superficial language. Admittedly the pictures are pretty and as an obsessed mountain biker i can say we like bike porn. I just cannot read any of the articles. Chock full of over-the-top adjectives and 'xtreme' language. I don't trust a magazine that calls every new incremental advancement in biking technology 'revolutionary' or 'amazing' or any number of disgustingly inappropriate modifiers. They ceaselessly use vapid 'technical' jargon made up to sound high-minded and high-tech, but is nothing more than marketing spew. ---  --- The tech advice column is full of suspicious letters that have the stench of stealth advertising. If there's one thing that's well thought-out about this magazine, it's how best to bombard the reader with sales pitches, half-truths and hype. ---  --- In short, this magazine is blatant industry propaganda. My first advice: don't buy it. If you do buy it (for the love of god) don't take anything between those covers seriously.
Excellent Watch (Eco-Drive) I would spend the extra hundred and purchase the titanium
Great and accurate.  It is a pleasure to use. ---  --- Best monitor available
This is an excellent, general purpose microphone at a reasonable price.  I'm a classically trained vocalist, and I use the SM58 for rehearsal and "scratch" recordings.  It delivers clear, true, and warm sound under all standard conditions and requires essentially no fine tuning or signal processing.  I still prefer the crisp detail of a condenser microphone for formal demo recordings (my favorite is the Studio Projects C1), but it's hard to beat the simplicity and reliability of the SM58 for everyday use
I was not able to get the original intercooler to work on my system. I sent it back and got another one. The second intercooler did not work either. It makes a nice paperweight!
I've had these chairs for about a week (I bought two) and they look fabulous on my front porch. They are comfortable too. ---  --- My expectations were exceeded. ---  --- Like another reviewer, I too searched for Adirondack chairs and --- found the prices to be ridiculously high. This chair and ottoman --- for $84.99 ($10 shipping) is a steal!! ---  --- The quality and construction seem to far outweigh the price. ---  --- I only gave 4 stars because I can't comment on the durability and maintenance after only a week. Strathwood recommends Teak Oil a couple of times a year. ---  --- I also purchased the 30" folding table to place in between the chairs - what a set !!! ---  --- If you're thinking about this chair, don't hesitate, you will not be disappointed !   ---  ---  --- 
I haven't been able to find this product in my local grocery stores, when I found it online through Amazon I was delighted. I ordered 10 packages, they are all gone, I love them, especially to dunk in my morning coffee. If you haven't ever tried them, do so, you will love them
These beans were really fresh and lower cost than other suppliers.  The beans were shipped free and promptly
The Still Life bath bomb contains pretty sunflower petals that make this a summery bath experience. To be truthful, after putting this in the bath I walked away and came back into the room, wondering who was eating Fruit Loops! That is the scent of this "fun to take a bath before breakfast" experience.  ---  --- The fresh scent of Lemon and Sweet Wild Orange mingles with Bergamot and Gardenia extract. The result of this bath is a refreshing - I can face the day feeling. If you want to enhance the experience, try the Happy Hippy shower gel with grapefruit. The I Love Juicy Shampoo and Veganese Conditioner also complete the citrus experience.  ---  --- If you think the petals in this bath bombs are fun (the ones in my bath slipped right down the drain), wait until you try the Big Blue experience with seaweed. It does take an adventurous spirit to try some of these items, but as an official LUSH addict, I tend to dive into the experiences with abandon. You may also love Golden Slumbers (lavender and Neroli), Sex Bomb (Jasmine, Ylang Ylang, Clary Sage), Romance In A Stone (Wild Orange, Mandarin & Tangarine).  ---  --- Onward to try Tisty Toasty which I hear is a bit of a  --- love spell style bath with rose petals.   ---  --- ~The Rebecca Review 
I bought this from ioniczone themselves. IT does not work. --- I kept it on for an entire month, the filter was never dirty at all. --- Also, this unit is extremely small, the pic is rather misleading ---  --- I was however able to return the unit to the office in NV, had to make 2 phone calls and the person was very polite. ---  --- I went on to buy one from IonicPro,and what a difference it was, filters requires cleaning every 10 days or so and it was really dirty.
This wallet is so big for passport and don`t fit my documents from Brazil. --- Maybe is good for another country`s document
Great flavor and aroma.  An excellent choice for an evening coffee break
These cheddar bunnies are now a favorite in our house.  Better tasting and cuter than goldfish crackers, these are a good snack to give to your kids, or eat yourself.  I was very pleased with this purchase
I purchased this item (not from Amazon) and my child loved it! The puppet provides hours of entertainment and the music is great, not the usual 'kid-drivel' that usually is part of any kid item.  Some HBB's come with contemporary music and I will be picking up one of those soon.  Highly recommended
I've had excellent luck with Tweezerman products in the past, but the quality of this blackhead remover was second-rate.  The item consists of a hollow metal tube with two screw-in attachments. ---  --- Neither attachments really work.  The threading of both seems to be flawed.  And to use it as intended would mean to press an unstable attachment against your face; no thanks! ---  --- My e-mailed request for re-threading or replacement to Tweezerman went unanswered.  This purchase was an expensive mistake
way to small of a cushion. had to purchase another one from a local store
I  bought this swing for our first child specially because it has many features.....overall I am happy with it and our son seems to enjoy it....but few things I wish it had is ....one that the seat could be reclined and two is that the toys made some kind of noise to get attention.Overall for the price it is good
The stars may be really nice, but the package I received looked already open. The 3 sheets with stickers appeared as if someone soaked them in water and the package was missing the putty to stick up the bigger plastic stars.
Do not order this item! I ordered and returned this item FOUR times due to cracked pieces. Storkcraft either has very poor quality control or an inability to provide adequate packing to avoid shipping damage. I refuse to reorder a fifth time so now my nursery will have to have mismatched furniture. What a disaster and diappointment
Absolute must have for a golfer!! Awesome gift!! Grips are actual golf club grips, not cheap imitation. The golf ball corn on the cob skewrs are a bonus!! The bag and the cover make this set a conversation item not an eye sore.
My daughter love these skates so much that she did not want to take them off
One warning for users with over head lights.  The 6000 keyboard that has tranparent (light gray) keys is very hard to read if the lighting is not quite right.  I have a light directly above my desk  and the reflected glare off the keys makes all the letters and numbers disappear.  Go for a black key or similar model
This is the worst magazine I have ever subscribed too.  I hated it so much after the first issue that when new ones came, I thru it right in the trash.  Here why: ---  --- 1- Ad after ad for dietary supplements (like dexatrim and stacker) which i think cheapins the creditablity of the magazine b/c true health doesnt come from a bottle. ---  --- 2- Many pics of overly built up women (think fitness competitions)...not something the average women can aspire too...and too me, is nasty looking. ---  --- 3-The information that was in it is general information that anyone with common sense already know! ---  --- My advice to you, AVOID THIS MAGAZINE, unless you like body building or like looking at body builders
It is exactly what I was looking for. I had no problems ordering or receiving it. I got to my house quickly. Nothing is wrong with it
This is one of the funniest movies i have ever seen a must see so bad it is funn
I highly recommend purchasing these shells even before the baby is born...if you plan on breastfeeding. I was very sore in the first few weeks. The shells allowed me to apply lanolin cream on my nipples and let them air out and heal in between feedings. I did only use them until my nipples were no longer sore which mentioned before was only a few weeks. But they got me through those weeks when I don't know if I'd have made it otherwise! They were a wonderful product for me
Horrible. The trampoline came in with 3 out of the 6 legs missing. This is the second product form Stamina that came in damaged. I would NOT recomend to anyone.
I bought a new state-of-the-art computer in February that came preloaded with Windows Vista. I was initially excited to get a computer that was running the newest operating system, and I hoped it would mean that my computer would have a much longer effective life. I have been nothing but disappointed since receiving this machine, especially knowing that had I called Dell, they would have installed XP instead. ---  --- PROs: --- -Better security (it prompts me & allows me to stop some of the annoying "automatic" programs that software makers sneak onto your system) --- -Better appearance (this is strictly cosmetic, and I'd rather stare at an ugly screen that worked rather than a pretty, useless one) ---  --- CONs: --- -FREEZING: I use this computer 2-3 hours a day and I can expect 1-2 freezes/day. Restarting often fails, and I have to cut the power and restart again. --- -DISPLAY PROBLEMS: although the cosmetics of the program were better, Vista can't display anything right. I tried updating the display driver which caused a major crash after restarting. I had to boot in safe mode and rollback the driver to get my computer back. Apparently, the newest display drivers are incompatible with Vista. --- -INCOMPATIBILITY: Entirely too many programs are incompatible with Vista, including some fairly big ones (lots of Adobe software, iPods, display drivers, etc.) I know Vista is new, and these software companies are slow to adapt, but does it really make sense for an operating system like Vista to render virtually all of my other software obsolete? Why can't Vista play nicely with the other kids? --- -ITS SLOW!!!-- Part of the reason I bought a new, state-of-the-art computer was to replace my old laptop (which still runs OK, but has become a little buggy & sluggish in the past 4 years). Although this computer is light years ahead of the old one, it actually runs EVEN SLOWER than my old laptop. Technical support has largely attributed this to the demands of Vista. ---  --- BOTTOM LINE: --- 1. IF YOU ARE NOT GOOD WITH COMPUTERS, AVOID VISTA LIKE THE PLAGUE --- 2. VISTA IS A RIP-OFF. Save your money and keep/get XP-- I'm probably going to return my computer and make the manufacturer install XP so I can regain some speed and system stability. Maybe in the future Vista will work OK, but not right now... --- 3. The incompatibility issues-- though there are several-- conspicuously include problems with Mac-oriented software (iPod, Adobe). I can't help but feel that Microsoft built-in these specific incompatibility issues in order to battle Apple
This sofa is a complete bargain.  It's stylish in design and comfortable.  The cushion is firm and supportive. The colour and texture of the all-weather wicker is fantastic.  It's strong, standing up to our kids, yet light and easy to move around.  It arrived very promptly and I'm delighted
I love this item with my first son and I got them again for my second son. Great product, keeps them warm without getting overheated and then you don't have to worry about loose blankets at night
I just love this grill.  I previously had a regular Weber kettle charcoal grill, but when my son took it to college I had the perfect excuse to upgrade.   --- The grill is large enough to grill meat and veggies for a family of 4 to 6. The cooking grate has hinged sides. This allows you to easily add more coals every hour or so for extended indirect grilling cooking.  You won't believe how handy the very large and stable table is; it is very durable and cleans up nicely.   --- Store your large bag of charcoal in the rain protected bin, then just pull out the bag to pour charcoal right into the 2 charcoal holders. The charcoal holders keep the coals gathered together to light well and eliminate the need for a "charcoal chimney".  You only need to run the propane burner for 5 minutes to get the coals started, so one canister lasts quite long. (I always set a timer so I don't forget to turn it off.) The charcoal holders are perfect for indirect grilling, just push them to the sides of the kettle when the coals are ready. If direct grilling, you can still use the charcoal holders to heat the coals, then use tongs to dump the coals onto the bottom grate when they are ready. Very convenient.  The bottom wire shelf makes a perfect spot to set the hot charcoal holders after you dump the coals into the grill. --- The stainless steel ash catcher works very well.  (The non-stainless ash catcher on my regular kettle grill didn't work as smoothly and used to catch and jam sometimes.) --- The lid holder is really great.  Just pick up the lid and slide it to the left and it is held in place for you.  No more trying to hang the lid from the little lid hook. --- The thermometer is very handy to monitor temperature for longer cooking items.  If you are BBQing ribs or a roast, keeping the temperature regulated low is important. --- All these little conveniences simply add up to a nice cooking experience. --- I enjoy my gas grill too, but it takes a little more skill to cook over charcoal.  I have a feeling of accomplishment and satisfaction when I serve up a perfectly cooked meal from my beautiful Weber Performer grill. --- Find a spot to show it off - this beauty really looks great in the yard
After devouring this book, I immediately passed it to a client who is developing a speaking business. Lenny's book is full of real-life examples and practical tips for communicating  clearly and powerfully. Whether you want to speak professionally or just communicate better in your day-to-day life, this is the book for you
All of my 2" hitch units work fine with this adapter.  I downsized from a SUV with a 2" and went to a compact car with a 1 1/4".  This allows me to use my bike carriers, luggage racks, etc
Just thought I'd share my my opinion. --- I think ID2 is a great game with a very deep lore, great graphics, replayability and more. If your into RPG games this is right up your alley
The first time I read this book was at the age of 13. My mother had an old, worn, 1950s copy of the book on our bookshelf, and one day I just decided to give it a try. I think the first 50 pages were a bit of a mystery to me. I remember struggling with the language at the beginning, and having to look up several words in the dictionary. After 100 pages, I had finally "learnt the language," and managed to at last translate it into my native tongue. I enjoyed it, and over the years I returned to it again and again. Now, at the age of 35, I practically have numerous passages memorized, and reading the book is no longer a culture shock. Every word of this novel is an old friend, and I wouldn't remove a single one from the text. This is the book I turn to when I'm in the mood to read, but not in the mood to read something new. ---  --- Every time I read it, I am struck by its relevance. I don't mean the morals or the need to marry well in order to win approval from society (although I think we still see a little of that to this day). I refer to the characters. Their personalities and basic code of principals are timeless. I can identify with every single character in this novel. When Lizzy and Mr. Darcy fell in love, their courtship could have taken place anywhere and at any point in time. That is why her novels are so well adapted into modern films. ---  --- You cannot possibly do wrong by reading this novel
I just purchased the small bottle(Thank God) of the Ojon ultra hydrating shampoo and conditioner.  It seems like it made my hair a little softer, but the smell is horrendous.  I have gotten the worst headache from the smell of this product. So overall it may make my hair feel softer, but there is no way I will put this stuff on my head again.  The rest is going in the trash
If it were up to my children, they would rate this stuff 5+ stars.  They love it and they are totally entertained with it.  It is one of the only times they play quietly without fighting.  Mom, on the other hand, hates it and you know it is bad when a toy gives mom some free time of peace and quiet and she wants no part of it!!! ---  --- This stuff sticks to everything and anything-including your children.  You can't believe the mess it makes.  Imagine billions of tiny little balls stuck to everything in your house.  I confine it to their playroom, but it follows them everywhere they go.  You will find it all over your house and in everything-you can't escape it.   ---  --- As for the product itself, it definitely doesn't dry out, but it also doesn't hold together as well as described making it quite difficult to make the objects it claims you can make on the package.  Once you put colors together it is impossible to separate them out as they are tiny millimeter balls.  Playdooh may dry out if left out, but it doesn't make anywhere near the mess this stuff does and it also molds much better than playfoam! ---  --- My advice is to stick with your playdooh
I recently received the item and I love it. It is whisper quiet, works in both directions, and is automatic. I have seen other winders at 5x this price that don't do the same. Any of the winder would be a waste of money unless they sell a single winde
Dave Barry has written and selected an extremely humorous collection of his articles from The Miami Herald.  There is a huge margin in difference of quality in Boogers are My Beat than in his initial non fiction books such as Dave Barry's Bad Habits.  Boogers are My Beat is one of those rare books that once you start turning the pages you don't want to put down until the back cover.  Dave Barry educates his fellow man on a diverse range of topics such as why you can't use the towels hanging in the bathroom, the Salt Lake City Olympics, babies on airlines, North Dakota, Bear in the Big Blue House and cell phones to name just a few.   ---  --- His article written the day after September 11 and one written a year after, about the Philadelphia crashed plane are also included which prove Barry could have been a serious writer if he had pursued that career.  Thankfully he didn't because the rest of the book is hysterically funny as is his Carl Hiaasen style fiction novel Tricky Business.  Big Trouble isn't bad either. Check them out along with his other non fiction novels as well.     
I intend to have the very first item in this read at my memorial service - which I hope won't be soon! Some of this was slightly dated, but always good reading. He had such a unique take on his world and such a down-to-earth way of looking at the goings-on around him.
Before I was even done with Final Fantasy VII, I ordered this game. I loved that game, and thought 'Say, if Final Fantasy VII is this good, then VIII must be even better!', boy was I wrong! I'm not bashing Final Fantasy VIII, I kind of liked the game, but there are big problems with it. First of all, the draw system is kind of hard, but I liked it, it was a change of pace, but the way you have to equip summon GFs (Guardian Force) was hard and boring. The music in the game reminds me of the music in the movie 'AKIRA', which is a bad thing, The characters in battle remind me of crash dummies, and the way that you get new weapons is by making them at junk shops! Not only that, but the characters are not very likeable. ---  --- Main characters: ---  --- Squall- A member of SeeD, he is a jerk to everybody. ---  --- Zell-A member of SeeD, he is a surfer dude and a dunce. ---  --- Quistis-A teacher and a member of SeeD, she seems to like Squall...for one reason or another... ---  --- Seifer- Squall's rival, he is even worse then Squall. ---  --- Rinoa- A member of 'The owls',Square soft ran out of ideas, she is just like Aeris. ---  --- Selphie- A member of SeeD, she is a weird character and I was sad to see her in Kingdom hearts. ---  --- Laguna- A Galbadian soldier. He is the best charecter in the game. ---  --- Irvine-A member of SeeD, he is a lady's man and is recycled later in Final Fantasy IX as a better charecter known as Zidane. ---  --- This game is the second worst Final Fantasy game ever made. The story is great, but playing it is so bad that its almost unbelivable. If Square soft remade this game for the PS2 or PSP, I would buy it, but only if they removed the draw system
My 8-month-old son and I listen to this CD every night, and by the Pachelbel Canon (track 7) he's usually sound asleep.  It is NOT ALL SYNTHESIZER.  The jacket clearly states that the "Music Box Orchestra" includes flute, piano, cello, percussion, english horn, and oboe.  As a musician, I am not offended by the "easy-listening" versions of these classics.  In fact, I enjoy them.  They introduce my son to the timeless melodies WITHOUT OVERSTIMULATING HIM at bedtime.  I find them relaxing too
This coat was listed as camel, but when it arrived it was actually tan.  Even the tag says tan.  I was disappointed because it was the only Christmas gift that I had for my husband.  I never would have ordered a tan.  Also the coat fit like a whole size larger.  I had to return it and it has been well over a month and I still have not received my refund
 ---         While Peter Jay Fernandez and Jay O. Sanders aren't the only actors to narrate the acclaimed Cross series, they certainly are among the finest. ---  ---  With a host of television appearances to his credit (Law & Order, Cosby)  Massachusetts born Hernandez has also made his mark on Broadway in Jelly's Last Jam and The Merchant of Venice.  His voice has a tad of huskiness, which makes it all the more appealing as Cross.  In all, Fernandez has been featured in almost 12 of the Alex Cross tales, so he well knows the characters and easily inhabits each scene.  ---  ---  To date, Jay O. Sanders has narrated over 50 audio books, and he's a perfect voice partner for Fernandez.  His experience includes off-Broadway roles in Shakespearean plays, which may account for his remarkably clear diction and easy listening tone.  The voices of Fernandez and Sanders complement one another as they bring one of the most compelling Cross stories to life. ---  ---  It's a painful attention-getter when we listen again to how Cross lost his beloved wife, Maria - she was shot down before his eyes.   Her killer was never found; the case chalked off as another sick drive-by shooting.  Now, Cross has returned to being a psychologist, his children are thriving, and perhaps he may be able to love someone again. ---  ---  However, a telephone call from John Sampson, his old partner,  changes all that.   Sampson wants Cross's help in finding a psychopathic serial rapist on the loose in Georgetown. Of course, Cross can't say no but little did he realize that this investigation would lead him to a tie-in to Maria's death some years ago. ---  ---  One more rapid paced thriller from the amazing pen of James Patterson read by two consummate voice performers. ---  ---         - Gail Cook
They have the hebrew backwards!! You are supposed to read hebrew right to left-the opposite of english and this cd has it left to right. I find it extremely confusing. I know how to read hebrew and I wanted to learn how to speak it. --- What a poor effort!
VERY VERY DISSAPOINTED. E-40 RAPS TOO QUICK, HE IS TOO HARD TO UNDERSTAND AND HE SOUNDS LIKE A TRICK
This gun sucks! --- -it has the worst range out of all the ones I own. When I lob it, I can only shoot twenty feet. --- -fps sucks. i can shoot my hand two inches from the barrel and it doesn't hurt. --- -flimsy. no joke, I dropped it when I was playing, and it shattered. --- -accuracy is a joke. I have a walled backyard, and I was at one end. When I lobbed it, I hit the the wall once (20 ft away.) I fired it again (twice) and I hit 5 and 7 ft away from my mark. --- -The one "good" thing about this gun is the price. 3 dollars is not bad for this piece of dog feces
American Spectator Mag. is an Oasis of true conservatism in this jungle of Liberalism!  Mr. Emitt Tyrell has got to be THE coolest guy to ever put together a magazine.  The information is fantastic, the intellect captivating. I highly reccommend it to everyone
Masterful, simply masterful.  There is no other word that can adequately convey the quality of this movie.  Every time I notice it on cable, I immediately stop whatever I am doing and follow it to conclusion.  I can think of no other Shakespearean film that echoes it except possibly, "The Tragedy of Julius Caesar" (Marlon Brando as Marc Anthony).  A commanding performance by Kenneth Branaugh, who should be knighted as a peer of the realm in my opinion, before another title is handed over to a Rolling Stone.  This film is the sole reason I still have VHS.  If anyone enjoyed this movie, I highly recommend the Brando version of Julius Caesar and Henry the Fifth 1989 - Kenneth Branaugh and see if you notice a young Christian Bale - the boy who would be Batman.  I have had many lively discussions with respected elders regarding the better Shakespearean actor - Olivier or Branaugh.  My money's on Branaugh
I purchased this version of the Ironman Triathlon 30-Lap for my two pre-teen boys.  They love it!  Very durable...easy to use...lightweight.  Can't beat the value either. ---  --- I own the larger men's version of this watch.  I'm on my second one though.  The first one lasted about a year before it developed condensation under the glass, then stopped working.  I surf 3-4 times per week and I wasn't rinsing the watch well with fresh water.  I'm guessing that the salt deposits compromised the seal on the watch. ---  --- I've had my second one for over a year now and it's like new!  I highly recommend this watch if you're very active and want a good lightweight watch that's waterproof
Turbotax is okay if you only have a 1040A to file, but anything beyond that it quickly becomes a real pain in the nether region.  Not only that, but if you have complications with trying to file, good luck. --- It looks as though I will have to pay to have my estate taxes filed.  Ttax is worthless
I didn't know why I chose to read this book. Anyway, it was disappointing, really. The book was slow, and it was too long for a story of its type. I mean, I think the book could go on without some of the parts. When I was reading it, I only thought of putting it down because it's making me go crazy. I thought the plot was shallow, but Taylor's self-conflict was even shallower. He kept on blaming himself about his father's death well then it's really his fault! He was a coward. If you don't believe me, go on and read about it... although you might get bored getting to that part because it's towards the end. And I hated it when this stupid conflict got in the way with his relationship with Denise. He was acting really immature! He should have at least thought about Denise but he was too selfish. It really sucked. ---  --- And yes, I know that this is supposed to be a romance novel... but I kept on looking for that love factor althroughout the book. And what did I find? NOTHING. Oh, what a waste. It's like Sparks tried very hard to make the situations in the story seem romantic but as a reader, it didn't really capture the whole essence of what romantic situations should be like. ---  --- If it hadn't been for my HRR (Home Reading Report) I wouldn't have finished reading this at all. ---  --- I guess I'm saying this because I'm not into this genre. Love stories are fine but this one... nah
Alvin Lee is a genius with a guitar.  Nowhere is this more evident than in his mastery of the Blues.  He was and is a great rocker, but his true calling is as a bluesman.  This is a great album
After reading other reviews on air mattresses I was worried that this mattress would not last long before a leak developed.  But it's been over 2 months and so far so good.  I sleep on it every night, (I'm buying a real bed when I move in June) and it is holding up
I had another Norelco shaver for the last 5 (or more) years.  The difference in the shaves is striking.  Both less pain when my stubble is a little long and closer. ---  --- However, the reason this shaver is cheaper is that there is 1 battery inside it instead of 2.  I know this because I took it in to be "repaired" because I only got 8 shaves to a charge.  I talked (online) with Norelco and they said my shaver was broken.  So, I looked up on the Norelco site a local authorized repair shop.  I took it in and the guy opened it up.  He said it was one of the "cheap" versions that has 1 instead of 2 batteries. ---  --- My old shaver, over most of its life, gave me 25 or so shaves before needing to be recharged.  That's quite a difference
I subscribed to Forbes magazine for a year or two, and in general the content is good, but I cancelled my subscription for 3 reasons. (A) 33% of the pages are ALL advertisements - what a waste of space, (B) every magazine has 3 or 4 renewal postcards that fall out onto the floor as I read the magazine, and (B) the classifieds in the back are "not of interest" to any real business person. If you don't mind the ads and the fluff, then this magazine might be right for you! It's not for me. I give it 2 stars
The sleeves on this fleece are very long.  I have a 34" sleeve and a medium nearly covered my entire hands.  Not practical if you want to play any sports with this fleece.  I returned mine
I bought this monopod about 3 weeks ago after reading the reviews here. I'm not sure if I got a defective unit but I've had these problems from the gitgo: ---  --- -I noticed the 2 lower sections will not open and close smoothly, they would get stuck about 2-3 inches from the lock and you'd need force to expand/retract them. Very interestingly, if the section right above the one I'm trying to expand/retract is unlocked then the operation is smooth and flawless! --- -The ballhead does not support my Nikon D80 and lightest lens (18-55mm) a less than 2 lbs combo, which is much lighter than the 4.4 lbs weight limit indicated in the specs. The camera just slumps in one direction or another regardless of how hard I try to make sure the ballhead is locked tightly. ---  --- Again, it might have been a defective unit, but I thought I'd point my observations out anyway. I wanted to buy this from Amazon, it wasn't in stock, it was sitting in my shopping cart and when it became available Amazon bumped the price to $40+, so I went elsewhere and got it for $30.
Yes, this movie is kind of unrealistic but so what. And just to re-clear up the bike thing. It wasn't a coaster brake bike like you had on your old banana seat bike when you were a kid. It's a track bike with a fixed gear. Which means the pedals spin as long as the rear wheel spins. And backward pressure slows your speed but does not completely stop it.That why he always jumped off the back and grabed the seat when he wanted to stop quickly. That is also why anyone crazy enough to ride a track bike on the street usually has a front brake installed. Look at the scenes where he is freestyling in his apartment. He is pedaling backward. This can only be done on a fixed gear. No coaster brake. If you look really closely at some of the scenes you will be able to see different bikes. Like when Bacon rides down the stairs, you can see the bike he's on has brakes. Obviously for the stunt. But I really like this movie. I've been a messenger and I always wanted the place I worked to be like that movie. We never went outside and freestyle in the street while the boom box played. And hot girls never gave me their phone number. But we get to see Lawrence Fishburne as Voodoo when was still know as Larry. And that's worth the 13 bucks right there
The D300 is easy to use it takes great video outside, and is very good in low light. It also takes very good pictures,and the battery last a long time. I would buy it again
I bought these strap covers: --- 1. because my daughter's neck was being rubbed raw by the straps of her Snugride, and --- 2. because I could get them in PINK and she would no longer be confused for a boy all the time! --- This product solved both problems.  When I took them out of the packaging and realized how BIG they were I was pretty concerned that my daughter would be uncomfortable even though they are really soft.  Luckily, she adapted easily to them and I think she even likes having them there because she can kind of chew on it and they also hold her head up like a travel pillow when she falls asleep in her carseat
These earrings are perfect! Perfect in size, color and weight. They're not much bigger then a quater and very light, in a beautiful white gold shine. Yes the post are thicker then most, but after a few days you get use to them. I had a pair like these that were given to me as a gift and I lost one. When I found these on Amazon I wasn't sure how much they would be like my other. They are a perfect match and my old pair was at least 7-8 years old. If you want a perfect hoop that is good for day or night these are the ones
Until a couple of years ago this used to be the gold standard of leave-ins:  It made my dry, curly hair soft, shiny, and smelling great!  But lately something has changed. The once thick, silky liquid has turned thin and watery, with a distinctly alcohol-like smell.  It's so disappointing... this product has gone from 5 to 2 stars in my book.  Don't bother with it anymore, unless the original formula comes back
what a beautiful album! one of the rare albums that  has no fillers or weaker cuts. i'd call it a classic but that makes it sound dusty. these songs could come out in 20 years and still sound fresh. 
I bought this product because it was a cheaper alternative to the Senseo coffee pods I've been buying. I don't have much to compare with, but overall, this decaff tases fine
The screen is too small. if you want to watch it in your car, you have to cover it because the back light is too week.
The pages of Men's Journal used to be an escapist   weekend getaway in themselves. They brought you to extreme parts of the globe with a literary style that disappeared after 9/11. Since that time, MJ has concentrated on telling its readers who their heros should be, which might have been fine for one issue. This is a magazine badly in need of a new editor and old ideas
Shannon Lawson is capable of a much better album.  I saw him down in Nashville when he was with the Galoots, and it was amazing!  If they were to put out a CD I'm sure it would be one of my favorites.  Shannon has a voice and a talent for bluegrass music and that's what Nashville should have let him do on his first solo CD.  Instead they gave it this generic, overproduced sound, leaving Shannon sound like everyone else.  With the way bluegrass is selling these days, it's a shame that Shannon couldn't showcase his enormous talent in the proper arena..
This is a fun version of Battleship. And the nice part is being able to play against the game
No longer intended to be a comprehensive reference, the Guinness Book is now a sort of compilation of interesting superlatives with oversized pictures and many features that aren't even actual records ("Most Overrated Celebrity").  If you're going to do this, why not offer one edition that plays it by the book? ---  --- So dies a noble institution
The details are all fine if you don't know the middle east - but are not well researched and inconsistent.  I won't bore you with the list.   ---  --- All the big picture takeaway is that the middle east and big oil are a complicated business with many parties that have a big stake.  Tell us something new.   ---  --- The overall storyline does not have much else going for it - I was expecting more intrigue, a more synthesized story line.  A disappointment. 
With the New Year just more than six hours away, I --- must tell you that no matter a full moon, half moon, --- quarter moon, or no moon at all, please avoid the --- flick "Darkwolf" for many moons to come.  What a joke. ---  What a silly, stupid, insult to one's intelligence.  --- The script could have been written by my dog --- Stan...and even then, I give him the benefit of the --- doubt to come up with something much more canine.   ---  --- Let's put it this way.  Have you ever seen a film that --- contained people that irritated you so much, you --- simply didn't give a ^&^%* if they got blown away?  I --- was hoping the entire cast got mulched by Mr. Wolf --- less that 30 minutes into this loser.  Go "Darkwolf".  --- Take a few chucks out of this cast, its director, --- producer, writer and editors as quickly as --- possible...and don't wait until the next full moon.    ---  --- "Darkwolf" is an insult to motion pictures.  More so, --- it is an insult to such credible werewolf classics as --- "The Wolf Man", "Wolfen" and "The Howling", not to --- mention the tongue-in-cheek horror classic "An --- American Werewolf in London".   ---  --- Need I say more?  "Darkwolf" has no bite.  It's claws --- and fangs have been chiselled to oblivion.  The box --- claims this flick to be "Half Man.  Half Wolf. Pure --- Evil."  In reality it is Half/Whole Stupid. Half/Whole --- Worthless.  ...and...Pure ^%&*!   ---  --- Get my drift?  At midnight...as we turn another page --- and the new year unfolds...I promise you you will --- enjoy reruns of every episode of "Mary Hartman, Mary --- Hartman", much more than "Darkwolf".   ---  --- I'm off to watch yet another New Year's flick before --- dawn.  I need to make amends to Lon Chaney, Jr. before --- midnight.   ---  --- Bottom line, it was a film you didn't really care --- "where" the "wolf" came from, or where the werewolf --- was going.  Pitiful...embarrassing..."I've seen the --- bad moon rising" but this one makes me wish it would --- set! 
I was able to use the Canon EF 1.4X II Extender for some nature photography recently in Wyoming.  I shot elk in low light conditions so I was shooting pretty much wide open.  The extender did not compromise the inherent sharpness of the lens at all.  You could see the hairs on the animals heads.  It's fantastic
i like clinique a lot i needed powder so i got it, in beige..i also like the double pressed powder for even more coverage..fast shippin
I've been a gamer for almost 20 years.  This is the best mouse I've ever owned.  It is fast, accurate, well formed and constructed.  I would definitely recommend it. --- The DPI adjustment is a nice touch.  I prefer corded mice due to cordless being to heavy, this mouse is just right
As my brother said when flipping through this book, "If girls start acting like guys then what do we need them for?"  Why should you pretend to be someone or something you're not to get a guy?  If someone dumps you because you like mushy love songs, cry at sad movies, like babies and puppies, or because you have embarrassing girl products in your medicine cabinet, he isn't worth it anyway!  And why on earth would you sleep with someone who didn't love you enough to want you around the next morning?  "Think Like a Guy" doesn't guarantee you a perfect relationship anymore than The Rules or Stop Getting Dumped or Mars and Venus or any of the other ridiculous relationship books that have been popular over the last few years.  Be yourself.  If a man can't deal with that, then he isn't the right one for you
My son LOVES to "drive" cars. I saw this and thought he would love it. It is totally unrealistic, doesnt make much noise (which for some parents that would be a +, but in this case its not) and it is not entertaining at all. Paid entirely tooooo much money for something that he will not play with at all. I have tried letting some of my friends children play with it, and they dont seem to enjoy it either.
Anyone ever see any of these rap "artists" perform live? They're the most boring, derivative "entertainers" in the world. They walk up and down the stage grabbing their crotch and YELL their lyrics. They go from talking on records to yelling on stage. Quite a stretch. All this is done with about thirty of their no-name friends prancing around stage with microphones saying "YEAH!" "UH-HUH!" "WHAT!" "THAT'S RIGHT!" "UH!" etc. Get real. ---  --- Meanwhile, the only "music" provided is a backing track cued by some dude backstage. It makes for the most dull, predictable "concert" you'll ever see.  ---  --- I can't wait until all this nonsense just disappears. In a world of common sense, these idiots would still be flipping burgers at McDonald's. --- 
The only redeeming points of this book are the few conversations that the author has with his uncle. The rest is just quotations from other books. There is enough original material here for about a chapter and a half. The author was set on making a book out of it so he just padded it with things that other authors had said.  ---  --- I read it to the end though. Probably because the author has a very nice writing style. He is probably a good playwrite though I have never read any of his plays. He just didn't have enough material for a book here. I'm surpised it got published
I started my first subscription to this one in 1980-81. It was EXCELLENT!! It had all kinds of great advice and help on real issues relating to "preventing" ailments/conditions.  Now it's a little advertising manual for drug users and fad dieters!  Wow...what a change now. I'm not interested in "paying" to read ads. I'll get my motivation and information on more reliable sources.  Besides, I got tired of all the little order forms that kept falling out on my lap while I rode the stationery bike!  What a waste of trees. :
This is Jewel's first CD and I enjoyed it especially Foolish Games and You Were Meant For Me. I can't wait for her latest
I bought this tea chest for my father.  He loves it, and it's a good deal for the money.  It's the perfect storage solution, and a pleasant way to select your morning teabag, too. ---  --- Recommended
Maybe I'm bias because I really like Yamaha, maybe, because I have kinda' good ears or, it's the fat check sitting on my table  from Yamaha; but what ever it is I realllllllly like this sub-woofer. ---  ---  I looked around a long time for the right sub, and, I like to think I got a good one here. ---  You want power? Ok, it's only 250 watts -not 1,000 watts like Velodyne, but in my room (30 by 18ish with a 25 foot ceiling) it ROCKS. ---   --- I love music, all kinds; loud or quiet no matter I like both, but I do like depth more than volume. However, I believe if you are going to listen to something real loud, being able to feel the music is as important as being able to here it. --- And let me say you can FEEL music if you want to. ---  one of the things I love most about this sub is it's range; it can (maybe) reach 20 hertz. 20 hertz! that is astounding. --- 20Hz is the lowest frequency the human ear can hear, in fact it's starting into the range of sounds that are felt more than heard. ---  --- Maybe I have good ears and maybe I don't, but to hear rich airy low-end, and, bass notes. yes! bass NOTES! bass is not one big boomy lump of noise, it's huge, open, grazing pasture of distinct sounds! ---  --- In short, music sounds great, even hip-hop (which I don't like) sounds, well, better. --- Also, their is no need to turn the volume way up to hear a improvement; at very quiet levels too, you can hear good clean bass notes. But, if you do a lot of quite listening, we're talking back ground music levels: disable the auto-on feature and manually turn it on and off, because if you happen to be listening to something quiet, even if you still can here low notes from this, it does not seem to be enough signal to keep the auto-on, well... on. ---   --- It improves movies as well, take something  with a lot of dynamics like, "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" or, "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow" there are a lot of sudden loud, and very low sounds in those movie's and the Yamaha handles it all with aplomb. ---   --- With most of the controls are on the front set-up is and tweaking is made easy, and if you are wondering about the "BASS" button: if the button is in the "music" position you will have to turn the volume to a higher level to shake the termites out of the walls than if its set to the "movie" position (I think "music" is a flatter frequency response). ---  As this review seems to be getting a bit long I'll some it up: --- yes, there are far better subwoofers out there (like from B&W), but I don't have the money for those, and if someone gave me a 1,000 watt Velodyne I would take it in a heartbeat- but, I wouldn't want to give this one up too. --- It's a absolute pleasure to listen to. ---  ---  --- Update: I have run some test tones on this subwoofer, and well, it can not reach 20Hz. 38Hz seems to be the limit for usable bass, although it is still audible to around 32Hz, 20Hz is a stretch. --- If 38Hz sounds to high: their are not many movie's or CD's that have any sounds below 35Hz. And very, very few have sound below 25Hz. --- Although it does not go as low as I would have hoped, it is still a good sub for the money, and still worth a five star review
This man is like Michael Bay.  Using high speed action sequences and terrible casting and script writing, the fact that Chris Tucker appears in this and almost every movie that the man makes signals a trend to do these as not so much movies as they are music video comedys only it's patheic and not funny, and that is also why the man who is now making X-Men 3 will cause that movie franchise to die a quick death at the movies.  The man is a joke
I was thrilled to see this available on CD .......... it is the most delightful Christmas 'album' of it's time & IT CONTINUES TO DELIGHT!  I purchased several and gave to friends for Christmas - every single receipient was immediately thrilled to have this 'album' on CD stating, 'this was my favorite, where'd you find it?"  Great gift
The PJ bottoms were soft and of good quality material. However, I ordered the extra large, and they were very small for that size.  It seemed as though the XL was more a Med/Large.  I would also think that "lounge pants" or "PJ bottoms" would be a bit bigger as you wouldn't want these types of pants too tight.  They were a gift, so I just hope they don't shrink after washing! 
Seems amidst the turbulence and brouhaha of that James Frey fiasco, anybody who now pens their auto-bios have to first be as famous and beloved as Billy Crystal.  But then they can only put out the cotton-candy Coney Island fluff as '700 Sundays' is.   ---  --- Granted, the book is based on Crystal's highly-praised Tony Award winning theatrical performance about time with his father and relatives when growing up during the 50s et al.  But it's nothing more than an appetizer to fill in and/or tide one over during the day and night Kaddish.  Yet in ripping a page out of Billy's book, it's not hard to imagine how that rapid-fire exchange between him and his agent went.  It probably went something like: ---   --- "Hey, bubby, how about writing a book talking about your 700 Sundays with your pop?" ---  --- "Well, I'm not a writer per se.  I just jot down a few notes here and there, and then go out and perform the material on stage." ---  --- "So here's a few blank pages of paper; write down what you have." ---  --- "It'll only be 45 maybe 50 pages at most; and it sounds and looks much better than it reads." ---  --- "Don't worry, bubby, I know people who know people who...you get the idea...at the publishers.  Here's their recipe: They'll take your 50 wholesale pages and spread `em out across 180 retail pages.  'How?' may you ask!  Well, they'll cut `em in half, then cut `em in half again.  And using big ink letters so even grandmas can read it without their glasses; surround it by a whole lot of white space; toss in some pictures at different angles from your family album -- Slap it all together between two hardcovers...It'll be just fine." ---  --- "Yes, but..." ---  --- "Don't worry.  Consider it like a vintage bottle of Mogen David 20/20 wine, aged a few months before it makes it to the shelves of your favorite corner liquor store hangout.  In this case, the local bookstores.  Oh, and make sure you give `em just enough to whet their taste buds; leave `em wanting more and thirsty for more.  People'll drink it up." ---  --- "Yes, but..." ---  --- "Don't worry, Face.  Everybody loves ya.  Just toss in a few tidbits from your routines about Satchmo and Mantle, you'll be all right.  Don't forget now, we've got the sequels all lined up for ya too. Y'know `700 Mondays;' then `700 Tuesdays' and so on.  Yes'sir, I can see it all now:  We've got the lock on all those 700 days of the week shtick.  Oh, and we'll do some holiday editions too, starting with `700 Hanukkahs!' ---  --- "You're still friends with that kid, Adam Sandler, back from your SNL days, aren't ya?!  Yes, so we'll get you and him together to come up with new lyrics to that Hanukkah song of his.  It'll be a great collaboration.  It's good to pass down the ladder to them other kids climbing up once you've made it. Y'know God blesses and doesn't forget those things by them who do.  Yes, ok, so we'll go ahead from there and do `700 Passovers!' ---  --- "And it'll be an annual event too, dont'cha know.  Just think, when people see Chuck Heston...may God keep a special place in heaven for him...when people see Chuck Heston and The Ten Commandments, they'll be thinking about you too, Billy.  Yes'sir, we'll have em crying and laughing every year on Passover, you'll see. ---  --- "Oh, and holy of holies, out of the deal we'll get `700 Yom Kippurs!'   You'll see.  But this will be only for our people, Billy, you understand.  So you might have to dig deep to get material for it.  But that's what authors do, they dig deep.  But you already knew that, right?  Can you dig it, man?  I knew that you could. ---  --- "Yes, but..." ---  --- "Don't worry, Face, everybody loves ya!  Your books don't have to be earth-shattering or thought-provoking or anything like that.  But hey listen, with a book deal, a books-on-tape deal, and who knows even a movie deal, we'll turn your little leaden bits into golden nuggets.  Mark my words we will.  ---  --- "And say, since you haven't had a hit movie in awhile...no offense...we're going to get Martin Scorsese to produce and direct your life story.  Yes, it'll be something like 'Pinch Me I'm Still Jewish: The Billy Crystal Story' in widescreen and all that jazz.  It's what everybody in Hollywood's doing right now.  Yeah, no use waiting until your dying or dead already, Billy - God forbid.  No, siree, bubby!!   ---  --- "So Scorsese will do the movie on the cheap, because God knows the man deserves an Oscar already.  You know it, I know it, we all know it, Billy.  And not just an honorary or lifetime achievement either, but the really big one, see!  And just imagine, wouldn't it be something if you were hosting the awards ceremony and handed Marty his own Oscar?!  Yes, well, we can schmooze on about all this stuff later. ---  --- "But for now, with the books and everything, you'll be a one-man franchise, yes you will!  You'll be on the New York Times Best Seller List from now until forever!  It'll be great!!" ---  --- "Yes, but..." ---  --- "Oh and well, I didn't want to say anything just yet, but, okay, here goes: There might be plans to expand everything too!  Listen, bubby, I know somebody who knows somebody who...you get the idea...over at the networks.   ---  --- "We can do a little Chris Rock in the neighborhood sort of thing.  We'll put a kid who looks and acts like you - about as tall as you - into the neighborhood that you and your family lived in, see.   ---  --- "And it's going to be a period piece too!  We'll introduce all the new kids to the stars of yesteryear -- y'know, Cantor, Jolson, Jessel, Durante!  Throw in some goniffs and shiksas that the cast can work off of every week -- It'll be fun!   ---  --- "Chris Rock is great.  But you can be greater too.  Listen, Face, we'll make it a celebration.  Something like 'Growing up Mazel Tov!'  Maybe we get 700 shows out of it.  Maybe less, maybe more, but people will still love it anyway.  You'll see!" ---  --- "Yes, but, well, I'm not really a writer/author.  I'm an entertainer, so why would I want to do any of this?" ---  --- "We could make a couple of dollars!" ---  --- "Okay. I'm in!" ---  --- And so it went and so it goes. ---  --- Final analysis: A So Not Looking Mahvelous, Better Luck Next Time, With All Due Respect, Sadly Not Recommended Book.  --- 
I am not really a big candy person, but I received these white chocolates for Christmas, and let's just say I have a new found love of white chocolate. I have never had something so wonderful. It is truely a heavenly chocolate experience. If you haven't tried them you must, if you have, then welcome to the world of fine chocolates. Amen!!
I am a veteran screen printer and am kind of new to the graphic arts side.  This purchase has paid for itself over and over now that I don't have to run to someone else for art.  It was rumored that it is hard to find what is needed as there is no computer search for images...  I guess some people are too lazy to familiarize themselves with the book of images...  I did and I LOVE this product!!!!
The camera handles very well - it's light and drives my Zoom lens and 18-55mm lens beautifully. I get professional photographs and can use it all day without suffering from heavy weight, which it does not have. The view finder is excellent and the readout on the back of the camera is extremely helpful, showing photos as they are taken - with zoom on the back screen, which immediately gives me the idea of the photo I want to use in my books. I say this is an outstanding lens and camera.
I just got this myself and it works like a charm.  Installation took atbout 1/2 hour and it works just like it advertises. ---  --- I couple of things.  I agree with the need to place the solar cell within a couple of inches of the garage door light.  I have a sears craftsman with a flourescent bulb which is enough with the solar cell right above the light.  There is a pressure stick pad that holds the solar cell onto the garage door opener.  There is a black 3-4 foot wire (looks like an RCA audio wire and plug) that connects the solar cell to the laser beam generator which is maybe about 3/4" long and about 3/8s of the inch wide.  It too has a stick adhesive to be glued onto your garage ceiling.  The laser pivots easily so it can be aimed. ---  --- The actual beam emits a pulsing red dot not bigger than 1/8" wide onto your dashboard when you drive under it.  It takes a little getting used to a first to know what to look for when you're parking.  My garage ceiling is about 2 feet above the roof of the car so it's pretty close to the laser generator.  If you have a higher ceiling, the mounting is probably harder but the dot is maybe slightly bigger.  The one thing that I have to adjust is that my wife is shorter than me so she sees the beam alittle later than I do and has to sit up a bit in the seat to see it on the dashboard of our Toyota Sienna which is a little flat.  I need to re-aim the laser to an easier to spot point for her since this is her parking slot.   ---  --- Works like a charm - just wish the dot was little bigger to make it easier to spot when you pull in.  Great feature not to have any batteries or plug ins required
I purchased this program about 1.5 years ago. I have been casually studying German through other programs for about 4 years. The best basic words-only is through Unforgettable Languages (very basic, but easy as heck to learn). Rosetta Stone is the best for understanding gender, verb usage and adapting to the German style of sentence structure. I absolutely love all the functionality and versatility of the program. It is incredibly challenging to go from reading to typing and to speaking.  --- The only negative is that the CD has to be used to run the program. Even with an accelerated CD-Rom, the starting/stopping of the CD is distracting. If that feature were corrected, it would be perfect
This book was the first one I ever read about programming. It launched a whole new world of logical and complex thinking that I could never have understood without the magnificent touch that the author gives us. He applies very simple examples to explain very complex matters about programming instances adding humor and intelligence... what else would you want? --- It's simply excellent. 110% recommended.
I've never bought a wireless controller before...so I wasn't sure what to expect. But it turns out, this is probably the most comfortable video game controller in the world. the Logitech Wireless PS2 Action Controller is every bit as comfortable as the DualShock 2, and then some. It's a very curvy controller that fits almost too perfectly into the palms of your hands, and the buttons are placed great.  ---  --- The buttons never noticeably stick, the full D-Pad is Hundreds of times better than Sony's segmented D-Pad, and the analog sticks are EXTREMELY sensitive, responding to the lightest touch, and there are the start/select/analog buttons there 9though analog is called Mode on this controller), and a new button that turns vibration on or off. The placement of these four is good enough as you won't be using them often anyways. ---  --- Lag time is wonderful for this controller. There is NO noticeable lag whatsoever. The radio frequency causes NO interference, and the reciever is small and barely noticable, if not a bit, dare I say it, "cute". ---  --- The controller's weight is excellent too. It runs on batteries, yet is unbelievably light. The battery door does not stick out on the back uncomfortably either. Your batteries will also last you from 50 - 300 hours with vibration on/off. You won't even know you're playing with it when you're in the middle of a violent gunfight somewhere. It's just that good. The size is also comfortable and barely larger than the DualShock 2. Plus, there are no cords to trip over, pull out of the controller slot, or add to the mess of cords behind your entertainment center. ---  --- There is ONE small bad point about this. The vbration feature is not as good as the DualShock's. But there are just TOO MANY good things here about this controller that make it invaluable to buy, even with this minor drawback. ---  --- The Verdict: Guilty on the charges of being The most invaluable piece of PS2 hardware (aside from the console itself!) in the world. Sentenced to be bought by consumers around the world. Case dismissed
This mag has its ups and downs but there is no other magazine with more class and originality. It's an icon all over the world. The editor has inspired books and movies for her perfectionism and professionalism. She and Vogue have gone a long way toward making women strong and independent. Without Vogue magazine fashion would not be a multi-billion dollar industry
This is a great idea for a product! For those of you who don't wash your hair every day, this is a great way to keep it looking and smelling fresh on days you don't wash it. I used this after 5 days without washing, and while it might have worked better within 3 or 4 days, it still freshened my hair and made it beautiful! Well done
seems pretty good.  doesnt come with any directions on how to transfer files from your "C" drive into it
If you were a teenager in the mid-'90s (and enjoyed it), you will probably love this movie and relate to it.  It really captures the feel of the grunge era well. --- If, however, you're one of those people who hates grunge music because it's dark/depressing, you probably can't relate. --- Since I was in high school from '94-'98, I love Girl.  I happened upon it by accident (someone recommended Girl when he actually meant Party Girl), and I was so happy that I did.  But I know the time period has a bad reputation.  If you loathe Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Candlebox, My So-Called Life, and dyed hair, this movie probably isn't for you. --- All that said, I'm making my assessment of the movie without having read the book, so if you want a book/movie comparison you'll have to look at other reviews
do  not buy this i got a large and feels like a smal
I had heard a lot about how funny Margaret Cho was, and finally got a chance to watch her video. I find her way overrated. ---  --- She does have some funny stuff. She's got a particular knack for doing impressions, and there's some other genuinely funny material. ---  --- However, the funny stuff was diluted by the greater volume of material that was clearly just pandering to the audience. She does a lot of vulgar material, homosexual-oriented jokes, etc. that are clearly just there for the "outlaw" value. And she often descends in to abject preaching on topics that seem to either just be things that she's personally bitter about or are designed to ingratiate her to her fan base. It's just... not funny.
The item arrived in a timely manner and was represented correctly.  I'll use this company again
will you people stop wining about witch is better the psp and the ds both have ups and downs they are just as good, they just have differnt prices trust me i own both
This was my first online shoe order.  I figured it would be pretty safe since it was a slip-on.  I'm usually in a size 11 or 12, so I ordered a 12.  While my feet are pretty wide, I've never had to purchase wide shoes. ---  --- These shoes were incredibly tight.  They were long by about an inch, but the width was unbearably constricted.  They reminded me of squeezing on a pair of tight rock-climbing boots -- I really had to squish to get my feet in. ---  --- The result was so uncomfortable, these are going back.  I wouldn't have expected this from 'slip-on' shoes.  It gets a two instead of a one since the quality appears great
I bought this straightener TWO times..the first time i had it for about 8 months. My friend had bought the straightener and I fell in love, so I bought my own. The first 8 months were heaven. I straightened my hair all the time. Then, at 8 months, one of the plates stopped working! For a while i used it, but it took forever, and didn't straighten my hair well at all. I decided to buy another, thinking that it was just a defect on the first. I bought the other and it didn't work nearly as well as I had remembered! In fact, it stopped heating up all together within 3 months!! Another friend of mine bought this same straightener and it caused problems for her as well. We have both decided against buying this one again, obviously, and I would reccommend you do, too. I have heard that the newest Conair straightener is wonderful, and comes with a two-year warranty, so I wouldn't have to pay again, if it did the same thing to me that this one did. DON'T BUY IT! unless, of course, you enjoy being ripped-off..
A lot of my friends like to shop online, so I added this to my baby registry.  My best friend received one at her shower and she loves it!  So when I got TWO at my shower, it wasn't the disaster other duplicate gifts can be!  My little girl is now three months old and we are still getting a lot of use out of the Fresh Whole Rabbits
This was a bomb. It was guilt inducing because I had to throw it away. I got two of them,like an idiot.
This is a great beginner's guide to home buying.  The advice is straightforward and the explanations are easy to understand.  ---  --- Buying a home is a scary and daunting prospect for me.  I kept getting a lot of conflicting advice from relatives, friends, and coworkers on when to buy, what to buy, and how to buy.  This is very frustrating as everyone means well, but what worked for them might not apply to me. And don't bother asking a realtor or mortgage company if you should buy--they make their living on our decisions to buy!  ---  --- So I bought Home Buying for Dummies to learn more, and it has a lot of sound and thoughtful guidance to help decide when and how much to buy...  And also how to find a good home, and then negotiate with the realtors, the sellers, the mortgage companies, and everyone else that is sticking their hands in your wallet.   ---  --- The author's advice is realistic, and he points out the pitfalls of jumping in and what trouble you can get into with the different loan options out there
For an egg free, wheat free, gluten free, dairy free bread it's an excellent bread.  Good consistency and texture and it tastes quite similar to typical bread.  My two year old loves eating it
I-Dog is so fun to use!  All you have to do is plug the included cable into your digital player's headphone port and I-Dog will play your music through a tiny internal speaker.  I-Dog's face will light up with various patterns and colored lights depending on what type of music you play.  His tail serves as a mute button, but be careful because he doesn't like you touching too often!  I-Dog will get sad if you don't give him any music to listen to.  If you don't have a digital player, you can set I-dog by your boombox or other music device and he can "hear" that way.  There are only two reasons why I didn't give I-Dog 5 stars:  (1) The internal speaker isn't very loud, so you have to have your music player turned up quite high, and (2) the battery cover on I-Dog's back leg is really hard to get off.  You will definitely need some kind of tiny screwdriver to get it off
Valkyrie Profile is a cult classic.  No matter how you look at it.  It was one of those games you either loved or hated.  Obviously enough people loved it enough for Square-Enix to re-release the original on the PSP and make a second one on the Playstation 2.  The end result is a great game that should satisfy fans of the original.  ---  --- Despite what it looks like, Valkyrie Profile 2: Silmeria is not a sequel to Valkyrie Profile but a prequel.  This means if you've never played the first one, fear not, you aren't missing anything.   ---  --- The story centers on Silmeria.  She's a Valkyrie trapped in the body of Princess Alicia.  Because of this it seems like Alicia has a split personality, and that she's got to be crazy or something.  As a result, Alice doesn't have very many friends... if any at all.  Silmeria, has been exiled by Odin, the leader of the Gods.  She now wants revenge for what he has done to her, and since Alice has no friends, she agrees to help.  It's an interesting story, but much like the first one, gets off to a really slow start and takes a while to pick up.   ---  --- The game's story is told through beautiful cinematics  Not quite the best looking game on the PS2, but beautiful enough.  The backgrounds, characters and monsters are all detailed.  Especially in some of the games cutscenes.  The voice acting is also suitable enough for the game.  The game also sounds really good.   ---  --- The good news about Valkyrie Profile 2 is that there is no time limit.  Fans of the first will remember that there was a time limit before the battle at the end of the game.  Valkyrie Profile 2 does away with that and thank goodness it does.  This gives you far more time to explore and do everything the game has to offer, and the dungeons are quite interesting.  ---  --- Most Dungeons are pretty simple.  It sort of plays out in an action/adventure style.  You have photons you can fire at your enemies and certain objects.  Your photon also reflects off some objects, and it's actually vital to use this in some dungeons.  So the photon isn't just there, it's essential.  Even more interesting in Valkyrie Profile is the battle system.  ---  --- Battles are contact based.  In battle you've got your characters on one side and your enemies on the other.  At first it seems like battles take place in real time, but in reality, the enemy only moves when you move.  This gives you more than enough time to plan out a strategy.  Each enemy has an attack zone.  If you're in it, you'll be attacked.  In most RPGs getting attacked is no big deal.  In Valkyrie Profile 2 it's much more than just a big deal.  The difficulty of this game escalates really fast. You'll quickly find yourself overwhelmed by some of your enemies.  Luckily there is a solution.  Most battles have a leader.  If you defeat the leader you win automatically without having to worry about defeating the others.  It helps if you want to end the battle quickly, and especially helps when your party is being decimated.  Still, the battle system calls for complete strategy on your part.   ---  --- They say it takes about 40 hours to complete Valkyrie Profile 2.  However, you'll find yourself spending most of these hours leveling up to take on new challenges.  As I mentioned, the difficulty level rises fast.  Meaning you'll probably do a lot of battling in a dungeon before moving on to the next.  Even worse, you'll have to backtrack out of a dungeon once you complete it.  Even worse than that, enemies respawn when you reenter a room.  The good thing about this at least, is that the dungeons aren't overly long.  Again, however, you'll spend quite some time leveling up.  ---  --- In addition to inside battle, outside battle is just as interesting in dungeons.  You'll often come across sealstones.  When you pick them up they grant enhancements to your party.  They can be either positive or negative.  For example your strength could go up by grabbing one... and go down by grabbing another.  Carrying it puts the effect on your party.  However, you can also put the effect on your enemies by setting the stone on a dais.  Needless to say, you'll want to put the negative effects on your enemies... unless you're looking for a harder challenge than the game already is.  ---  --- Outside of dungeons and battles you can learn plenty of skills throughout the game.  When you buy equipment, you can link it together to give your characters special skills.  This is a lot of fun to play around with.  Although, it should be said, it gets tedious to set it up after a while.  The game shows you which skills you've created through your equipment, but there's no way for it to auto-equip with the stuff that gives you that skill.  At first this is no problem, but then as your characters start to build up and your list gets longer, it becomes a pain to set up all these skills again.  It comes down to way too much time in the menu when there shouldn't have to be.  ---  --- Valkyrie Profile 2 is overall a pretty satisfying game.  If you can get past the sluggish story (which really does turn out to be really good in the end) then you'll find yourself in love with this game.  It's different from the first one, but not so much that old fans will find themselves disappointed.  Actually it's quite the opposite.  If you liked the first game, then by all means, pick up this one.  ---  --- The Good ---  --- +An interesting story --- +Beautiful graphics --- +Excellent music score --- +Good voice acting --- +Large cast of playable characters --- +Interesting skill system --- +Just all out fun to play ---  --- The Bad ---  --- -The story is slow --- -Really steep difficulty level, a lot of the game will no doubt come from you spending time leveling up in dungeons before moving on --- -The skill system is interesting, but not being able to have your equipment auto-equip is really annoying when you've got a lot of characters and a lot of items in your inventory--equipping your characters shouldn't be a tedious chor
I Just want to make something clear...the windbreaker is NOT Prada, the tag reads MIU MIU, a very good brand, but definetely not Prada.  I found out it looks better when it is layered with a dark jacket.  I layered it with a black Yohi Yamamoto jacket and it looked just perfect... 
Reason once had two things going for it. It articulated principled libertarianism, and it was a consistently interesting magazine. Now its ideology is fuzzy; certainly not consistently libertarian. It is also dull and aimless, often badly written. Case in point: the current issue as I write includes a defense of the FDA by a writer who publically attacks prominent libertarians, and who works for an organization that supports a prohibition on the sale of nutritional supplements, as well as promoting state assaults on the tobacco industry. The "old" Reason would never have published such a piece.  Nor would Reason have previously published Ronald Bailey's article advocating mandatory health insurance. Bailey also supports the Iraq war and psychiatric coercion. A bright spot continues to be the writing of Jacob Sullum
I received these for christmas from my boyfriend (note to girls, only put things you really really want on your christmas list).  They work, we were able to change the oil in my volkswagen golf w/o scrapping or having any other catastrophic emergency.  the only bummer is that you can't stack them within each other for storage
It looks cool and I ordered one. It turns out a bad choice. The product is totally ineffective. Do not buy this unless you want to end up returning it like me
I use this watch both as a daily timepiece and for timing my runs. The ability to turn off the digital display gives it a refined look, even for an Ironman series. I like the catch incorporated into the watch band so it doesn't pull out of the guide (something that used to drive me crazy with my other watches). If you're looking for a sports watch that you can wear out on the town, this fits the bill.
Building on the Intuitive QuickBooks Pro interface and SQL database, QuickBooks Premier enables firms to scale - merely by clicking on a button and paying the difference. This ensures no work is lost. There is a whole new menu dedicated to specific Industries. While the estimate can have multiple options, when the customer places an order, the Sales Order function enables QuickBooks to saddle up for the ride. It generates Purchase Orders with the click of a button, and when goods are received, keeps track of who it is for. Invoices are generated from the sales order as well, and partial invoicing keeps track so I don't leave money on the table. I use the email function all the time, sending pdf attachments and cc:g myself so there's a time stamp.  ---  --- To address the problem of sharing large files, there is a new Portable Company File (much like a Zip file) which compresses files for emailing.  --- I have also grown to appreciate the online banking auto-reconciliation function - I log in to the bank every morning, and watch as transactions appear and then get matched with my books, leaving me only unreconciled transactions.  ---  --- QuickBooks also enables integration with third party software - there is a legion of industry specific solutions that help with core business operations. With 2006, QuickBooks has moved from being a software to a Business Operations System
Don't think Dale can play a song the same way twice. Didn't like the selection of songs nor  the  way they produced. --- 
when I went to use this product i didn't even have it  for a day and the antenna broke
I have been wearing Obsession® by Calvin Klein since it was first launched in 1985, the year I first arrived in California. It seems I am one of those people forever stuck in a time warp and prefer this classic instead of trying new scents. While I prefer the eau de parfum spray I have both variations. Although at first this tends to have a strong aroma, this doesn't last after being applied to your skin. I love the blend of vanilla, mandarin orange, peach and lemon that make up the scent of Obsession®. ---  --- My preference is more of a racy, provocative, alluring scent instead of brimming like flowers. With my skin irritations, asthma and allergies I have no problems with spraying my body parts with Obsession®. The color is quite appealing, reminding me of Spiced Rum with the brown, amber and gold tones. Obsession® cologne is suitable for both day and evening wear, indoors and outdoors and those luscious intimate settings.  ---  --- This is definitely a feminine scent, sweet, sexy and not too fruity or powerful.   There is a gold toned rim with the cap snapping on and pulling off most of the time with ease. Sometimes the lid does not go on just right and then the cap part becomes undone and this makes two pieces. ---  --- Once the scent has set in for awhile on my skin I detect a hint of floral with wood combination and have read on fragrance.net that Obsession® has oriental spices. It really is a winning combination that has captured my interest over the years. This is a scent that is recognizable by men and women and can be worn through out the seasons.  ---  --- I would not say this is a musk scent but more of a spicy tingle that needs to be only administered once a day for long lasting appeal. The appeal of Obsession® seems to run from girls in their early twenties to those of us in our early forties, from conservative ladies to party animals.  ---   --- Although it is a darker color than most fragrances, there is no staining on clothing, but I do not wear sweaters, whites or turtlenecks. When I do use the glass jar I have noticed frequently when standing over the sink the yellowish/brown tint left in the sink and have to rinse it off as well as my finger tips.  ---  --- Obsession® is a potent and romantic perfume for evening. The prices of the assorted sizes of Obsession® range from forty to sixty dollars.  --- 
Talk about junk! No search capability, mislabeled cds, some cds won't run - in short, YUK!
Buyers be aware that the picture does not show the correct shoe. The real shoe has an ankle strap. Also, the shoe seemed to run a half size smaller. I had to return the shoe and lose out on shipping costs
I bought this shopping cart for my 14 month old daughter who absolutely loves her Little Mommy doll.  She enjoyed taking the food out of the shopping cart but when she tried putting it back in the basket fell off the frame and she got quite upset.  Also, at her age it is difficult to get the doll into the seat portion without assistance from mom.  The cart itself also does not turn well when tried to walk with it
This set was one of the most fun builds I've done with Lego in a long time. As an adult fan of Lego, I highly recommend this set for its minifigures and part selection. They are excellent additions to any castle or general builder. As a builder, the final construction is impressive in size (18+ inches long), functionality (the rotisserie chicken is quite amusing), and playability (the sea serpent's posability and the incredible catapult alone are stunning). The catapult was my favorite part. After seeing the necrotic firing action of the Lego Exo-force Mobile Defense Tank's disk launcher; the rapid-fire, long-range Viking catapult is astonishingly fun to play with. The lone drawback in this set is the fragility of the ship's hull. It should be assembled on a hard surface (I tried to build it on carpet) and slid about on the floor, not carried (it will fold in half in the air). A few extra plate elements to reinforce the hull joints would probably improve this set
I have very sensitive skin and this product does not irritate by the end of the as other products have.  Also my coloring is very fair, red hair and blue eyes, even with brown/black mascara I always looked a little off-matched.  The brown in this line is a beautiful color and looks more natural than any I have ever used.  The ease of removal is the icing on the cake
Was using DataManager, but disliked the constant disk access in background.  Acronis backs up well without constant background disk access, and uses less disk space
I personally like this compilation of Prince, it's got most of the songs I like and the sound is great. Sure, there could have been a few more songs included, like "Pop Life", "Hot Thing", but when compared to the other compilations, this disc has more of the songs that are a must-have, for me, such as "I Wanna Be Your Lover", which I don't think was included on any of the other compilations. So, it's just a matter of weighing what songs you most want, so that's why I chose this disc and I'm glad I did! 
This is the best waffle mix you can buy. I was able to purchase this at Publix for years then it became hard to find. I had to purchase from a online seller buy the case. Not a problem-freezes well for over a year in box. The packs are two to a box-five waffles to a pack(min.). Add blueberries and you have yourself a great breakfest. All other store brand Belgian Waffle mix offered in every store chain pale in comparsion. The person that said this was awful... a few ideas. Heat the water you add for 1 minute in microwave- this makes the dough rise for fluffy waffles-then do the same for the butter you add to the mix ( this adds moisture to the dough) stir in blueberries and everyone here asks for seconds. My husband eats breakfest in Amsterdam six times a month and he has never complained nor made comparisions about these waffles- nothing but excellent taste with a real hint of malt flavoring. --- Some math- National Breakfest Chain $7.00 for one Belgian Waffles or 10 waffles for $3.79 plus the cost of the blueberries- how can you beat that! Don't forget the fresh whipped cream
I quote from GLIMPSES OF THE DEVIL, p. 215: "...after spending a half hour with that book, GODS' MAN. I called [a nun, six years my senior, who has been my spiritual director for more than twenty-five years] sobbing with a complex of emotions, including hatred for the author, disgust at the book, rage at its destructiveness, sorrow for all the other young boys and girls who had been the book's victims, and a feeling of deep contamination that I had received just from looking at it. After we spoke, I sent her my newly purchased copy and she called me back to agree that it was the single most destructive thing she had ever seen in her fifty-plus years." Undoubtedly, Dr. Peck's strong emotional reaction was due to the destruction the book wrought in the life of one of Peck's patients. But now you are forewarned
I really like the size and weight of the camera.  It is very easy to use and the picture quality is pretty good.  I had to return the cam because the motor noise is unacceptable.  I recorded some scenes while skiing and the whiny noise is very noticeable, even outdoors.  All the other reviewers claiming the cam records motor noise are dead on.  I will spend a bit more money and get the Sony HCR-DC96 instead
This grill is the greatest for simplicity and ease of use. It is compact and portable, so there is no unsightly grill always hanging around  your house or patio. I use it in summer and winter, and even set it up in the snow. If you do charcoal grilling exclusively, as I do, this grill has the flexibility to adjust the combustion air and exhaust to suite what you are cooking. For high temperatures, such as for steaks, I leave the top cover off. Takes perhaps 5 to 6 grillings before one learns all the right charcoal loadings and vent adjustments necessary. Cools off totally in 15 minutes if you close all vents.
I got this Weather Station last Christmas and have had a few problems with it. ---  --- 1. The Wind Gauge reads low. During Hurricane Katrina the maximum recorded reading was 28MPH versus gusts of 75MPH. The trees can be bent over from the wind and it reads 5MPH. ---  --- 2. The unit will just stop transmitting from the outside unit to the base unit. We have changed the batteries in the outside unit 4 times in the past year but continue to have this problem. Better than 50% of the time now nothing works from the outside unit. The range is now down to less than 50ft from the base station. I don't want to move the station any closer to the house because the wind and rain sensors will be impacted. ---   --- 3. The rain gauge does not update very often and it reads significantly lower than the local weather station. It rained heavy last night and the local news reported 1 inch of rain but we recorded 0.2 inches.  ---  --- 4. The barometric pressure appears to work well.  ---  --- There are better buys out there like the Oregon Scientific WMR968 that have a real 330 ft range so save your money
This is the first baby monitor we've tried and we are quite happy with it.  We did a good bit of research ahead of time and chose this one because of its features and the reliability.  I like that the receiver unit can plug into the wall.  I don't really like to use the voice-activated mode but my husband does and says it works great.  When in the normal mode, I can hear little birds outside my baby's window and cars passing our house; it's quite sensitive!  I also like the lights on the receiver; you can turn the volume all the way down if you're watching a movie or something
This is a great walker. The tray has plenty of activities to keep the little one busy and the music steering wheel and button lights can easily be removed to make the tray even bigger. My grandson just loves the walker and I do too because it gives him the freedom to move from place to place safely. Amazon sells model #14570, so don't worry, the walker is sturdy with locking wheels for when you prefer him to stay stationary. Also, a plus is that it converts into a walk behind walker which assists the child learning to walk
Jack London needs to be given his proper due. He is a tremendously talented writer and his understanding of life matches his tremendous knowledge of the snow-enshrouded world of the upper latitudes. Although The Call of the Wild is a short novel and on the surface a dog's story, it contains as much truth and reality of man's own struggles as that which can be sifted from the life's work of many other respected authors.  ---  --- Jack London's writing is beautiful, poignant, and powerful, yet also somber, morose, and infinitely real. London doesn't paint pretty picture, nor is the story elevating or uplifting. As an animal lover, I found parts of this story heartbreaking from Buck's removal from the civilized Southland in which he reigned supreme among his animal kin to the brutal cold and even more brutal machinations of hard, weathered men who literally beat him and whipped him full of lashes.  ---  --- Even sadder are the stories of the dogs that fill the sled's traces around him. Good-spirited Curly never had a chance, while Dave's story is only made bearable because of his brave, undying spirit. Even Spitz, the harsh taskmaster, has to be pitied, despite his harsh nature, for the reader knows this harsh nature was forced upon him by man and his thirst for riches. Buck's travails are long and hard, but it is his nobility of his spirit that makes of him a hero, despite the primitive animal instincts and urges that dominate him. Buck not only conquers the weather, the harshness of the men, the other dogs and the wolves he comes into contact with, he thrives.  ---  --- Hopes for redemption with John Thornton are dashed in the end, and that's when Buck finally gives in fully to "the call of the wild," becoming a creature of nature only. While this is a sad ending, the reader also feels joy and satisfaction at Buck's refusal to surrender and his ability to find his own kind of happiness in the harsh world in which he is placed
Unfortunately, the pockets are small, the fabric is poor quality, the seams already have started to split after wearing it twice. ---  --- Overall poor quality.  I would not recommend these scrubs.  I personally will never buy from this company again. ---  --- On a more positive note, they did get the right size and shipped promptly
I bought this right before my daughter was born and have used it every day since she was born 4 months ago. A week ago it just stopped working. I really liked this steamer and it had served me well but now was just not turning on anymore. So I went out and bought the exact same steamer. I used it for 2 days and then on the third day, yesterday, it wouldn't turn on anymore. I'm taking it back today and getting something else
I love these products however, this particular candle does not have the same, intense scent as previous candles I've purchase
Just bought a SONY T9 in Tokyo last April 10,2006 (7 months ago). --- And suddenly 2 weeks ago, the screen went dim practically can not see anything. ---  --- The power on / off also not working. All happened at the same time. --- Try to repair at SONY service station in Shanghai as I am residing there for the moment. ---  --- Very indifferent customer service staff refuse to repair, despite that I do have a world wide guarantee card and the receipt from the Tokyo shop as well as the complete boxes. ---  --- The SONY people there are really not helpful at all. ---  --- Most probably we suspect, they don't want to shoulder the cost for repairing under guarantee from SONY worldwide. --- It is shameful for such a big name like SONY. ---  --- Definitely, I will not buy again from SONY. Change to Olympus for the replacement and also cancel my BRAVIA LCD purchase. ---  --- I do not recommend buying goods from SONY as you  might have the same experiences (poor hardware quality and services)
This movie made no sense to me whatsoever. it wasn't really funny and it wasn't scary. the only thing that i got was that he killed Zombies or "Returners" as he called theme. and was upssed with one. i have to admit the female lead in the film was hot. but that was the only good thing in the film. it was also boring. but if you are into forgin fright films this is the movie for you
I am never happy when a purchase requires that you install the company's software.  The vid is encrypted so that you need Amazon's player to view it.  Blah.  You're better off buying the DVD for $20 with all the episodes so at least you can watch the DVD somewhere other than your own computer. 
wood chips, and this Rotisserie you are missing one of the great pleasures in life. ---  --- Well made and built to last years... --- 
This thing was such a waste.  It does not get cold enough to do anything.  It also won't stay flat against your face to give any soothing sensation to your eyes. Overpriced and worthless item
I bought my Harvey toy a while ago, and I was quite pleased. It's actually very durable, like everyone else has said. The crane doesn't break off, no matter how often you play with it or how hard you may accidentaly step on it. I think the only way to break it off is via steam roller. ---  --- Anyway, highly recommended for any Thomas collector
I am an amateur indian chef.  This spice is one of my favorite spices to use when I am cooking.  It is such a versatile spice, adding an exquisite flavor to any and all dishes.  It works well with a lot of different foods.  If you are in any way interested in cooking Indian, get this spice....NOW!!!!!
Ok...received this item last night...used once, and in the process realized I was pointing a laser beam on my skull.  Given the directions say 3 times a week, 15 minutes per, I would have to do this for a long time with no proven results...Save yourself the time...do this...Go to google and type in "Forum and HairPro".  You will find next to nothing regarding information for this product.  I made an impulse purchase getting sucked in to the exploitation...after further research even the top rated hairmaxx brush selling for $500 has mixed results on the online forums.  Not to mention that Viatek had spelling errors in the pamphlet that came with the product...If they don't have the time to make sure all is spelled right in the manual, how much time did they spend creating the actual product.  The box had a date of 2005 and there was dust all over it.  These lasers may work, but with all the research I did (after the purchase) results seem minimal for all the work that needs to be done.  I felt ridiculous using the thing too.  I am just annoyed because again I got sucked into a new gimmick for something that companies can exploit in individuals. 
Does not consistently work! I have a toshiba a15 (Win XP Pro) and sometimes this works, but usually it doesn't. Lately, it either works perfectly or it gives me a blue screen error and restarts the computer. It used to have problems where i would restart the computer and it would say card not found, which forced me to reload the driver. But lately it's just been giving me a blue screen. I have used PCMCIA cards before and never once had any issues. --- D-Link needs to support their faulty product with a new driver! Bad customer service! --- I WILL NEVER BUY A D-LINK PRODUCT AGAIN!!
way to easy to install! I had it installed and working in a few short minutes, if your looking for a new hoen to replace those little mortercycle type horns they put in cars these days than this is the one you want. Mind you this is not the real loud awsome toned air horns you find on big trucks but it is good enouph to scare the heck out of a moron that cuts you off :-) --- Highly recomend these for the price! Great value
I've had this camera for three years.  I bought it new, when it was cutting edge and very expensive.  I put a 128MB CF card in it. ---  --- First, I have to say that I have NEVER had the slightest problem with this camera or the software.  I've probably taken upwards of 5000 pictures with it, it's been all over the country.  The software has been installed on Windows 95, 98, 2000 and XP and I haven't had any problems with it.  The camera is solid, performs well, takes good pictures, and the battery lasts pretty long if you disable the LCD viewfinder. If battery life were that big a deal, one could purchase a second battery and rotate. ---  --- All that said, I am a little disappointed with the quality of the pictures from the camera.  They are razor sharp, the color balance is perfect, and the focus is great.  When taking pictures of people, however, it shows EVERY flaw in the subject's skin.  Scratches, oil, freckles are magnified and come out looking horrific.  It requires extensive Photoshopping to fix the flaws.  Other cameras taking pics of the same subjects turn out looking much better.   ---  --- I will also say that it takes a very long moment for the camera to do its digital image processing between the time you press the button and when the camera actually takes the picture. By the time the shot's taken, something (especially a squirmy child or a sports play) has invariably moved and it's not the exact picture you wanted. ---  --- I'm going to buy a real Single-Lens Reflex (SLR) to take baby pictures, but I'll keep this as a travel camera
Lightweight, high-quality construction. We are very pleased with it, and our 1.5yr girl just loves it.  The carrying strap is a very convenient addition. Don't waste your money on a $20 umbrella stroller, spend a little more and enjoy the high quality of this excellent stroller
very very not user friendly.... no instruction to install. worked after it got installed but doesnt work with the wireless internet in my house. Decided to resell it. could be its only because i'm apple-illeterate...
We are pleased with our recent purchase.  We were surprised that it came through the US mail service. It did have a broken part that we believe is used on the cord to open the umbrella. --- 
I am glad I purchased my Cardscan 700, but there are some significant unfortunate missed opportunities and because of that some important functions cannot be done at all.  My impression is that this is the best product on the market, due to its scanning properties, which are quite good.  There are some serious deficiencies though in the rest of the software which would be nice to have fixed, and which in some cases render the device somewhat useless, since the output cannot be transferred to a useful place. ---  --- PROs: It does a pretty good job of scanning.  The algorithm is well developed and is actually quite impressive.  Even cards that catch and rotate as they go through, producing a funny smeared image, have some of their contents scanned correctly.  The superiority of this recognition software is the strong point of this product.  There is also an ok database management product that one can use to maintain and look up cards.  Operationally the product is especially nice- I can just sit there feeding cards in and typing carriage return after each one, glancing at the screen to catch errors.  The card image is retained in the record in the Cardscan database, which is important.  ---  --- CONs: 1) the exit path has places that cards can hang up, and they can catch as they go through.  This happens fairly often unless the card is new and flat, so part of the operation is to try to prevent that, by straightening out bent corners ahead of time, and by adding a little force keep the card from catching and rotating as one corner goes forward and the other is stuck.  Quite needless- if the exit path was smooth and continuous, this wouldn't happen - the problem is in the rear of the plastic case.  2) Although the product retains the image of the business card, there's no way to pass that through to Outlook or export it to any other format.  This is very unfortunate.  I could laboriously do that by hand by cutting and pasting each one, except that Cardscan software does not permit copy / paste functions on the image.  Why not?  It's easy to implement.  3) Every time I start the program it harasses me about registering, even though I've been specific that I do not wish to.  It also harasses me about logging in the online backup facility even though I've asked it not to do that.  It therefore ignores the user wishes.  4) The data exchange function allows only extremely crude export to a file, in a simple text or csv format.  There is no way to create an Outlook format .pst file, which would simplify importing, and allow for the future option of including an image.  Outlook can hold an image in the comment section of the record, but apparently Cardscan folks aren't even close to thinking about this.  5) If I indicate that a data export for a file is destined for Outlook, the field names are not set up correctly, so unless I do some heavy editing of field names, nothing much other than the contact name gets across.  If I export directly to the running Outlook program, it isn't perfect, but it's close enough to be usable.  Why did Cardscan get one right and not the other??  In neither case can I send the card image over.  6) I was forced to install Microsoft .NET software even though I intended to do all my exports via files.  I didn't get a choice- if I didn't install .NET, the installer stopped and exited without installing any Cardscan software.
A very nice thermometer, very simple to use, to read and pretty accurate for a thermometer of this price; at least it is more accurate than the local weather company.  Made in China, try to don't drop it.  Something that could be kind of annoying is that every 3 seconds the LCD will display the hour and after those 3 seconds will display the temperature, if it doesn't botter you (like me) you should buy it. I tested it in temperatures from 15°C to 25°C and works fine.  1 year warranty in the US and Canada
This Is as Bad as The Film.in Fact Just Like The FIlm The Soundtrack is the same old Formula.Will&His Movies&Music Never change the same Old Beat.The Rest Of The Soundtrack is just as  bad.UNORIGINAL&BORING.What A Waste of KOOL MOE DEE
Well sometimes it pays to take a chance.  After reading a negative review of these tongs I went ahead and bought them anyway...I do love Steven Raichlen's show and his books. Well, either I have a disagreement with the earlier review or they fixed 'em.  These tongs work great, are very heavy duty for handling big slabs of meat like I like to cook, and the extra length keeps my hands cool without gloves.  I vote 5 stars. Keep on BBQ'ing
This is a must have for anyone with an R&B "oldies" collection. You won't be disappointed
After leaving (or being dismissed from) Pink Floyd in 1968 due to his LSD use & erratic behaviour, singer/songwriter/guitarist Syd Barrett re-emerged in 1970 with his debut solo album, "The Madcap Laughs." The album did not come easy, as Syd never fully recovered from his drug use, and it clearly shows in his ragged performances on "Madcap Laughs." Producer Malcolm Jones did what he could with Syd for about half of the album, before handing the production reigns over to Barrett's former Floyd mates Roger Waters & David Gilmour to finish the job. Throughout the album, bum notes are played, beats are missed, and Barrett sings off-key. And on the rocker songs, the session players (from the group The Soft Machine) sound like they are struggling to keep up with Syd, who could hit a rough patch at any moment. For any other artist, this would all be nothing short of disastrous. And YET....in the case of Syd Barrett, any and all mistakes are immediately forgiven. Why? Because Barrett's songs on "The Madcap Laughs" are all wonderfully written, and although Syd's voice and guitar-playing are obviously not in tip-top condition, you can plainly hear on this album that he's trying. He's really, really *trying* to do his best, and his efforts really do shine through. For every bum note there's a passage that Syd plays beautifully, for every missed beat there are many beats that are hit right on schedule, and for every note that Syd sings off-key, there are many moments where his very distinctive, British voice is magical. And of course, there's Syd's lyrics. You may not know what all of them actually *mean*, really, but to my ears, they're still poetry. The rockers are still powerful ("No Good Trying," "No Man's Land," the rockabilly fun of "Here I Go," and the classic "Octopus"), and the softer numbers still have great beauty to them ("Terrapin," the passionate "Dark Globe," the effective "Golden Hair"---based on a James Joyce poem---and "Long Gone"). Even the more ragged numbers like "Feel" and "If It's In You," somehow still hang together quite well (amusingly, we even hear some brief banter from Syd in the middle of "If It's In You," as his voice goes wildly off the map, he stops playing, prepares for another take, and finally gets through the song). When all is said and done, "The Madcap Laughs," warts and all, is an excellent album. It is a flawed masterpiece, and it shows that Syd Barrett, even with his mind irreversibly fractured by this point, was still a genius musician.   
I bought Calvin Klein For Women parfum as a Christmas gift to my sister. To see the smile on her face at Christmas when she opened her gift, was priceless. As for the cost, it was much less than the department stores at the local mall's. Thank you Amazon for a great deal!
I got the Canon CP400 printer a while back so I could make the occasional print to hand out (or put silly captions on "bad" Christmas party photos). ---  --- I don't know how the printer manages to keep the image aligned as the paper goes in and out 4 times (yellow, magenta, blue, and the clear coat) but when it drops it out, I have a pretty nice print, complete with address lines and a stamp outline on back (plus Canon logo of course) - suitable for mailing as a postcard. About 1/2" of each end gets removed  after printing as it is used for traction of the rubber roller in the printer. ---  --- I frequently print 3 shots vertically on a 4 x 6 card as sort of a mini proof sheet. I've also used the 4 x 8 size to print 2 side by side. ---  --- Fun stuff
I don't understand the 1 star reviews, unless there is some product variability.  Price was $60 at Target.  Talk time is OK, although the longest I have been on the phone is maybe 10 or 15 minutes.  Range is fine.  Phone works all over the house, and audio quality if fine
This movie is far from being anything great. Some of the characters don't make any sense what so ever with the original cast. Leatherface's role has been mocked. People spend too much time focusing on the other people rather than build up Leatherface. The first TCM is a classic. And the second TCM is great as well. But Leatherface: TCM III, The Next Generation, and the TCM remake have all made the Texas Chainsaw Massacre franchise a laughing stock. I really hate new directors coming into the horror scene just to mess it up. The only thing they do these days is make crappy remakes and fill horror movies up with CGI. Enough is enough.
I think this is the best version to come out yet. I would have a high end pc if I was to upgrade only software. I would just wait and buy a new pc. Its alot easyer then learning a new operating system and if you enable the adminstrator account and only use your standard accounts to surf the web then it give you some security. The firewall is good in the business versions and there is some good virus software out there. Its got alot more features and run's good's. Device drivers are easyier to load -scott 
My 1 1/2 year old son really enjoys this toy. he loves putting the little men on top.  He doesn't play with the toys on the side, guess thats for younger kids, but he does enjoy the shape sorter and the drawbridge opening is cute and holds his attention.  I find an advantage over the classic Fisher price is that he can't as easily just rip the cover off and toss the pieces in when he gets frustrated.  At this age, I find the Alphabet pieces a waste and wish there were more shapes to sort.  Perhaps when he's older he'll enjoy the letters as well, but I doubt he'll still be interested.  Overall, cute toy that holds his attention while many do not.  Main drawback is that there are only 4 shapes to sort
Please careful about this Grooming Kit. I bought one week before and when I turn on first time it did not work and plug the power it did not work. This product just missed the simple logic when i connected to power adapter why should it has to use battery power to work instead it should directly work with power adapter regardless of battery charged or not. This lag of simple feature make me wait for 2 hours to charge before i use it at that time my kid started to cry as i try to trim his hair. Also this can not be used for continuous use, if you use for small trimming then you have to wait for the battery to charge
Bought this to convert PAL Hi-8 (Canon) purchased years ago in Singapore for Mac (PowerBook G4, Tiger OS-X) nonlinear editing. Worked perfectly the first time, only needed to set a single switch to select PAL. No need for software drivers etc. Happily plugged and played with the Mac and the camcorder. ---  --- Acceptable price for the features and ease of use.
This was a no brainer for my pregnant daughter!  When those cravings kicked in, she had plenty of treats!  Also used them for snacks with lunches.  Buy baggies to sort in individual serving sizes
Im a graphic design student in college, so i really needed a camera. I decided on this one and i am really glad i did. The pictures are nice and clean. The camera itslef is a very sleek looking one and is very compact. The only downfall to this is that it eats batteries pretty quick, but i just took them out when i wasnt using them. Buy this camera
My 14-month old daughter loves these snack cups. She can monitor her snack time, eating as much or as little as she needs. She loves carrying around a snack cup in one hand and a sippy cup in the other.  ---  --- The only reason I give it 4 stars, is because she has a tendency of keeping her hand in the flaps while walking around. This makes single Cheerios fall out here and there. But, nothing compared to giving her snacks in an open bowl. I've only used them on Cheerios so I can't comment on other snacks (she tends to choke on Goldfish so she only gets those while sitting in the high chair). ---  --- She hasn't tried taking off the lid like other reviewers, so that's not a problem for us (at least not yet). We use them all the time and I definitely recommend them
I love this camera the first day I received it I took 3 rolls of film.  It has been the best purchase I bought this year. I got a real good price on it and i received it fast!
I have ordered this tux for my 18 months old son for my sister's wedding. It looked amazing!!! ---  --- The suit arrived timely and I couldn't believe how perfect they have prepared the whole package. All the details were well thought and the tux looked perfect with satin buttons, matching waist band and stripes on the side of the pants. Even the shirt is so well tailored.  ---  --- My son was very comfortable in the suit during the whole night and accepted more applouds than the groom! ---  --- I sincerely recommend this product
Turf Gear is initally marketed for use with football players, well I think the year Bill Clinton became President was the last time I donned shoulder pads, but it didn't stop me from being active later in life.  With Long Sleeve Turf Gear shirts from Under Armour, I was hoping that the product would live up to the description.  A long sleeve shirt that is skin tight, yet allows your skin to breath?  Material that wicks sweat away from the skin?  Sounded almost too good to be true, but I took a chance anyways. ---  --- So far I've used mine both hiking and cycling, with the latter getting so much use that I need to order more.  Despite the tightness of this shirt when you initially put it on, it stretches and breathes amazingly well.  I was a little leery with the two size charts and actually used Amazon's instead of the actual retailer who was selling the Under Armour product (Fogdog) and ended up just fine.  Works great for working out or any number of outdoor type activities which is what I use mine for.  Bottom line is that it breathes and stretches well, and is very comfortable.  I must also add that after several washings and even a bad spill while cycling, these shirts are amazingly durable!  I feel the price is definitely worth it, excuse me while I go order more
the munch'ems were certainly a good buy. they taste great and easy to pack. best of all they are good for you too.
I have thick, wavy hair and this product did nothing but make it feel wirey and frizzy. I don't think it is worth the money when I have found other poducts (such as Redken) that work better and cost less
This is an absolutely wonderful product.  The CD Player in my Cadillac was skipping tracks and was a mess.  One use of this cleaner (specially for cars) and my player was good as new
This was a gift . It came on time and was half the price of one we had looked at . So we were happy 
This is a really nice remake of a great classic (FFIV).  They improved the dialogue, and added in a lot of great items.  The challenge level, however, was bumped up significantly.  The game was originally paced so you didn't have to spend nearly as much time leveling up.  A few of the bosses surprised me this time through (I've played the SNES version multiple times in my day).  The story is unchanged, however.  A must have for any FF/Classic RPG fan!  As a bonus, I finally got to play Chrono Trigger
I ordered the HappyLite about 4 months before they even shipped the product, because it was the first reasonably priced (and sized) light to help treat SAD.  Living in Minnesota, I tend to get depressed in February, so wanted to see if the light would help. Starting in Oct/Nov 2003, I began turning it on at desk height at my work for the suggested amount of time. I did not use it on weekends. --- Anyway, I think that it helped me keep from sinking so low with the SAD blues in February, but it did not completely keep SAD away. I spent 4 days on the beach in Florida during the 3rd week of February, and that helped the most. --- I will indeed use the light again this winter, because it helps--but does not eliminate--SAD for me
The retro-slinky dog, however cute, just doesn't work.  We have tried it on the hardwood floor, the carpet, the title.  We have tried tying a string arounds it's neck, adding a string to it's short stubby string, using the short stubby string to pull it but nothing works.  Our kids 2 & 6 just drag it around laying on it's side--it's just not fun--the head is too heavy and it doesn't move well at all.  I would not buy it.  the Fisher Price doggy we got is very cute and it stays upright, it walks with you and the pull-string is a good length--plus it's cute too!! 
My child LOVES Geotrax and plays with them everyday.  However, Big City Lights makes your track look good but doesn't have much for a child to interact; the crane has a crank to turn but the bricks are hard to get to stick in the clamp and besides a button for sounds that is about all this has to offer.  Unlike other pieces with Geomotion this one is a bore.  My child rarely plays with this piece except to watch the RC trains go under it.
I'm in the midst of auditioning LCD panels and the local ISF certified guy wants $350 per panel to calibrate them. I like TV and everything, but there's just no way that I am going to spend $350 on TV that I might possibly keep.  ---  --- Still, the store settings on any two panels have two problems. First, they are amped up beyond compare as the TV vendors compete to be "who's the brightest" on the lit showroom floor. Sitting in my living room, they are far far too bright to watch. Second, they display colors totally differently. It's just hard to compare to 2 sets that are calibrated so differently. ---  --- Now the TVs that we are looking at cost a pretty penny, and it seemed that a couple of hundred dollars to inform the decision was a good idea, just like the hundred dollars for an HDMI splitter seemed like a good idea. The splitter was a good idea, the Spyder TV Colormeter not so much. ---  --- I calibrated 2 panels with this product. Two things are true about the calibrations. First, they do not look at all the same. The Sony panel has red shifted flesh tones while the Sharp looks cold and sterile. Second, they look way way worse than before the calibration. After 20 minutes of watching Casino Royale, it was time to revert back to a toned down version of the factory defaults for each. ---  --- At first I thought that I had not followed the instructions right. Maybe it was not dark enough. Maybe the sensor was not positioned right. Having done the process several times, I can state categorically that while the colorvision Spyder TV may not deliver good results, it is consistent in its delivery of bad results.  ---  --- I simply cannot recommend this product
DELICIOUS, CAN'T TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN REGULAR PASTA AND THIS PRODUCT, EXCEPT I AM LOSING WEIGHT, SO IT MUST NOT BE AFFECTING MY BLOOD SUGAR

I went through a painful final separation from the love of my life when this CD was released in 1997, and I identified with every song.  I listened to this CD over and over for several months.  I saw Kim at the "House of Blues" in Hollywood during that time and sang along to every song.  This CD is my favorite "bitter sweet" CD of all time.  I love you, Kim
The card worked fine for my son's graduation and a family holiday but became corrupted during my brother's wedding and I lost all the photos from that event.  I still can't believe it happened.  If you have an iPod, or other, remember to back-up your photos as soon as you can to try and avoid this
After reading a couple of other reviews about the "quality" of transfer on this dvd, I decided I wanted this in my collection. What I THOUGHT would be good or atleast a decent enough picture quiality, I WAS VERY DISSAPOINTED.THE QUALITY OF TRANSFER OF THE PICTURE IS HORRIBLE!!! A great movie a total real diaster flick in picture quality. Non anamorphic, deffintaly not remastered or digitally transfered. Picture tones are very, very bad, along with what little color that is desplayed. Almost a black & white picture with most of the entire movie too dark to make out what is going on. Even with my brightness turn all the way up on my tv, it still was so dark it almost wasn't worth continue watching.The ONLY things positive on this dvd was the fact it was in widescreen and "suppossedly" in Dolby Digital EX. The beginning Dolby intoduction was deffinatly in Dolby and had good sound but the movie itself didn't distributeand Dolby sounds that I could make out on my theatre sound system. Sounded like mono to me.Thsi dvd reproduction stinks and I suggest those that are into quality dvd and getting you money worth saty away from this "Goodtimes Video" version untill it is put on dvd correctly. Why they botherd is beyond me. Because I wanted to have a copy of this movie in widescreen, I am taping it on to VHS for my collection and going to try and return it for something better tommorrow. I suppsoe I'll have to be content that I got the widscreen version on VHS for now untill they re-release it on dvd with better quality, or they show it on tv in widescreen which I highly doubt. Heck, even TAPING IT OFF TV YOU'D GET A BETTER PICTURE QUALITY THAN THIS DVD
You'll never read this in NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC, and NG is all the poorer for it.  P.J. O'Rourke is never politically-correct and he visits places on the planet from which most people would like to escape...the result is a spot on, razor sharp, keenly observed travelogue that is side-splittingly funny, in a tragic sort of way.  O'Rourke has a wonderful way of spotting irony, silliness, and official absurdity, and letting all of the air out of pompous, ill-conceived notions.  In short, he is the UN's worst nightmare.  For anyone who has travelled or ever interacted with any government agency anywhere--especially our own--this book is a must read
this book sucked. all the other people in my book group and I hated this book. there is only a stupid plot about a pig running awa
If you've missed your favorite pastas because of your low-carb diet, this definitely is the product for you. Though it doesn't have the starchy quality of pasta, it's a convincing substitute if you're don't mind sacrificing texture for a low-calorie, low-carb meal. Be sure to drain adequately before you top with a sauce, otherwise you end up with a slimy mess. Otherwise, I would recommend this product to anyone who misses pastas because of Atkins, South Beach, etc.
This book is as much about life as it is about baseball. The positive re-enforcement the book gives about accomplishing almost anything is the true message. --- Whenever you or one of your players is struggling, go back to this book to refresh a slumping attitude
The Back to Nature Graham Sticks, Honey are delicious! They are a great tasty snack. There's no way you can eat 'em without a cup of milk. Not because they're rich, but they're a little on the dry side. I still like them so much that I quit buying them at the supermarket & started buying them in bulk [...
That about says it all.  This cereal is just too sweet.  Their Flax cereal is better
This is a first person account of a trip to the arctic in the 1860's narrated by a Civil War deserter.  Within the first few pages, our hero enlists, pilfers letters off battlefield corpses, deserts, is injured in NYC draft riots, ends up in New Bedford, MA and signs up on a sailing ship without ryhme or reason or knowing where it was going.  The book was downhill from there. ---  --- Page after page described ice and the crew's interminable struggles to get through.  Getting through the book was nearly as interminable. ---  --- The reader never gets to know the narrator enough to empathize with him, or really understand him at all.  Thus, his struggles ring hollow and he evokes no sympathy during his struggles. ---  --- There are elements of fantasy in the book.  Not enough to make it a fantasy, but enough to steer a reader off course.  The scientist on the mission is after a warm Garden of Eden in the middle of the Arctic.  He is mad or it's fantasy, it is hard to know until the end.  There is a fantasy interlude when a character who has three hands (the most likeable character in the book) describes how he got his third hand.  From that yarn comes the title "Rope Eater".  The title really has nothing to do with the book, other than rope eaters and the crew members suffered pain. ---  --- Besides the tedious turning of the plot, the characters lack any development.  Only the three handed man and the captain, both tangential characters, had any depth whatsoever. ---  --- This book seemed to be an attempt at adventure, but not enough happened between the interminable accounts of ice to build much tension.  It never developed the aspect of the deterioration of the characters - mentally and physically - it just happened.  Although the reader knew the characters must be suffering, it never came through the over-writing. ---  --- As one might expect, the crew's mission to find the warm Garden of Eden in the arctic was pointless.  So was this book.  It was a disappointment. --- 
This is great.  It makes it easier for us all to listen to the music in the car
Arrived in 4 days.  Best price I've found.  Flavorful coffee
The sweet taste was excessive and unpleasant.  I thought it was not fresh tasting.  The picture is deceiving because each fruit is cut in half and you get the top half only.  Other Marzipan is the entire round shape of the fruit. I am glad that I only bought the small size since I ended up throwing this purchase in the trash
This game is awesome. I love to play it, and i play it everyday. In school it gets me way far ahead, and much quicker too at math. The only thing that puts the game at a rate of overall 4 stars is that in one of the games you have to speak out, and sometimes it won't take your answer. this happens sometimes, but it kind of stinks because your getting tested, so when it won't take it it counts it as wrong. But i gotta say don't let this little thing stop you from buying this game. It will kill alot of time. On long trips i always take it, and whenever i get to my destination im like man i spent over two hours playing the ds? It totally rocks! i used to get car sick because i was bored, and just sitting in the car, but now i don't get car sick at all, because im doing something else. This game has made me good, and quick at math in my school. It really helped. This game is definitely good for all ages even my dad plays it!
I bought this because a few people had put it in their Amazon lists.  I just didn't like it at all.  It is one of those albums where you play it, and you don't take notice of it until the CD stops playing.  It is very old and the music is simplistic.  Cool cover though
we placed the receiver in our lower deck as we don't have a door bell there...the sensor we placed at the gate at the top of the stairs..when some one opens the gate we can hear it in our spa room  ..  it works great and gives a sense of privacy.
After spending over $30 for this item, we used it only twice and it ripped on the bottom clear across.  A seamstress said it could not be repaired and commented that the fabric was not very durable or strong.  Would not purchase again or recommend to others
I'm more or less fine that they changed a murder with an object in a room to who ate the cake at what time with what beverage.  Buying this for kids and all that.  Its not as intuitive or intrinsicly interesting, at least to me, but hopefully it is to kids.  However, they also changed the mechanics of the game from adult Clue, and not in a good way.  The "room" variable for example, drops out.  Its not relevant.  Its who ait the cake at what time with what drink.  It just feels silly to set up the room pieces and move from room to room if the room is irrelevant.     ---  --- The idea is probably to change the mechanics to make the game simpler.  Well, the problem with that is it was pretty simple in the first place.  And the change sort of makes it more complex in a way.  You need to remember the rooms where you already checked tokens.  Now the sheet does list the rooms, you could use that to check off the rooms where you checked tokens.  But since the rooms are not otherwise relevant, its not intuitive to track the rooms where you checked tokens.   ---  --- The game is also incredibly cheaply constructed.  For example, the "die" does not have numbers on it, you have to put number stickers on it.  And the board isn't flimsy -- flimsy would be an improvement.   ---  --- Anyway, not recommended
This was inexpensive, attractive, excellent windbreaker. Only minor problem is a tiny bit too much fabric around the zippers so care must be taken to zip and unzip. 
This is a classic green tea that brews up to a pale amber liquor with a fine grassy scent. Savor this tea for a delicate and elusive experience. The taste is barley, sweet hay and the faintest herbal taste. The aftertaste is very mild and fresh. ---  --- Green tea is touted for its health benefits--not just antioxidants but also because it is supposed to help you lose weight!! Green tea averages about 10-30 mg of caffeine as opposed to 90 mg in a cup of coffee. Tazo does not put how much caffeine is in their tea on the box
At first I thought i wouldn't like this bra because it has to be pulled over you head to put it on. However, this is the most comfortable bra I bought, and I bought a lot of different kinds. This is perfect for engorgement and just plain daily comfort
To me the main problems with all headsets come on the receiving end and are either: --- a. Feedback loop:  Where the other person hears themself speak --- b. Ambient noise:  The other end hears everything around you, especially in a car ---  --- In minimizing these, the Mobile Freedom Bluetooth is the best.  I've tested my other 3 headsets with people on the same call and this one ranks the highest in voice clarity without extraneous noises. ---  --- As for me, I hear everyone fine on all the headsets, but a conversation is a two-way street and if you've ever used a headset, I'm sure you're tired of hearing, "Take me off that stupid thing!" ---  --- The negatives with this headset are far outweighed by the call clarity.  Yes, it's big and ugly, but your friends will thank you. ---  --- The other negative to be aware of (although I assume this is more due to the age of my headset as it's only recently started doing this) is that I've found is that after 1 year, while the battery still holds a charge well, it sometimes drops the link to the phone when I hang up after a call and I can't get it back until I recharge the thing.  Like I said, it's getting a bit old though. ---  --- Overall, if I was going to buy a new one, I'd get this one. ---  --- As far as the other 3 tested, I'll rank them in order of call quality (best to worst). --- Plantronics Discovery 655 (not too bad, but hard to keep in your ear) --- Jensen Stereo Headphones WBB100RX (more for wireless stereo headphones than for calling) --- Motorola HS850 (Looks cool, but a total piece of garbage) ---  --- p.s.  If you're wondering why I have 4 headsets it's because there's nothing worse than losing the use of one of your hands while talking on the phone.  1 for the car, 1 for the home, 1 for the... well you get the picture. --- 
After brushing with the HydraBrush, my teeth feel as clean as when I've been to the dental hygenist. --- This is a great product.  I am so glad that replacement brushes are available at Amazon
I really liked the watch as it looked in the picture. But, when I purchased it, I realized that its way too shiny. If you have a thin wrist, then the watch looks really bulky. Besides, the 12 o'clock mark on the watch is not exactly to the north. So, you have to tilt your head and make sense of the time... ---  --- I am going to return this watch..
This fit very easily into my daughter's Graco infant car seat.  As the other reviewers said, it is very convenient and keeps my daughter nice and warm.  Wind has not seemed to be a problem, but then I only carry her between the car and my destination in it.  I would recommend this to a friend
This magazine is all puff-- if you're looking for honest and insightful reviews, this is not your read.  However, if you already know all the artists they profile and just like pretty pictures of them, this magazine is worth buying for the sampler disc included with every issue
I bought these for my wife for Christmas 2005. By August 2006 one of them fell apart. The gold loop is attached to the white gold loop by a very tiny and fragile weld, which broke. It was not due to any abnormally rough handling. It would have cost $50.00 to have repaired. Now they're throw-aways
if you are a GHITS SAC fan this DVD is a must,  --- series wise the dvd contains 4 new episodes and the tachikoma stories are back as well, in fact the tachikoma's are now back in action in the series Too. Graphic wise, 2nd gig drops the funny pastel look of the first season and returns to its dark look as it was in the first movie, the CG is allot more fine-tuned and the action is awesome!!!, the opener has also improved significantly for the series!!!, Sound wise the series is awesome as usual 5.1 DTS Japanese & 5.1 DTS English, with stereo for both and there are English subtitles if you chose to run it with Japanese audio.  --- Overall they squealed SAC season 1 perfectly, this not a series to miss if you're a shell fan!   
I HAVE HAD ALL THE ANTI VIRUS PROGRAMS AND ZONE ALARM WORKS BEST. --- E. FIEL
I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY 3 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER. SHE LOVED IT IN THE STORE AND I THOUGHT IT WAS CUTE. I ALSO AGREE WITH THE OTHER REVIEWERS THAT THERE SHOULD BE INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE STICKERS, BUT YOU DON'T NEED TO BE A GENIOUS TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THEY GO. I CHOSE TO NOT SHAROEN THE PENCIL BECAUSE SHE IS 3 AND I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS NECESSARY. FOR TWENTY DOLLARS IT IS A GOOD BUY. I KNOW MY DAUGHTER LOVES IT AND IS HAVING A LOT OF FUN WITH IT
I like the unique style of this necklace, and received compliments on it when I wore it to work.  The price is reasonable for the type of necklace having such unique beads
i just purchased this album, my first misfits album and every song on it rocks (i especially like where eagles dare).  i just bought two more albums, walk among us and static age and i wish they would hurry up and get here in the mail because i cant wait.  my only complain is the sound quality.  it sounds like they put a dollar store tape recorder in the corner and started rocking...but i guess that makes it sound more real too.  metallica covered a couple of their albums on their garage album but it just isnt the same. 
B.O.B. Rocks. BOB is very high quality and has held up extremely well for us after nearly 2 years of use. We're a little attached to BOB in our house. Let me tell you the Revolution is the stroller to get. We bought it right after our baby was born, choked up $40 or so for the infant seat bar and have used it as our primary stroller ever since. Even in the mall, department stores, etc it's great. Baby gets a smooth ride and daddy likes it because it's agile and almost effortless to push. I see hundreds of Bugaboo strollers around and I must admit they are nice but B.O.B is my choice because of price and you can go more places with him.  ---  --- Our other seldom used stroller is a Graco something or other and I don't even know where it is. However I've used it enough to compare it to BOB when collapsing it and putting it in the car. I must say BOB is easier and faster to fold and go. ---  --- One downside might be that the storage compartment under the seat is smaller than some of those jumbo strollers. However, BOB is built like a tank. We travel with BOB a lot through airports (Yes BOB fits through most airport XRAY's while normally collapsed but sometimes I have to take off the back wheels which is easy) and we hang stuff off of BOB's handlebars and even carry our jumbo car seat on top of the sun shade until we get to our car. ---  --- Our family is now looking for a double or tandem stroller. This get's interesting because I don't see us doing the duallie BOB Revolution since it's a no-go in the mall, Target, etc. The Phil & Ted's E3 Buggy and Double Buggy are looking tempting but I don't like that the older child sits tucked behind the stroller.. They can't see anything. What I wish B.O.B. Corp would do is come up with an attachment to at least do the same as the Phil & Ted's..... But a tandem stroller that was a revolution would be sweet!
Somehow - this movie touched my heart and my mind - and I am sure if Ben and Matt could figure out exactly what their formula was they would do it everytime.  However - it just may be one of --- those once in a lifetime things - like first love - impossible --- to re-capture, and in a sense, haunting.  I am not obsessive in --- any way but I have watched this movie at least twenty times - --- with each time revealing another layer of meaning - and with the movie becoming a place where I sometimes go for comfort.   ---  --- The synergistic combination of outstanding actors in their best roles - maybe their best ever - in combination with simply a --- great story most definitely puts this movie in a special --- category - so buy it and watch it.  You'll be glad you did. ---  --- Mik
I love this product. In combination with diet and exercise I have lost about 5 pounds, and I wasn't heavy to begin with (all I wanted to do was tone up). Instead of taking the recommended dosage of 2 capsules twice a day, I am taking 1 twice a day. I figured I'd take it slow before I get too jittery. But it definitely curbs my appetite. I literally eat half of my usual intake. It gives me energy without making me feel like I'm wired and I haven't had any shaking hands. I only had headaches for the first 2 days I took this, but now they are completely gone. I will continue to take this even after I reach my goal weight. It's a great product.
I developed acne after I turned 23 and have had limited success using over the counter products. I purchased the acne kit and it began to clear up my skin, but I would still get the cysts that took for ever to go away or they would never get to the surface. I starting using the oxygen peel one a week and found that it wasn't doing much and that there was a lot of extra get that I had made that was wasted. I talked to the girl at the counter several days ago about this and I had a huge cyst that was very painful. She told my to use the oxygen peel 3 times in a row and that should help. I would be using all the extra gel that was made and would see more results.  --- I went home that night and did just as she said. I was amazed to see that the painful cyst had risen to the surface and I was able to relieve the pressure. This is a truely amazing product and would recommend it to anyone who has this same proble
Overpriced! Not what I expected! You can't really used it because it's too small for big bellied pregnant women! Uncomfortable! The velcro gets in the way of sleeping comfy. YUCk
it will not work in my Windows XP.  I have repeatedly asked for help;no one answers.  Finally, I was told to look it up on a databank.  If you have nothing but time on your hands maybe this is for you...but if you work for a living, you've been had by this company Encoreusa
I came across Magix Audio Cleaning Lab about 4 years ago.  Once I got the hang of it, I really liked it.  However, I kept wondering if there were better programs out there.  I mean, really, how good can it be for $39, right?  I recently paid $75 for Sony's famed Sound Forge Studio (which is the Sound Forge program minus various some features).  I spent a lot of time with Sound Forge Studio, working to perfect my transfer of some private music recordings from cassette to CD.  I was happy with what I was able to accomplish with Sound Forge.  At least I thought I was happy.  I compared my work in Sound Forge Studio to the same cassette transfer I did with Magix Audio Cleaning Lab 10 (the previous iteration of this software).  Guess what?  I liked the Magix work much better.  So, I immediately purchased Audio Cleaning Lab 11 and unintalled Sony's Sound Forge Studeio from my computer.  Magix could charge $150 for this software and I would buy it in a second.  Your going to have to take the time to carefully read through the full manual to get the most out of this software - but it is worth the effort.   ---  --- This program does the work of software costing 3 times as much. 
I'm very disappointed with the results. I am fairly young, 31. I have very fine lines and i thought this would make them disappear. It really didn't do anything to my skin. Plus it is greasy and has an unpleasant smell. I do not recommend this
I loved the game.The characers are great. The worlds are interesting, it still deosnt look outdated. And the combat is fairly strategic. Unfortuneatley the games ending is rather lack luster
unable to view because of incompatible format (as you warned me!)However, my ancestor James McLintock of Barnsley, Yorkshire, England sent John Wayne an eiderdown quilt for making the film (which is why I wanted the DVD)so.....
This is great! The free trial version on download.com had saved my computer (the only program that got rid off some spyware that was in my start-up and causing lots of problems). And I've also used the trial version on several of my friends' computers. It hasn't picked up much, though, since I bought it. But that's probably because now I have a new hard drive and a firewall. Before, I  bought the computer used and didn't know what a firewall was. I should have saved the disk and installed it when I started having problems. But oh well, it's doing it's job and if I start having problems once the CD expires, then I will probably buy a new disk. That's how good it is
I don't own this clock, but I do own one of it's sister clocks, the Tambour Style Mantel Clock, and it did not change for DST now that the date has changed.  Even though I've owned my clock for all of a month and a half, River City Cuckoo Clocks does not consider this fact to be a defect.  Since I would assume that all their radio controlled clocks have the same electronics, I would be very wary about buying this clock
I hope the person reviewing above is joking because it is not a body hair removal wax, it is for automobiles. The high percentage of white carnuba which is what it is made with provides an intense luster to the car paint
My boyfriend always got ingrown hair on his neck, and he was very skeptical about using this. Now he  doesn't get any ingrown hairs and he doesn't pick at them anymore.  He will not live without it now, and we both recommend it!
It vibrates like a massage mode of Sonic Complete. You'll get less than what you pay. You should brush hard even while it is vibrating
I recently tried to update my Norton Systemworks.  Halfway through the update, I got a message telling me it was unable to uninstall my old Norton Systemworks.  I tried to back out of the installation at that point, but was unable.  I called the Norton company, spent an hour on the phone with a tech, only to have them tell me it was my computer.  I assured them that I was just using my computer, which was fine, and now it doesn't work.  They told me there was nothing further that they could do, and that I would have to call a computer service company.  I found out that the uninstall process corrupted my operating system, causing me to lose everything on my hard drive, and requiring a new operating system.  I have run into other people who had exactly the same problem, with no help from the Norton Company.  I will never again buy a Norton product.  I only wish I could get my money back from them.
I read Bill Bryson's "A Walk in the Woods" and laughed hysterically at many parts of the book, and through the rest was either duly entertained or pleasantly educated (for the "educated" aspect, Bill interlaces the book with fascinating factual tangents). ---  --- I started into "In a Sunburned Country" with similar expectations, and especially since I have always longed and planned to visit Australia.  To state that I was disappointed is a severe understatement.  After reading this book I now have little to no desire to visit the "land down under;" my only hope is that I will completely forget what I read in Bryson's book so that I may one day look forward to and enjoy visiting Australia.  (Senility be merciful and consume me hastily!) ---  --- My best estimate is that Bryson was commissioned to write a ~350 page book about Australia.  During and / or after his trip, his creative sense must have taken a vacation of its own.  I have rarely struggled so much to get through a book as I did with this one.  Bryson even stooped so low as to use an urban legend as a "story" relayed second-hand from one of the Australians he "met."  Such a stunt makes me question if any of his accounts are real in any of his books. ---  --- The only saving grace to this book was the educational tangents.  These, at least, provided for some interesting reading. ---  --- After comparing notes with another person who ventured to read another of Bryson's books ("I'm A Stranger Here Myself") after she read "A Walk in the Woods," it would appear that "In a Sunburned Country" is not the only snore-fest that Bryson has churned out.  Perhaps he isn't a "one hit wonder," but I for one am not going to waste my time or money finding out. ---  --- So, if you are looking for the same caliber of writing that Bryson provided in "A Walk in the Woods," look to another author or prepare to be greatly disappointed. 
I purchased this for myself and my 7 year old to play with. The screen is way too dark to be able to use at dusk or after, but if in direct sunlight, you can't see it either. --- It's pretty small (buttons and screen) and a little confusing. If you are a person who is using hard earned money to purchase this, then don't. But if you just want to check it out and be okay with not wanting it later or losing the money you spent, go for it
This product just doesn't cut my nose hair as close as the Panasonic it replaced. If I could remember the model of the Panasonic, I would mention it in this review. I hope I can find the manual for the Panasonic so I can get another one. ---  --- Beware that many of the new designs are going this rout (even Panasonic). The manufacturers are saying this allows for more natural filtration, but I think its more of a liability issue on their part (someone probably got sued for a nicked nose). I just won't buy their products anymore if they're going to design them for marginal performance
Poor quality product. --- The product is two rigid pieces of plastic. --- A slight warpage of back piece of my plastic case made  --- it impossible to fit my chocolate phone.   --- You won't know if your case will fit until you try to put it on!!! --- You're taking a chance if you buy this produc
The non-functioning illuminating speckles on Illuminite products quickly disappear despite following care instructions. If you pay less for their clothing than regular clothing, go for it. If you're paying more, you're wasting your money
At first this case seemed like a good idea, but after the 3rd use, the zipper broke. Since the case does not stay open on its own, there is  tendency to push the case open and force the zipper backward and apart. After fixing it a couple of times, it is now permanently broken. Bad design. Maybe Velcro would have been better
I love this straightener!  I have had two other straighteners including one from a salon that cost over $80 and this one works much better then either of the other two.  All my friends also love it and are always asking to barrow it
After buying several different seat cushions for my office chair I found this seat and it is the best choice I ever made. The seat has a low profile but is extremely comfortable
I bought this for my father who only has one leg to use in his shower/tub combo.  He loves it.  Esp. the height adjustment feature
I almost fell for it...then I realized, how in the world are those pearls so cheap??  They aren't real!  If you are a sucker for a good deal like me think about it before you buy it.  It would be helpful if the item was advertised as "imitation pearl thong."
I bought this out of a cut rack for $3.99. It sat in my CD tower for at least 5 years before I ever really listened to it.I couldn't stand the way it sounded over my stereo and I came close to trading it.I brought it to work and put my headphones on and it sounds like a completely different album.I really like the whole experience. I'm lucky I brought it up here-it was going nowhere at home but I'm playing it a couple of times a day over my headphones. I don't know anything about this band,I bought it on a whim,but I'd reccommend this album and I may follow up on this band
This DVD gives a very good 60 minute workout. As others have pointed out the cardio is very dancy. The first time I did it, I felt a bit awkward with the steps, but when I did it the second time I was able to follow along with no problems. The dance moves are a fun change up from my usual routine. If someone like Denise Austin were leading this one, I don't think I would play along. Minna is by far my favorite instructor, so I go along with it and it ends up being a fun workout. I wouldn't want to do this every day, but it is good to have something different in the rotation. ---  --- I think the toning section is excellent. I am not looking to bulk up. I just want my body to firm up and look better when I wear shorts and a tank top. I like how she combines upper and lower body exercises. It's easy to follow and you feel like you hit every muscle area in 30 minutes. I use 3 pound weights at this point and I can see where in the future I might be buying 4 pound weights.  ---  --- Minna is a great instructor. She has excellent cueing and is very encouraging. She is never annoying. I also have her Optimizer- Balanced Blend DVD and I love that one.
This headset has a major flaw - the connections between the headset and phone are full of static.  The other parties don't hear it, but their voice is  constantly zapped by the static, and I'm asking them to repeat themselves. I've compared it with a couple other headsets I've got, and they don't have this problem in the same locations.  Actually, this headset has static problems ANYWHERE - office, car, out walking, you name it. ---  --- Do yourself a favor and avoid this one
My twin sons got this for christmas when they were 3.  They loved it!!!  The dog is so cuddly and cute.  They loved playing pretend with the accessories.  My only complaint is that within a day the latch was falling off, the syringe was coming apart, and the brush had lost a couple of bristles.  The boys had not played rough with it, it just wasn't the quality that I had hoped for.  It is a real favorite of theirs, I am just afraid that it won't last as long as their imaginations.  I think that with a few improvements it will be a fantastic toy.  A real winner for young children in the hospital. 
emotionally shattering true-life tale (well, sorta) based on an incident in director louis malles youth wherein the school in which he (played by the very beautiful gaspard vanesse who sadly did not continue acting) was enrolled served as a haven for jewish students hiding out from the nazis. what could have been merely a suspense tale or a coming of age movie (and it IS both, and splendid examples of each) instead resonates as a meditation on survival, betrayal, and accomodating and forgiving oneself. a great film, but only for mature audiences.
This works great for charging both my DS Lite and classic DS from USB. I also like the included keychain flashlight- it's kind of random thing to include that is in no way related to the charger, but it's quite bright and handy to have anyways. ---  --- I'm not sure why the previous reviewer says that it doesn't fit the DS Lite- it does, perfectly. Perhaps she is trying to use the GBA Micro adapter that is included? You don't need to- the adapter is only to charge classic DS/GBA or GBA Micro- the cable itself is all you need to charge DS Lite
I bought this, mostly because of how obsessed I am with Pink Sugar.  This product smells sweet.  It smells like you rubbed yourself with a box of truffles before you left the house.  I personally think of this as a good thing- I love candy/food scents.  My perfume collection is such that I am suprised I'm not followed everywhere I go by a swarm of bees.   ---  --- If you're looking for a sophisticated scent, please don't buy this, or Pink Sugar.  If you are looking to have people ask, "Hey, do you smell a delicious cake?" everytime you walk past...buy away.  And who doesn't want to smell like a delicious cake? 
it gets laughs in its comicness in certain scenes --- it gets shocks --- like the beginning war scenes and the fight scenes --- it gets more interesting as the plot unravels --- great actors picked for such roles --- the perfect killing machines --- one insane in the brain --- and one out to save lives that shouldn't be lost in the first place --- the diner scene where the soldier orders alot of food and keeps eating and the guy says how you gonna pay for this and the soldier says "I just want to eat, I don't wanna hurt you, then he kicks ass while still enjoying his meal. and his reporter female friend comes in and says "good meal" as a question that is. and he says without words "makes a happy sigh" that's hilarious. and how she looks around and see everyone who got their ass kicked from keeping him from eating his food --- priceless movie --- worth the watch again and again --- I'm glad I saw this on tv when I was younger --- and I'm glad I got this on dv
Excellent. One of the few food items I've found on here that I think I'll buy again. Remember that it's best chilled/ice cold, if you're ever gonna sample it. Not so good when not so cold, great when actually cold. Very refreshing feel either way, though, after you've had a drink
     I use almonds in cereal, cake and bread, both for nutrition and taste. For years, I've been grinding my own. This is a high quality product that saves time since it's already ground. The price is highly competitive
The Ab Roller was a big disappointment for me. It was more difficult to assemble because of shoddily constructed parts. Then , once that project was done, I was unable to use it as the design is clearly for someone at least 4 or 5 inches taller than me. As a very petite(4'11")woman  my hands barely reached the top bar, making it impossible for me to get the leverage to use the machine properly. So beware shorties out there
Siempre compro ERNIE BALL porque son las mas duraderas y las de mayor calidad que he usado. ---  --- He probado otro par de marcas pero nada en comparacion con ERNIE BALL!!! ---  --- El desgaste de las cuerdas es practicamente nulo; yo practico 15 horas como minimo a la semana, tengo una Jackson K3PRO (Floy R.) y aguantan bastantes libras. ---  --- Puedes prolongar el uso de las mismas si empleas mantenimiento con limpiadores de cuerdas, ya que lo unico que he visto que con el tiempo (mas de 6 meses)se oxidan un poco
Lot's of skiing, women that were hot in the nineties, and a little bit of cheese combine to make this the best drama of all time for skiiers.  This movie teaches essential survival skills like exactly how to handle a French jackass ski-instructor if he ever blames you for stealing his heli-ski clients.  What you do is offer to split the tip with them, then when he says with his french accent, "I don wan to split de tip", just slam your ski locker in his face and come up with an extremly witty comment, then call him an azzhole as you walk away.....brilliant!!   --- Also, what do you do when you've been invited up to the mansion of a European lady with enormous teeth and you search the whole house for her, only to find her her in the indoor swimming pool wearing nothing but the fur under her arms?  When she asks if you swim you answer, "like a fish" and whatever you do don't take your clothes off.  This would take too much time.  Just kick off your high-tops that aren't laced at the top and dive in.  When you come to the surface of the water, the hair flip to get water out of your face must be perfect or she may not invite you to stay the night.  PERFECT!!   --- I look at Aspen Extreme more as an instructional video for these situations.  Thanks TJ & Dex, because of you I now live in my van and life is sweet.   --- I'm kidding about all of this but it still is my favorite ski flick for sure. 
Have always used the regular California Duster.  Time to replace the one I have had for years.  Thought I would try the Extra Large duster.  This has twice the dusting surface, it is faster and does the same great job.  I have a black Town and Country which shows dust!  This does a great job in just a few minutes.  A great product
This knife's single blade, a bottle opener, nail file, and two flat-head screwdrivers (one large, one small) come packed in a slimline aluminum case. There's a can opener, too--though I've never tried to use it--and a panel on one side that can be engraved. It's an elegant package and lightweight. Once you're used to this little buddy, you won't want to carry the standard red plastic version. ---  --- The only caveat: Don't take this to the airport. It will be confiscated.  ---  --- NOTE: To avoid losing it, you can attach a cord or thin chain to the small ring at the end. With this, a woman can attach her knife to her purse, and will be automatically reminded to return it when the task is done. A man can attach the chain to a belt loop. Until I did this, I had several "walk" after lending them to someone who needed a knife "just for a minute."
We cannot get the refill bags into our Diaper Dekor Plus. Are there different size bags depending on whether you got the regular or plus unit? The lady in the store said NO so we bought 3 boxes of extra refills. Now we cant use any of them. What should we do
There isnt much i can say about this item just that the picuture doesnt do the item justice and the seller was great to deal with easy transaction and no problems
I had read--with delight--the book called "Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH" to my grandsons, so I thought the movie would be a nice followup. ---  --- Wrong! It barely resembles the book, and all the most important parts are glossed over or left out. It might be OK for a child who hasn't read the book, but we were disappointed
I brought this gift for my son and his wife; their daughter was born on 2/21/07.  when I questioned them as to why they had not used the bottle warmer, they just didn't get around to using it. I insisted they read the directions and start using it. the next day, my son stated. wow mom this is the best baby shower gift.  they could not believe how fast the bottle warmer worked. how much timed it saved them as new parents, and the milk was heated at just the right temperature each time.  my son was so thankful, that I insisted he use the product
My wife bought these for me and I was just putting them on my morning Cheerios like a madman and I said, "Hey, these are good...where did you get 'em?"  ---  --- "Oh, from Amazon...can you believe they were only $17.00?" ---  --- Silence. ---  --- I just looked at her, "Are you nuckin' futs? Gimme those things. I'm going to put them into our safety deposit box with our bonds, our living trusts, and my favorite Hot Wheels..." ---  --- Blueberries are good for you and I would suggest to eat them on a regular basis, but the price for these things is simply absurd. Do I look like I'm wearing my shirt that says, "STUPID"? I don't think so. I'm sure you can get frozen blueberries for less and hey, fresh is always good, and if you can't get frozen or fresh, get a Hostess Blueberry Pie. Sure it's sugary and will feel like you've got a leadweight in your stomach after eating it but the pie is only .50 cents..these little blue suckers are $17.00. That's more than my whole wedding cost. ---  --- Just kidding. I'm not that cheap. Actually, I'm not cheap at all, but I do like money and I refuse to pay $17 for some humiliated looking berries... ---  ---  --- Geesh
within two weeks the hose connection was leaking.  the manufacturer never responded when i contacted the
It's interesting when you find out that tapioca pearls are actually those little bubbly round things you find in pudding.  They are REALLY good.  This is a great product.  I recommend it
Gloves are toasty...perform as expected, and are a sweet luxury after a long, cold day on the slopes; HOWEVER, the D-SIZED batteries (1 per glove) are considerably more bulky than what I expected.  Most reasonable people would anticipate having to use 3 or 4 AA batteries...but no, just one, bit fat chicken-roastin' D-sized battery.  Good product, but consider whether wearing the big ol' D's around your wrist all day will get on your nerves, or whether you'll barely notice, being bundled-up and bulkified anyway.  May also interfere with cinching up your jacket sleeves when it's really nippy out.
This title is the tre sequel to Railroad Tycoon. If you loved the old 1990's original, you'll enjoy this one as well. Only con to the game is replayablity, which is very limited
Rewind to 1992. It's the dawn of the so-called Information & Knowledge Age. Back then, I wrote a book on the need to liberate and effectively channel the creativity of all employees in an organization. The rationale: To create higher performing organizations in a time of intense global competition. With pressing needs for superior innovation. And improved productivity. Amid ever-leaner budgets. (Sound familiar?) ---  --- Flash forward a dozen years to today and IDEAS ARE FREE (a title echoing Phil Crosby's classic QUALITY IS FREE).  ---  --- This new book makes clear today that my impassioned plea from a decade ago failed to eradicate idea-stifling organizational cultures. Way too many work places, it seems, still quell expressions of innovative thinking by both frontline employees and middle managers.  ---  --- So the case for turning on the innovation spigot needs to be made again with renewed vigor. In answering that call, Professors Robinson & Schroeder offer some worthwhile and occasionally surprising and compelling contributions to this topic that is as relevant now as ever. ---  --- IDEAS ARE FREE presents an articulate case that organizations -- and individual managers -- need to unleash the *still* largely untapped brainpower intentionally and quite unfortunately held-back by employees.  ---  --- Three elements make IDEAS ARE FREE especially worthy of your time and money. ---  --- 1. The authors aim their advice at regular workaday managers. Sure, they rightfully point out how organizational systems are often "dysfunctional." And they make the case that many corporate practices actually *discourage* creative contributions by individuals even as they try to *incent* those very behaviors. But Robinson & Schroeder don't aim their prescriptions at policy-making top executives only. Many chapters conclude with what the authors term "guerilla tactics" -- clear directives for simple actions that even frontline supervisors can put to work "without the boss's permission."  ---  --- 2. The book dramatically makes the case that paying for ideas -- as part of an organization's formal suggestion systems -- is fraught with potential negative side-effects. My own corporate experience as an executive championing a newly installed suggestion system bears out the startling reality that this well-intentioned process can turn into a self-destructive minefield. (And, let the record show, I largely missed this dimension in covering suggestion systems back in my '92 work.) ---  --- 3. Many interesting, well-developed (albeit occasionally dated) anecdotes illustrate the book's sound principles. They help make IDEAS ARE FREE a grounded, engaging, and palatable read. ---  --- Back in '92, I suggested in my book MAVERICKS! that, "Managers should be asking questions like: What is the value of a useful new idea? If one good idea leads to another, where could thousands and thousands lead us? What is the cost to the organization for not tapping the endlessly renewable resource of ideas in our employees' heads?"  ---  --- Getting to the root of the problem, I asked: "Isn't the job of a manager to *recognize and choose* from lots of great ideas generated by fellow work associates?" And answered: "Unfortunately, most managers -- even those who claim they invite suggestions from their people -- subscribe to the time-honored myth that a manager's job is to *have* the ideas." ---  --- In 2004, Robinson & Schroeder again plow many of these very same themes (and cite data that also have been around for a long time). Still, this book explores afresh the opportunities that arise from drawing out the best thinking of every employee. And it presents realistic tactics that all managers can deploy to effectively deal with these still-critical issues. ---  --- Wherever you sit in the hierarchy, read IDEAS ARE FREE to seize powerful ideas about potential gains for your organization's progress and prosperity. ---  --- Don Blohowiak --- Lead Well Institut
We used the machine once, and were disappointed by the performance.  The second time that we attempted to use it, it wouldn't heat.  After contacting Roseart, I was told that I could ship it to them at my expense for a replacement.  I will probably not bother, as it was a lousy product to begin with. 
The beads and charms are nice enough, but for the price you get very little with this kit -- only about 50 tiny glass beads and 50 spacers, plus the charms. There's nothing here special enough to justify spending the money -- there are plenty of nicer jewelry kits out there that are more generous with the supplies
This CD has some good songs on it, but the majority of them are less than 2 minutes! It's kind of a rip off since the songs are much shorter than I expected. They are mixed together, and sometimes a song is so short that the one before it is still fading out by the time the song after it has started! If you don't mind really short songs, buy this, but I wouldn't recommend it otherwise
First off. The knife is great. I wouldn't expect anything less from swiss army. only bad part about the knife is that the altimeter has an accuracy error margin of about 75%. And since this is both the title of the knife and the main feature of it, I give the knife a two. Only because you can get a knife just like it without the altimeter that works just as well. 
I have found Gerber brand clothing to be disappointing. The don't stand up to laundering very well, in that they shrink quite a bit. They already seem small for the size on the label, but it gets worse after you wash and dry them (even on the "delicate" cycle). My 6-week old was already wearing onesies and sleepers sized 3-6 months! It's worth spending the extra money for a better brand, such as Carter's
I have three types of headlamps and I like this one the most. ---  --- Here is why: 1) it's cheap, 2) it runs a long time on three AAA batteries, and 3) the red light is awesome.  ---  --- You can use the red light and still keep your "night vision". I use it to read in bed becasue it is not as visible or distracting to others as a white light. ---  --- My only problem with it is that the knobs are a little confusing, even after two years of use. I often have to twist twice to get the right setting. And I'm usually good at that stuff
This piece took forever to assemble, arriving in no fewer than 30 pieces. The directions are vague... everything in the diagrams is a rectangle! But the actual parts aren't labeled, so you never know which of the 7 types of rectangular parts they mean. When finished, all of the front slats between the drawers fell out anytime we moved it... they have no bolts to hold them in, the just sit in shallow slots. The drawers are shaky and the whole unit is unstable. Also, as many of the holes are not lined up, so I couldn't even put in some of the bolts.
This book is a small bundle of common knowledge wrapped up in an insulting amount of hyperbole and hucksterism (and very bad English).  Just how many times can you claim a technique will improve your workouts "by a factor of ten" or is the most valuable breakthrough "in history" before you lose all credibility? ---  --- In the first 30 pages, winnowing out the fluff, I read this: ---  --- 1) Fad diets, bulimia, and steroids are bad for you. ---  --- 2) Gaining muscle and losing fat are biologically distinct processes, so they require two classes of exercises. ---  --- 3) It's good to concentrate your attention on the particular muscles you are using during weight-training routine. ---  --- 4) Creative visualization and self-hypnosis can help you reach your goals.  (OK, I'm a bit skeptical about this one.) ---  --- In other words, this book has taught me nothing of value that I didn't already know.  Looking ahead in the index, I can see much more of the same.  I'm afraid I've been had. ---  --- I bought this book on the strength of Amazon reader recommendations.  Please don't make the same mistake.  Look, to gain muscle, lift weights every other day and eat lots of protein; to lose fat, do cardio on off days and watch your total calories.  If you're already doing those things, don't bother with this book.  I was looking for more specific tips, but I didn't find them here, and neither will you
Less technicolor and more monochromatic than its predecessor, "In Like Flint" still uses broad strokes to great advantage in poking fun at the Bond films.  The indomitable Derek Flint returns to save the world, this time from a bevy of beauties who simultaneously raise the ire of the world's women while replacing powerful males with surgically-altered substitutes (leading to, perhaps, the most prescient line of dialogue in any 1960s film--upon discovering that the man in the White House is not who he seems to be, a disbelieving Flint says, "An actor as president?").  That is, until a renegade ZOWIE general (Steve Inhat) decides it's his turn to take the reins of power.  The delightful Lee J. Cobb is back as Flint's curmudgeonly boss, Cramden, as are the secret agent's posse of female admirers, and TV's Batgirl, Yvonne Craig, even shows up as a Russian ballerina.  "In Like Flint" feels more grown up than the previous film, partly because the lighting and cinematography are more stark and partly because the humor is sometimes more rooted in satire than parody.  Notions like the Red Scare being a feint to the very real dangers of corruption from within and the beauty industry actually having our worst interests in mind--and charging a premium for them--are slipped in with more obvious gags involving oversized eyebrows, cross-dressing, and the bouncing sing-a-long ball.  Only the crankiest among us are likely to find the juvenile sexism of either Flint film worth comment, as it's a staple of the genre, meaning that the biggest weakness here is the same as the earlier effort:  a no-frills DVD.  
My son in law insists that I give him a subscription to this magazine every year for his birthday. He really looks forward to it.
Did not care for this one really, it is better as a body wash
Works well, light weight. I wish it came with a light bulb changer like some of the other similar system
Reviewgium - Volume I, issue XVII ---  --- Over sixty and still going strong, Neil Young has released a new album, largely politcal and essentially a focused attack on U.S. President George W. Bush. As opposed to his last album which was a more bittersweet, country-tinged effort, Living With War is a pretty much straightforward rock album, mostly electric with a background choir featured on many tracks, as well as an unusually predominant trumpet player on several tracks. Musically, it's nothing spectacular, in fact every song more or less follows the same tired formula, and there are really no diversions from the grunge-like rhythm guitar chords. But the album is obviously intended to have a major focus on the vocals and lyrics. Of course, many people do not like Neil Young's vocals, but there are many well-developed choral passages throughout the album, including a soulful, a capella arrangement of "America the Beautiful," which closes the album. So basically, I feel the vocal performances compensate--though not totally--for the lack of musical diversity. Lyrically, the album is pretty blatant; it could almost be a 60's protest album. But underlying that, is a ray of hope and an urge to change our country for the better. ---  --- There are a few decent tracks on the album, even if they are not exactly mind-blowing (not that Neil Young was ever a showboater). "After the Garden" is actually quite a good song as is "Shock and Awe." "Flags of Freedom" is a bit of an upper, so I can probably call that the album highlight, though I'm sure the more politically-minded citizen will enjoy "Let's Impeach the President," an almost humorous overview of Bush's faltering standpoints. The final three songs divert from the general theme of dismay and protest, and offer feelings of hope and introspection. ---  --- If you are not a fan of Neil Young, you'll find nothing here that will convert you, so you may just want to leave this on the shelf. If you are "anti-Bush" you might get a buzz off of the lyrical aspect, but that's probably the only thrill you will get. I tend to avoid anything political, so music aside, this album's message does not really appeal to me. It's like, yeah, people hate the President, blah blah blah, we know...give it a rest. For fans of Neil, I wouldn't exactly say "you're not missing anything" by avoiding this album; there is some good stuff on there, but you might want to wait until you see it cheap in the "used" bin at your local CD shop. And for those interested, this is not a Crazy Horse album.
First, let me say that I love fountain pens--all types, but especially Sheaffers.  A colleague of mine turned me on to Lamy pens and they've become my workhorses. ---  --- I teach English so I grade many, many papers and I refuse to write with a boring pen.  I used to use my antique shaeffers until a student almost dropped one.  I had to have a daily pen that was, well, near disposable.  I remembered the Lamy and ordered a Safari.   Now, if something happens to it, I don't have a stroke.  Plus, the broad nib has a wonderful ink flow! ---  --- I give them as gifts.  They are a good pen to start using as they are very forgiving. ---  --- Do they write as well as my older pens?  Nope.  Are they more user-friendly?  Yup.  (Think mid 60's Jaguar E-Type versus 2005 Honda Civic.  Which is more fun to drive?  Which would you drive to the grocery store?  Get my point?) ---  --- Bottom line:  It is a $25 pen that you'll use more than your $100+ antique pens. 
Big for the size advertised, not fitting as snugly for pear shaped gals. Hoped it would shrink, since I'm a perfect 6, and it didn't. Disappointed
First of all let me clearly state that im from Atlanta and I am a diehard fan of Lil Scrappy and that is why it breaks my heart to tell you that this CD is garbage. Besides Money in the Bank there are no other standout cuts and it is a shame because the underground mixtape he dropped with DJ Don Cannon early last year was on fire, He and Cannon delivered all new tracks and there were all on point, that was of course before 50's influence which brings us to our problem. The influence of Curtis Jackson A.K.A 50 Cent is very clear on this album. I like 50 but he knows little of the way we make records down south. If the G-Unit boss would have just stayed out he way and let Scrappy pick and choose his own tracks, verses etc. everything may have been fine. The guy is a control freak and as a result nobody in the "A" is pumping this and it is a shame because when Scrappy is on point the boy is unstoppable. This CD is garbage plain and simple and 50's influence is going to put the the crown prince of the south's career in serious jerpody unless he quickly wise's up. This is an honest review from a fan that has been down since day one.I have bought all the mixtapes and everything else he's dropped but, im telling you If you the consumer buy this Cd you will regret it and to Scrappy ditch the G Unit do what's in your heart and get back to business.
If you could condense heaven into a colorful, 3" diameter sphere, it would be a peach.  They are candies that grow on trees, are picked by angel-elves, and teleported directly to your local grocery store to avoid blemishes.  One day I was eating a peach while walking downhill and caused a peach-juice-slide.  Everybody on the sidewalk jumped on the slide and it carried them down to a radiant peach-pool at the bottom, which everyone splashed into with a wave of orgasmic bliss. --- Said best by the Presidents of the United States of America,  "Nature's candy in my hand, can or pie.
The Big Bubbler is the greatest bubble wand----we have had consistently huge bubbles with the top-of-the-line/expensive bubble solution, as well as, the cheapest $1.99 jugs.  The only thing that didn't work at all for us was straight dish detergent (hey, we were desperate).  My youngest toddler will chase the bubbles endlessly, and even a neighbor's preteen son couldn't resist chasing the large bubbles across our yard.  I also like that I am playing WITH the kids when I make the bubbles for them vs. simply turning on a battery-operated machine and then standing back.  ---  --- If I had to gripe, it would only be to say that I wish the top of the wand (the end that holds the bubble solution) could be stood on end.  It is hard for the little ones to keep the top from spilling while waving the wand; it is also tough for them to get the wand back into the top to get more bubble solution. ---  --- We also go through a LOT of solution---I plan to buy a few large jugs of it to have it on hand.  But, this seems like a minor inconvenience given how much fun we have all had watching the bubbles dance all over our yard
Blinx can be very time consuming for us older xBox players (whom didn't grow up with a controller in our hands).  I found Blinx to be fun, entertaining and challenging.   Even though it is rated for younger children, I think the strategy involved is for older children, teenagers and some of us adults.   For anyone wishing to have some fun, have to think a bit, Blinx is for you
I tested this along with the Neuros MPEG4 and must say hands down the winner in picture quality is the Neuros.  The picture with the SanDisk is very pixelated, especially with fast action sports like football and basketball.   ---  --- The SanDisk does have a better interface, and is easier to understand and set up quickly, but in the end the picture and sound quality are poor. ---  --- FYI - I'm using a PSP as my viewer
Not a bad product, but has very little bass response and the weather channel does not come in very well, no matter where the antenna is positione
I had bought these for my boy thinking they had a fly front much like the mens versions I wear. They are my son's least favorite underwear mearly cause he has to pull the front of them down in order to use the bath room. He's only 6 and when I had trained him I tought him to use the fly on the front of his underwear. In my personal thoughts are that men's/boy's underwear has a fly in the front for need use, unlike that for women and girls whom don't require it
I just upgraded my Webster software to this version for WinXP.  It's ok and does the job it's intended to perform. But I liked the previous versions that displayed both the definitions and the thesaurus in parallel panels. Just a matter of display preference, so it's not that important to every user.
If you havn't tried Lady Grey, try it and then buy the loose leaf at this price.  You won't regret it.  This is one of the best everyday teas I've found, with a healthy dash of citrus and a flowery finish with no cloying flavors, it really is a good all around tea for any time of the day.  Buying it on Amazon saves a lot of time trying to find it in stock and it arrived faster than the books I ordered at the same time
I found this title messing around adding things to my wish list.  I only read the blurb on Amazon enough to see Haitian Creaole listed as one of the languages.  Today updating my wish list I took extra time to find out why this was rated so low since nearly every thing on my list is 4 stars or more!  How unfortunate to find out that others before me made the mistake I almost made buying this in hopes of it having Haitian Creole!  Very disappointing!!!!  The makers should be ashamed
Carter Burwell's soundtrack music to "Rob Roy" was an early sign that he was not just getting it right. The score is all wrong but so is the movie. This movie needed an uplifting score. Carter Burwell could not deliver it
These headphones have a dececent sound but genuinely no noice cancelling effect.  The battery powers the speakers a bit which does make them a littel louder, but nothing special.  As you see, the price is down to $22.00 which is probably a good price for these (unfortunatly, I bought them at $50.00 and had to return them
This clip is great and it doesn't just work on UTG guns it works on smith and wesson shot guns. Any one with a shot gun from UTG or smith and wesson should buy this ---  --- Ps. I'm 1
I bought this mount for a philips 42" plasma TV.  The TV weighs probably about 100LBs. ---  ---   I thought the price for it was OK, but i don't know how much an average mount would cost and think the price i paid was pretty good compared to some other mounts.   ---  ---   The mount was put on our living room wall by a "handy man" because i didn't have a stud finder.  He was able to to put the mount on the wall very easily and the assembly was pretty basic.  The mount sits very well secured and the frame of the mount is very durable and strong which leaves me with a good sense that my investment is properly secured. ---  ---   The 5o tilt function is very nice to have and is being used so the TV sits a little high, but is aimed perfectly and adds a nice presentation to the house.  The room for the input cables is a little small, and causes some cables to be bend a little close to the connector than i would like to see but haven't noticed any degradation in the signal.  None of the cables so far look damaged and will remain that way, so its not of a concern.  I took the cables and made a 1" "trunk" of cables with the power cable and all and video inputs and it seamlessly hangs down the middle to a cabinet with all the accessories. ---  ---   The TV sits very close to the wall which was a key characteristic of the project even with the 5o tilt. ---  ---   I rate this item with 5 stars because it is very well made and very strong.  It also looks nice and stays well hidden.  Its features with the 5o tilt work great and the locking bar makes removing the TV easy(I had to take it off the wall to trunk the cables).  I am very very happy with it and would definitely recommend this product
These are the bulkiest, leakiest diapers i've ever used! Even though they don't have bleach, there is still tons of pesticide used in cotton production - plus, these aren't even made from recycled materials
I recently discovered Joyce Cooling. Yeah, I've been in the dark ages. She is one of the smoothest guitarists out there and she does not try to sound like everyone else. I especially appreciate her percussive use of intonations. She's got chops galore and is a beautiful woman to boot. You can hear it all in her music. Buy Revolving Door! You'll love it
Shopped a long time for this one.  Wanted more pit than the copper bowls had to offer.  Plus came with grill, cover and handy fire tool.  Nice deal, easy to assemble
If you are a fan of horror movies, the old EC comic books, Stephen King, or just fun movies in general, than look no further than this 1982 classic! ---  --- ================================================= --- THE MOVIE (5/5): --- "Creepshow" is an anthology of scary stories-- five of them-- that is bridged together by a sixth tale of a boy who loves horror comics and his abusive dad who hates them. The movie features pitch-perfect performances by an all-star 80's cast that seems to be having a lot of fun being in this scream of a movie. The stories are as follow: ---  --- 1. "FATHER'S DAY" (4.5/5) --- Stars Carrie Nye, Ed Harris, and Viveca Lindfors. --- Easily the cheesiest of the five stories (but still a lot of fun), Father's Day tells the tale of a family reunion from hell when a long-dead dad rises from the grave for his "caaaaaaakkeeeee" (and for a little good old fashioned zombie revenge). ---  --- 2. "THE LONESOME DEATH OF JORDY VERRILL" (4/5) --- Stars Stephen King. --- Although its easily the weakest of the stories, it's probably also the most original, so keep your finger off the fast-forward button. Stephen King (!) gives a nutty and throughly enjoyable performance as a country bumpkin who battles alien plantlife from a meteroite that touches down in his backyard. Sounds weird? You don't know the half of it. ---  --- 3. "SOMETHING TO TIDE YOU OVER" (5/5) --- Stars Leslie Nielsen, Ted Danson, and Gaylen Ross. --- This segment is legendary. Leslie Nielsen gives the performance of his life as a psychotically jealous husband who takes a notion to bury his wife and her lover neck-deep in sand before the tide rolls in. Needless to say, love is more powerful than death, as our antihero soon finds himself neck deep in terrifying troubles of his own. ---  --- 4. "THE CRATE" (5/5) --- Stars Hal Holbrook, Adrienne Barbeau, and Fritz Weaver. --- Hands down the best tale of terror, it's no wonder that the three main actors of this single story also receive top billing in the picture's opening credits. This epic blood-soaked tale of insanity, fear, and fidelity is a timeless classic with excellent performances all around, and an unforgettable monkey-like demon from special effects master Tom Savini. The longest segment of the film, "The Crate" tells the story of Henry (Holbrook), a college professor with an unbelievably obnoxious and domineering wife (a brilliant performance by Barbeau). When Henry's colleague Dexter Stanley (Weaver) discovers a flesh-eating monster under the stairway under the stairs of the college and informs Henry, the henpecked husband makes plans to use the monster to his own domestic advantage. This out-of-this-world premise carries very real themes of love and death, friends and family, and moral responsibility versus personal hapiness. With subtle undertones that just hint at the depth of this brilliantly written horror masterpiece, Stephen King has never been more entertaining than with this perfectly crafted tale. ---  --- 5. "THEY'RE CREEPING UP ON YOU" (4.5/5) --- Stars E.G. Marshall. --- Bringing us back down for a soft landing, Romero and King conclude their horror anthology with this wonderfully bizarre tale of a millionaire hypochondriac whose allegedly germ-proof apartment is overwhelmed with an army of cockroaches. This one goes way over the top, but it all keeps with the tempo of the movie. If you know somebody who is deathly afraid of bugs, try showing them the final scene of this segment, then sit back and enjoy their screams of bewilderment. ---  --- All in all, I'd have to say Creepshow is one of the top three horror films ever made. Rent it or buy it today! ---  --- ================================================= --- THE DISC (1/5): --- Unfortunately, the "geniuses" over at Warner Bros. have insulted this fine film and its fans by offering up a very lame disc. The picture quality is only passable, the letterbox formatting is kind of funky, and there are absolutely no extras, save for a trailer, which I don't really count as a real feature. The only good thing I can possibly say about the disc is that it's got 41 chapters, but only 21 of those are accesible with the disc. ---  --- While we'll have to wait for "Creepshow" to get the same Special Edition treatment as its inferior sequel, this bare bones disc only goes to show the strength of the film in the fact that even with no bonuses at all, "Creepshow" is still one of the most rewatchable and indispensable horror movies on the market
I am obviously addicted to Philosophy, but it's a good addiction.  My skin looks great, better than it ever has in my life!  Whenever I feel like doing something for myself, I try a new Philosophy product, because it's sure to give me a lift.  This product is called a "microdelivery peel", but I view (and use) it more as a toner.  Philosophy's two-part microdelivery peel is awesome, and I would not attempt to replace it with these pads.  With the two part peel, you clean your face with Purity Made Simple cleanser, then massage in the abrasive crystals.  After a few minutes, you squeeze out a little of the liquid, which mixes with the crystals on your face and heats up, infusing your skin with vitamin C and other healthy goodies.  That is a real peel!  These little pads, on the other hand, are cool, refreshing, and subtle.  You can use them every day, and they won't make your skin red.  They freshen your skin, and you know they contain great things that will help your skin, because they are made by Philosophy
Elle used to be a great fashion magazine, but no longer. Ofcourse, there are too many adds (but then, that's what pays for the mag). I just wish that Elle and many other fashion mags would quit presenting all these articles (the hard hitting type) on serious subjects that do not belong in a fashion periodical. I buy Elle for "the fashion/beauty advice" NOT to read some pseudo intellectual writer's hard hitting political agenda. For hard hitting news items I read the Wall Street Journal, Atlantic Monthly, and watch Fox News. 
This boot looked so much better online. For this boot to be by Nine West it looked very cheap. I was very disappointed with this product that I returned it but I'm still waiting for my refund!!
At first I thought it difficult to justify the added expense for paper, but you do get good quality. One reviewer comments on stains; but after buying and using 5 or 6 different moleskines, I have to believe that was an exception that would have been replaced. --- I like the Reporter Style for writing quickly or with limited space, but I like the bookmark that is on the standard notebooks
I recieved this as a Christmas gift from my wife. I am very --- pleased with the overall performance . I am a muscian who  --- plays a variety of instruments including drums and have been --- for30 years. I write and record original music and find this --- to be an excellent aid to keep me in time while recording --- stringed instrument tracks.The effects and rythymn tracks --- included are also a plus. This is a good beginner item for --- that young drummer to learn the basics on, without having --- to shell out mega bucks for a big set of drums that the --- child may loose interest in. They are also all but silent --- when used with headphones, so everyone in the house will --- not have to hear them. One cautionary note-mine DID NOT --- include the ac adapter as advertised; amazon.com is --- attempting to remedy this. You can pick up a 12 volt ada- --- pter at any Radio Shack for about twelve bucks
The progressive metal world better wake up and take note of this outstanding band that hails from Poland. These guys are a breath of fresh air with the oversaturated and stagnant progressive metal market that has developed over the past few years. So what do we get for our money you ask, a band comprising of well-schooled musicians, incredible song writing skills and the ability to weave so many different moods and time-passages into each song. There are a few scatterings of influences that aren't a major detraction from the overall mood of the album, namely Dream Theater, Pink Floyd, Porcupine Tree, Genesis and Anathema. ---  --- The vocals are clean without a trace of an accent,however they get getting slightly gruff in places but this only compliments the smooth flow of the music.  The guitar work is outstanding and David Gilmour from Pink Floyd is a strong reference point here. The rhythm section is outstanding; especially the drumming and the keyboards give the album a fuller sound with out being too over powering. If you want to start 2007 on a good note then Riverside is a worthy investment for sure.  
It caresses the inside of my mouth like the sinuous tongue of my beloved
SURE THESE FLOPPY'S ARE INEXPENSIVE...THEY ARRIVED ON TIME...THANKS AMAZON!!!!!  BUT THE PHOTO DOESN'T GIVE IT ANY CREDIT...THESE DON'T COME WITH A PLASTIC CARRYING CASE LIKE THE PHOTO...JUST A CRAPPY CARDBOARD BOX! COME ON GUYS....WHERES THE PLASTIC CASE FOR THESE THINGS, NOW THEY WILL BE FLOPPING ALL OVER THE PLACE IN MY DESK DRAWERS ETC
If were a celebrity I would endorse it on TV. --- It sweeps my car, hood, windows, roof, trunk lid and headlights beautifully! ---  --- The scraper is fierce and lets ice on the window know whos boss! ME thats who, with my long reach, red handled, Blizzard model 3512 snowbrush and scraper.  Thanks Hoppy!  
The satin finish and the design are very attractive.  I had to pump each chamber about 100 times to get it primed but after that it worked great.  You might want to prime it with water instead of shampoo to get things going.  The directions, which I lost, said something about priming. ---  --- Installation was easy.  It includes both glue or 4 short adhesive strips.  I went with the adhesive strips and it seems secure.  I figured if I ever have to remove it, I could just pull it off and use Goof Off to remove the adhesive. ---  --- If you fill one of the chambers with body soap, I recommend Neutrogena Rainbath Refreshing Shower and Bath Gel, Original Formula and a natural sponge.  I bought a synthetic sponge that looks like a natural one at Wal-Mart and it's a little rough
When i first got it i was sooo excited! But when i opened it, it had no instructions. even the 10 things to do with it didnt explain how to work everything. sure it was fun at first but then i realized, "how am i supposed to do anyhting?" the semi worst part was the stuff stunk. i got really nauseous when i got a wift of it. now i can usually handle smells but this was the worst! I got dizzy and almost through up! I wish i could have soaked everything in like bleach or sumthin just to get rid of the stench! I had to clean it too! i kept pointing my nose in the other direction and walking away for fresh air! I would not personally reccomend this. i ahve not been able to REALLY use it!! I dont no if directions was supposed to come w/ it or what but i can tell you that i was NOT pleased!
Don't listen to the reviews that claim that this lens is not a good choice for cropped sensor cameras (IE the 20D, 30D, Rebels etc) the Canon L lens are the best and this particular lens is no exception. I have had the lens for less than 24 hours now and am in love with the sharpness and color already.  ---  --- Great lens, great color, so well built, super sharp, just watch out if this is your first L lens, you'll be hooked. ---  --- This is a lens you will have for many years, great investment
Just wonderful, wonderful!  Even if you haven't seen the movie buy the music...so lovely and refreshing...of course, there is no one like Van Morrison (always and forever a 5-star), he tops the all-time charts for me...Kevin Kline is so smooth with La Mer...and the rest of the music is soulful and enchanting...you just can't miss with this one
I used to use Tend Skin. It works ok, but there are better things out there now. Tend Skin is an outdated product...like the sytptic pencil. Tend Skin stings, smells like pure alcohol and there is lots of wasted product because it is easy to spill. I recently switched to MiN Solution2 like it much better than Tend Skin. MiN Solution2 has a roller application (no waste), organic spearmint (fresh smell) and doesn't burn like Tend Skin.
I can't put it any better than the others before me have.  I did a lot of research before purchasing this train and am so glad I decided to spend a little bit more money for a TON more quality.  This is truly an heirloom train set that will be around longer than I will be (and I'm only 35).   ---  --- The other reviewers are also correct in advising that you shop around before purchasing this train set.  The prices vary wildly. ---  --- Yes, it hurts a little to spend this kind of money on a train set when you know there are others out there.  However, the others are cheaper for a reason... they're junk.  You simply can't do better than this set
I purchased this lens for my Canon EOS 20D digital camera and so far I really like it.  It focuses fast and produces very sharp, clear images.  As with any longer lens you do have to be careful about camera shake; I've had a few images come out blurry but these are usually interior shots.  I really like the 28-200mm focal length range and find the lens to be very versatile for framing wide shots of buildings or landscapes to zoomed in shots for portraits or close detail shots.  The lens feels solid and appears to be well constructed, which is typical for Canon products.  For the price range, this is an excellent lens.  You can only do better by spending considerable more money on an IS lens
Very politically manipulative primer that only gives 5/8 of the story. I add 1/8 because the author does acknowlege some of the huge problems caused by unbridled global capitalism, but then quickly glosses them over basically saying that these effects are unfortunate, but that free global trade is best for everyone in the long run. There is a lot of interesting incidental information as various terms are explained, but too often this reference becomes a one-sided sermon for free trade. These are the same deceptions that Robert Reich started pushing under Clinton. Repubs kept the song going without missing a beat. Most of both Dem and Repub reps support neoliberal policies - the rich get richer in both parties. Feel free to read to learn about terms, just be aware that the author is leading you down a highly biased path
I purchased this for my 2001 VW golf, and it did not work. I know some of the other vehicles wire directly in, but you have to put a spare key in the unit and wrap it around the ignition. It made the install seem very half-a**ed. I could have just taped the key to the ignition at that point. I will get the immobilizer delete software instead of this junk. Thumbs down from me on at least VW and Audi application
To call this a bad machette would be to generous. It is more accurately described as a machette shaped object.  ---  --- As other have noted the blade is thin, too flexible, easily rusts, and fails to hold an edge. The handle is poorly made and mine had sharp edges where the handle halves were joined. If you use it without wearing gloves this "tool" will do more dammage to your hand than to the target vegetation.  ---  --- Th sheath material is 1 step above paper. Technically it will hold the machette on your belt. But if you draw the machette with anything other than utmost care you will cut the sheath.  ---  --- I can't believe a company with a valuable name like Coleman would put their brand on this embarassing piece of garbage.
I had the opportunity of wearing these for my husband before I left for the west coast and my annual visit with my friends and our second annual lingerie party. My hubby couldn't believe I'd wear something like this, but boy oh boy, he didn't object. He couldn't take his eyes off my, well you can just imagine what it was he couldn't take his eyes off of
My unit was really easy to install ... no wires just suction cups for the main unit and no tools required for the temperature unit.  I drive mostly during the day so I like the unit, but those who do night driving cannot see the DIM LIGHT. --- I had to remove unit in order to pass the VA state inspection. --- In cold weather, the temp guage sometimes does not work. --- Also, about the temp sensor ... If you place it too near the hot parts of the radiator it will not be accurate while driving in town or when stopped.  Behind the front license tag is great ... I put an old license tag under the new one and drilled holes to hold the temp sensor. That method works great. --- I really like the automatic calibration feature
I bought these skates last year, with the plans of putting outdoor wheels on them.  When I tried to take the wheels off, they wouldn't budge!  Spend the extra $50 on a pair of quality skates that you can keep for years.  When the  *indoor* wheels on these die, the skates die too.  These most definitely are not roller derby skates, since those girls change their wheels all the time!
I bought this Adapter because I could use the cable that came with iPOD, (one fewer thing to carry).  Well, about six months after opening this item, I noticed that my iPOD was running on battery.  One of the contacts had broken, and the device was not working anymore.  I am disappointed, but should have expected that for the $10 I spent. 
We just bought this for our 3 year old. --- I do not at all understand why it is labled for 5 and over!! --- Cute game idea-  --- But this was not well put together. --- First I about died when I saw the super cheap, barely cardboard gameboard!!!!!!! It is a VERY small board, set up like a 4 piece puzzle, that I predict will barely stay together after a few plays.   --- the jewelery, subpar.  the crown and rings are OK, the rest very cheap and plain.  But is serves it purpose just fine :).   --- I give this low marks for educational and durablity. --- BUT the jewlery box and spinner are a nice & durable!! If they put the same effort into the WHOLE game it may be worth buying. --- My daughter DID enjoy dressing up and playing a game together so that salvaged a star for the game.
This is a superb product that used to be found on most grocery store shelves.  Sadly, they disappeared from the shelves.  After an extensive internet search for the product, I was able to find them through Amazon.com and Gristede's Supermarket.  I ordered a case and they arrived in perfect shape and just as advertised.  When these are gone, I will certainly use this same procedure to order more
Spongebob IS  making an obscene gesture.  Personally, I don't think it is an appropriate toy for children.  Anyone that thinks Spongebob is merely "pointing" a finger shouldn't be so naive as to how toys are marketed and the moral decline of our society!!
I love these chips...they have a taste that gets better the more you chew them and they give you plenty of fiber and soy protein.  I wish they weren't as high in fat as they are, but they're good for a once in awhile indulgence
Seriously. You could just hold up a finger close to the camera lens and just wave it back and forth. That is a perfect way of cheating. The game is not bad after all.
I was unable to play in my car CD player, so --- only choice I got is to listen at home using my home DVD player.
Ah, the men's magazine. So many out there, where to draw the line when it comes to subscribing? Ultimately it boils down to what is worth the money you are shelling out, and for me, FHM is a cut above the rest for the following reasons. ---  --- 1. Articles are more intelligently written, less sophmoric, and delve on a wider array of issues. ---  --- 2. Paper quality is high glossy and sturdy, while other magazines feel like cheap pieces of newspaper by comparison. Paper feels like the same paper used by Playboy. ---  --- 3. Quality of women featured. FHM has by far a higher quality of women. Maxim tends to pull from a rung lower on the quality ladder, while FHM features beautiful, sexy, intelligent, and funny women whose interviews are actually readable. ---  --- 4. FHM Top 100 Women Special. Wow. Worth the money right there. ---  --- [...] --- Only negative with subscriptions is that these companies will send you last month's issue and count that as one of your 12 issues. That is annoying
  I like Machine Head a lot.  Many people disliked "The Burning Red" and called them sell-outs, but I appreciated the effort to make something different.  Then came "Supercharger".  I have listened to it a dozen times, looking for that hook or spark that will get me to listen and love it.  It never came.  This is a bad CD by a great band.
Its light was okay, although it could not quite cover an entire page of a book. The main problem is it's too shabby to survive a battery change--so you will get just 40 hours of use before it runs out. Also, finding 3V Lithium batteries is not easy.
This item is well made.  The tube is beefy and the handles are sturdy.  The included exercise booklets are lame. They have dated black and white photos showing disinterested people doing lack luster exercises. 
Richard Fortney's "Earth" is a survey, in mostly layman's terms, of the geological history of the Earth and how it relates to humankind.  Fortney tells the story by means of a journey around the earth, selecting a series of locations where the earth's geology is apparent, and usually the meaning of that geology was debated by scholars to a greater understanding.   ---  --- Fortney starts at Mount Vesuvius in Italy, preceeds to the Hawaiian Islands, hence to the Swiss Alps and to other locations aroudn the world.  Fortney relates the geology of each chosen location to plate tectonics as a means to explain how each terrain come to be the way it is.  This leads into extended and sometimes fascinating discussions of the former alignements of the continents in prior ages such as the "supercontinent" of Gondwana.  For each location, Fortney also relates the effects of the terrain on the history of the humans who have lived in that location.  Along the way, Fortney drives home the sheer vastness of the timescale of earth and its geological processes.  The dedicated reader will view his landscape with a new perspective. ---  --- Fortney is a gifted writer with a good eye for the illustrative anecdote.  Large portions of this book will be fascinating to the reader with at least some schooling in the sciences.  It turns out, for example, that the complicated geology of Newfoundland results from its origin as pieces of three different tectonic plates (North America, ocean bottom, and Northern Europe).  The descriptions of Northwest Scotland as the remains of truly ancient mountains are put into appropriate scale in part by Fortney's historical anecdotes and by his experiences of rockhounding in the often cold rainy weather of the Scottish Highlands. ---  --- The narrative runs a little long at over 400 pages, and Fortney's explanations will sometimes outrun the scientific background of the average reader.  Nevertheless, this book is highly recommended to the reader with at least a casual interest in geology and its links to human history
The Address label is wrong for proper delivery.  Has street address instead of Post Office Box
I can't stand this game after 5 minutes. The game is so unresponsive its not funny.  The first board I wanted to throw my remote. My friend watching asked me what the hell was going on. I seriosly didn't move the remote at all and my guy starts spinning around. At first I thought maybe the control calibration is wrong but then I was playing trauma center before and after Red steel and not once did i have a problem with the controls. Seriously the worst game i ever played
I have listened to a bunch of Dean Koontz books. While listening to the second one I saw so many similarities, which really turned me off. And this flaw continued which each book I listen to, which caused me to be reluctant to buy this book. However, most of the stories were pretty good so I stuck with him.  This is not the case with this book.  "Cold Fire" is absolutely horrible.  I so regret purchasing this book.  It is so bad that I have decided to swear off Dean for looooooooong while. ---  --- Just on a side note, "The Bad Place" is the first DK book I read and it was very entertaining.
I wasn't sure if it would be worth spending the money on this case. How wrong I was. If you're into diving and have one of these cameras, buy it now
The title gets it right - this is a very fun album. There are a lot of great songs on here. Infectious lyrics and music - it still surprises me that Matthew Sweet isn't more popular than he is. ---  --- One other thing...it's a sin that "We're The Same" wasn't a bigger hit than it was. Truly a great song
This is a wonderful gym.  It is similar to the boflex but without the HIGH pricetag.  Delivery was very fast.  I am very satisfied!
When i bought the resistance bands i thought they were going to be much bigger than i thought. i havent used them since i bought them...i sent in a questionairre sort-of-deal back to the company i bought them from requesting an exchange, but i havent heard a thing from them. i'm not very pleased.
That's the only way I can rate this product. If it taste great, then it gets a high rating from me
These are the best pads for the task...the ultra thin pads are great for during the day...they dont leak and are very breathable...the heavier flow pads are great for overnight protection depending on the amount of liquid that you are leaking.  i am now nursing my 2nd daughter and i will forever use these pads.  the variety pack also offers the best value for your dollar.  try every kind you get...samples are free so use them but when you have to buy these are the most natural and positivly the best.
spongebob's house party --- hall moniter --- I had an accident --- valentine's day --- just one bite --- mermaidman and barnacleboy --- tea at the treedome --- the paper --- born again krab
After having read the book and waiting in anticipation when it first came out, I was extremely disappointed.  The movie very well could be alright on its own merits, but the books plot is very different and much more suspenseful
Beware of this product.  It always freezes up half way though the download when transfering photos to my computer.  I have another USB 1.0 card reader that works perfectly.  I upgrade to get the speed boost with USB 2.0, but this product is fundamentally flawed and buggy
THE  QUALITY WAS GOOD AND THE STORIES WERE ALSO GOOD. I AM ON THE LIST WHEN THE FIRST SEASON COMES OUT. THIS IS LIKE A TEASE
I've had this battery for half a year and I agree with a fellow reviewer's assessment that the battery does not hold much power. I am diligent about expending all energy before recharging because they have memory, but this Delkin model's life span was noticeably short. Now i am going to buy a new charger/battery altogether because I don't want to buy another Delkin battery
For its size and price, this little light can't be beat. Very transportable and produces a dramatic influence on the image quality of evening shoots indoors. I think this is a must have for camcorder owners. My VHS family movies shot over 20 years ago are still a source of pure joy, so I see this as a miniscule investment for the long-term return.
Once again, spending a little more money for a product that does what it advertises is WORTH it. This is the only toner I have ever used that completely diminishes oil and shininess without over-drying my skin. I alternate with #3 depending on the weather
I echo most of the previous reviews. --- This Hayley Mills vehicle has little to do with the excellent Mary Stewart novel that it shares some of its title with.  Hayley was too young to be the novel's heroine, and so for this film the plot and romance were 'youthened', sanitized (though the novel's romance was also chaste) and also very much dumbed down.  As a featherweight Hayley Mills film, this is harmless, and very much a lesser- Disney film of the 60s.  Just don't expect this to be more than it is and you might enjoy it, even with your kids of today, as a retro laugh
Great taste and value!  It taste best with a high quality honey!  A must for tea drinkers
When I first heard of this game, I basically ignored it. Then, when I was visiting Gamestop one day, I decided to buy it. I was instantly amazed by the unique battle system, the bright and cheerful backdrops, (except for Twilight Town, that is) and the challenging and profound gameplay.  --- I have not played the first one, but I will probably get it from the virtual console on Wii. --- One problem with the game is that it's too short
I bought this set for my daughter. The bedding is such a poor quality, that my daughter won't sleep in her bed.  She says the sheets are itchy.  The comforter is so hard it is like a big piece of cardboard.  I WOULD NOT RECOMEND this set to anyone!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I ordered ZoneAlarm Internet Security Suite 2006 after a PC magazine review,   I have a 3 month old HP Media Center PC.   Th software totaly locked up my machine on install twice.   Each ocasion requireing me to reboot in safe mode and to use the restore function to even use my computer.   I lost 6 - 8 hours of work befoe I decided to return it.   I did receive my refund 8 to 10 weeks after returning the product.    I am now using Norton Internet Security with no problems.  I transfered it from an older abandoned PC. ---  --- I mave been a PC user since 82 and am fairly knowledge about hardware and software.   This is one of the few programs I could not instal.   I have used the free Zone Alarm Firewall without problems. ---  --- ew
My niece couldn't put this down after she opened it. She had lots of fun --- doing tricks for her relatives at Christmas. The components of the set  --- are very good quality. I patted myself on the back for discovering this --- "winner" gift
We just got it, I first gave it a 60 second shake and it worked fine, and I let it sit for a day and a half.  It lit up again without shaking so the capacitor holds the energy a very long time. Shaking it for over a minute continuosly gave me a bright shine that lasts pretty long. We are in the Caribbean with literally no electricity most of the time without even moonlight. This works perfectly.
The mouse is perfect for games. I use it to play ET and is great. The software provided by Logitech is configurable in all ways
Back when I was learning to play harmonica I tried many different styles and brands before discovering these Golden Melody harps.  I really like the sound they produce and the ease of "bending" notes, even for beginners.  I also really like the fact that all of the edges are rounded, making it much more comfortable on both your mouth and your hands.  I know many of the greats swear by the "Marine Band" harmonica, and to tell the truth I wish the Golden Melody had wood instead of plastic edges, but I choose this one as my favorire based on the results I get with it.   ---  --- Now as for the key of C...  I get a lot more use out of the keys of A and E, but thats another story..
I love how soft and cuddly this changing pad cover is.  I also appreciate how many colors it comes in. ---  --- What I am disappointed with is the durability.  I have 3 of these and have used them for just over a year.  They are totally falling apart at the elastic. Now, keep in mind that we use disposable "chucks" (those blue hospital disposable under pads) on top of this terry cloth changing pad.  It makes it less messy (especially early on) and doesn't require washing as much.  I also washed them in cold water with Baby Dreft detergent, hung them to dry and rotated the 3 covers that we have.   ---  --- While it is a nice product while it lasts, I just expected them to be more durable. 
After a few years of use, the original rack on my Gold C grill was rusty and unusable. This is the exact replacement and fits like the original, making the grill that much more usuable again.
Amazon must think we are fools. It's $4 cheaper directly from Stewart's website. ---  --- On the other hand, there appear to be a lot of fools here
The color is very pale and not very much not as vivid as the picture. Also, from the picture you think that it is high quality and fine threaded but the threads are large and not so apealing as the picture shows. Good customer support though I couldn't return it because of being a gift
I bought this camera like 7 months ago since it was so small and i liked the design....but the pictures it takes suck, specially in the night time or with flash, you can barely see what you are photographing. --- THe video feature its ok even though you cant change the zoom while making the video, but the design doesnt suit well this feature since the audio-in is in the exact same place where you are suppossed to hold the camera...so most of my videos dont have audio since i was blocking the audio entrace... --- Its small and portable, and i could fit it in any pocket, so thats good, but its so small that the battery lasts only aorund 90 min...that's what it says, but it keep going down like 5times faster than a regular min, so it only does last like 30 min
One of the first of the great Ealing comedies, and a clear indication that their comedies would carry social and political weight as well. In this picture a run-down section of London discovers a horde of burried treasure when a bomb left over from WW II explodes accidentally, and the residents of Pimlico, London, learn that they actually are a part of Burgandy, as deeded by the King in the 1400s. This means they are a separate country right in the heart of London, and they decide to act like a separate country. Thus they conclude that the laws of England don't apply anymore - but likewise England cuts them off, and Pimlico is under siege.  ---  --- The craziness of the situation leapfrogs, with passports now required, services cut, people throwing food over the barbed-wire fence to help them survive. It's a great satire on government and sovereignty. It's also an interesting look at post-war London, with its burned-out buildings still plentiful and ration books still in use (England felt very much at the short end of the stick after the war, the last of the allied countries to be under wartime restrictions and shortages). The script is terrific (typical for Ealing productions), and Stanley Holloway is wonderful as the leader of Pimlico. Definitely worth a watch
Joan. You don't love me. Because I'm a guy. But I have loved you since 1976. Ok so I'm an old man (age 43). So what. She's just the best rock and roll female on the planet. I like the young ones like Sahara Hotnights and the Donnas as well but they just don't measure up to Joan Born To Be Bad Jett. This album - like most of her other albums - consists of a mix of old and new songs. Doesn't mattar. I love it. And the video... well it confirms what we have always known. Not that it matters. The music matters
The graphics are clear, but they are bad! Horses look nothing like that and it is really gross! I would say get it for the younger kids, because they won't care. ---  --- There is nothing to do with the game except earn money, build your hotel, and keep your horse from getting sick. You don't get to ride that often because it said "you have ridden enough for this round" and it is very enoying. you can't pay enough monay to keep more than one horse, but you need to jump them to earn money so you can build your hotel / parking lot / jumping corse / breeding paddock / ect. But you can't do that unless you can jump the horse alot, and you can't. It is easy to go 'bankrupt' so I would say this game is not for little kids because of the money dealing. ---  --- not for older kids because of the dumbness of the horses look, not for younger kids because of the money problems. --- So don't get this game
The holster that Samsung supplies with their phone will not allow you to flip open the phone when phone is in the holster.  How stupid is that?   Why would Samsung supply this type of holster to their customers?  ---  --- However, this holster has solved that problem.  You can now flip open your phone when using this holster.  Thank yo
The click-stick applicator is ridiculous. You have no control over the shadow. When you click it, nothing comes out. You have to twist about ten times, and then, suddenly, a huge blob, enough for eighteen applications, comes busting out. The only way I've found to apply this is to use my own shadow brush dipped in this huge blob. I purchased three colors at the same time and all three tubes work in this same way. As far as the actual shadow, it's fine. Nothing spectacular. You could get the same product from Wet'N Wild for a buck.
This is a great cleaning system for anyone with high walls or vaulted ceilings.  Plus, all the attachments make cleaning very versatile.  I looked at a similar system listed in the Frontgate catalog -- and almost purchased it for more than $120.00.  Then I found this -- for less than $40.00.  It's great -- and I recommend it to anyone who likes to stay cobweb & dust free
When Foxfire first came out, I had no interest to watch it at all. Recently I became a huge Angelina Jolie fan. The main reason to watch the movie was her. Jolie is great as usual. She gives everything into her character and is very good. The reason that films like these don't get as much publicity as their male counterparts is because they are all are so stereotyped and labeled. And while the generalization about most "female bonding" films is true, the same could be said about the men. And what makes each film stand apart is the emotion and ideas of the characters. The plot is based on real life situations, and the characters and the charisma they deliver is what makes the film so liberating and exciting to watch. The girls are learning life lessons, growing up, experimenting, facing hard issues and learning to cope and understand each other.  ---  --- Angelina Jolie has some brilliant lines and poses as an almost Mother-like figure, affecting their lives forever, sheltering and explaining, and persuading the girls to take an extra risk, or risks, rather. It's very intimate and she does an incredible job playing "Legs". It isn't meant to represent what all girls do, and don't bother looking for a movie about lesbians guys. It gets very ethereal at points and made a point about bonding and unity. Don't bother looking for deep intellectual comments either, because the most poignant scenes are sullen and the actresses use their eyes over words.  ---  --- The opening scenes are good, the way they introduce the oppressed victims, and you see the wide-eyed looks as are often given by people who are afraid - but who will later look for comfort in Legs and her new-found posse. It is all set up very well. And the touching ending scenes provide closure, showing how very real, and sincere, everything has been. It's not sugar coated in any way and let's you take a glimpse into a female perspective that does not revolve around whether or not they have a boyfriend, and whether their hair and make-up look okay. And if at least 1 girl can watch a movie like that, or read a book like that, and be inspired enough to raise her self-esteem and not let anyone walk over her, then it has made a good impact. After all, it's simply not often movies about self-proclaiming girls rebelling get in this much of a spotlight, right?
300 plus minutes of recording time (without LCD). I still got several hours with the LCD, backlight on. ---  --- For when you are out all day, this is a good long lasting battery. ---  --- On the HDR-FX1 I found it preferable to the smaller and lighter battery as it helped provide a touch extra rear weighting. That helped balance when using the camcorder at hip height for me. I can't say I noticed the extra weight as an issue when using at shoulder height, though I didn't have it on my shoulder for long periods at a time
If you're looking for a professional office suite, MS Office 2007 has no real competitors. I've worked extensively with Corel Office and some with Open Office. They're fine for the basics, and they cost less. But if you're looking for effectiveness, integration, speedy productivity, and an incredible array of tools, you'll want to buy MS Office 2007. And as an added bonus, the interface makes it a pleasure to work in
I had several friends INSIST that I rent this film. I'm glad I did instead of buying it. I was not bowled over as they obviously were - quoting lines from it and all but wetting themselves remembering scenes from the film. ---  --- Now, I'm not a hard guy to make laugh, but there was only one point in this film where I actually laughed out loud. Other than that, I found Sordid Lives to be just tediously amateurish and more than a bit forced. ---  --- I love Southern humor and even poking fun at Southerners: I can't tell you how much I love Greater Tuna, Fried Green Tomatos, Steel Magnolias, etc. but this just didn't cut it for me. ---  --- The cast is a who's who of excellent character actors: Beau Bridges, Bonnie Bedelia, Leslie Jordan, Olivia Newton-John (for pete's sake!), Erik Krieger, Delta Burke and gobs of others. No, it's not a shortage of talent that this film lacks. I found that it was a lack of a cohesive direction that made me wince more than once. ---  --- There's a scene with Ty (an out of the closet to everyone but his parents young man who lives in West Hollywood) talking to his ex-girlfriend in the reception area of their therapist...well, as a theatre director, I can only tell you that the performances during this one scene are so painfully badly acted and the pregnant pauses between the lines are so large you could drive fleets of trucks through them. ---  --- There are various filming techniques that Del Shores (the director) uses that are just hackneyed: filming from behind a person's back so that only the back of one person's head and the facing person are seen. Why? It feels like a testimonial "video" from MTV's Real World rather than an actual film. ---  --- Frankly - and this is not always a bad thing - the whole film felt like it was a play converted to film. It can be a great thing! Look at Altmans' Come Back to the Five and Dime Jimmy Dean and you'll see how a good stage to film movie is done. But this...well, it's just amateur hour from my perspective. ---  --- In all, the film felt like a poor man's Greater Tuna (two quick change artists playing 16 characters living in Texas' 3rd smallest town), which WAS a stage play and WAS filmed for HBO as a stage play rather than attempting to make it FEEL like a film. ---  --- I wanted to like this film, but I just didn't
 I read this book for a project two years ago. I wasn't about to finish this book and had to move to another one. First off, this book lacks emotion. This character is so boring. She doesn't seem to ever feel sad or mad and to me, a book without emotion is just unreadable. I hated this book, but I don't like most Scott O'Dell books. Just go read another book
My subscription is expiring in a few days and this suite is impossible to renew.  They are trying to force you into 2006 security suite for the big bucks and buggy software.  2005 works fine until I have been thru the runaround 3 times with e-mail customer support.  I won't pay for their telephone customer support, trend micro will force me to buy another brand because of this.  Shame on you pcillin
When I first got this disc the other day, it would not play at all. I installed the latest firmware update to my XBOX360 HD drive, and it played. However, it does not play well at all. The video is constantly "dragging" or skipping. The audio is fine though.  ---  --- I can't really provide a review of the content since, so far, it is unwatchable. ---  --- This is the only disc that has given me issues
I bought this for my boyfriend as a present. We both love the TV show and thought the game would be as exciting (without the live crowd, of course). But the game moves slow, no models - only picking case numbers. You can compete against one another, but its not really exciting.  ---  --- Maybe you should try the board game version - it can't be any worse.
I have owned this camera for ~6 months and have finally deciced to replace it. I bought this camera to replace another Nikon CoolPix that was stolen from my house. But this one does not have a view finder to begin with and is way more complicated to use. I have always liked Nikon cameras but the S9 just doesn't make it. I can not use it outside because I can not see the LCD screen. Sorry Nikon but you blew it on this camera!! --- So I replaced it with a Canon PowerShot A710. What a difference in ease of use and... it has a view finder. also my 1G memory card from rhe Nikon fots in the new Canon.
This thing does not stay in place. I needed a sponge to prop it up. Also don't let the chrome finish fool ya. It's plastic all around and feels cheap. Right now this is in a box going right back where it came from. No good.  --- 
I had this heart rate monitor for 7 days.  The first couple of days it worked fine then it just stopped transmitting.  I tried everything and it just did not work.  The watch itself was fine.  I ended up sending it back and paying the little bit extra for a polar.
Ordered shoe in my usual size; shoe was too tight.  Bealls does not have an exchange policy whereby they will ship a different size at no charge; so I returned the shoes and got credit for the purchase, but not for shipping both ways
 I usually use Adaware to scan my computer weekly, and like others, I would like to try the trial version Spyware Doctor to scan my computer. The result was, I had more than 200 infections! I was amazed that my other virus scan programs didn't catch any of these infections, and my computer had been running properly. Of coz, I would like to remove these infections and so I paid with my creditcard and got the License No.  ---  --- After entering the License No. and Scanning, I continued to remove the infections that spyware doctor had caught. Before clickinig the remove button,I checked what I would delete and the files SEEMS OK to be deleted.  I had to restart my computer in order to complete removing the infections. I clicked YES to restart. ---  --- From then, my nightmare began, I couldn't start my computer AT ALL!!! Not even displaying the loggin window! My computer just kept restarting again and again.  After 5 times restarting automatically, I smelled something burning from my computer!!! I was so scared becoz there are some important files that i haven't backup yet!  ---  --- Endup, I reformat my computer!!! I couldn't login my old account again! Now, I have a new administrator account and lost all the softwares that i orginally have. Luckily I was able to reinstall 70% of the softwares (you gotta know the serial no. for most of the softwares are not working after reinstall, and that took me long time to find ways reinstalling them, and NOT all of them!) Some of my important files couldn't be opened again because I don't have the softwares to open them!  ---  --- I was/am still so mad about this! The spyware doctor removed my system operating files and that's why i couldn't restart my computer. Yet, i reinstalled spyware doctor again because I paid and only used it once. However, I couldn't use it after reinstalling like other softwares.  Even i followed the instruction online to reenter the licence no. that i purchased, it's just simply not working (the website said i don't have to repurchase and it should work!) ---  --- So i Paid $10 , only used the spyware doctor once, but I lost all other softwares that cost totally more than $400
I haven't tried this item yet as the weather hasn't cooperated.  But the service was great.  I ordered it as a last minute Christmas item, and got it in time to make my recepient happy. Thank
If I could give it negitive stars I would! We bought two of these gates due to a couple of very wide openings that needed to be secured. These gates are horrible and very poorly designed. Every time someone tries to open the gate, it sags and pulls the wood dowels out of the frame and it completely falls apart! We have older children that have had to resort to crawling over it to get into the living room just to avoid its eminent collapse. And often it collapses anyway. Now my 11 month old son has figured out that if he shakes the gate at the joint he can pull it completely apart and crawl right through. Now we have to purchase new gates that actually work to replace these.
Got a very similar model at a Babies R Us several months ago, but without the adult's handle. My son is almost 2 and can almost pedal by himself, and we generally like the style, but the trike tips so easily that I rarely take it out for him to use. Never would have thought to check this but I'll be in the market for a big-wheel type trike or one that is much more stable than this model.
Much better versions out there, and it is always better to pay a little more and get the good one, then conserve, for a disposable mode
bought these to replace the factory blades on my mazda3.   very, very happy with these blades, the difference is unbelievable.  installed easily, look great, and get rid of water so much more effectively than the blades i replaced. 
Although this worked well on some of my blackheads, I felt it was very harsh to my skin.  I was worried that using it would create even more scars.  I would not buy this product again. 
Well it's not quite as good as Rising which is the best album ever but it's still amazing. ---  --- 1.Man On The Silver Mountain- 10/10 This track is a classic and is still played at every Dio concert and Ritchie Blackmore still performed it at every Rainbow concert until Rainbow disbanded in 1997 but anyway this may be Ritchie Blackmore's strongest riff ever! and Dio's vocal performance is excellent. Anyway it's a great fantasy song by Dio and Blackmore and still got radio play so it appeals to everyone. ---  --- 2.Self Portrait- 10/10 Excellent dark song by the band which fits Dio's voice perfectly another classic! ---  --- 3.Black Sheep Of The Family- 8/10 Good song but not a Rainbow song it's a cover and that's a shame because I would have loved to hear Dio's brilliant lyrics another original song but anyway still a good listen ---  --- 4.Catch The Rainbow- 10/10 Another classic from this album as Dio shows how well he can sing ballads as well as epics and rockers. Blackmore has a solo full of feeling and this was performed at every Rainbow concert until Dio left the band. ---  --- 5.Snake Charmer- 10/10 Another song that takes place in the middle ages which is Rainbow's trademark. Anyway this song is very underrated and should have been a classic. Dio has brilliant lyrics and vocals as usual and it's no suprise that Blackmore supplied excellent solos and riffs for this one ---  --- 6.Temple OF The King- 10/10 Here is the best ballad of all time!!! Ronnie's vocals are perfect for this song and his lyrics are amazing too. Blackmore throws togethor and a great arrangemant and solo aswell to make this maybe the best track on the album. ---  --- 7.If You Don't Like Rock N Roll- 8/10 Kind of cheesy lyrics but a good track and it sounds more like an Elf track. ---  --- 8.Sixteenth Century Greensleeves- 10/10 Great song! A real classic as Dio puts togethor another great fantasy song. Blackmore's riffs is brilliant and his solo is full of bends and shredding. ---  --- 9.Still I'm Sad- 10/10 Well the version with vocals is much than this instrumental version but this version is brilliant too. The live version off On Stage however with Dio's vocals blow it away. I still wonder why there weren't any vocals on this. ---  ---  --- The band is ---  --- Ronnie James Dio- vocals --- Ritchie Blackmore- Guitar --- Gary Driscoll- Drums --- Mickey Lee Soule- Keyboards, Piano, Mellatron --- Craig Guber- Bass ---  --- 2
the high walls on the snuggle nest made it impossible to try to breast feed over, and pulling the baby down to the open area as suggested, defeats the purpose of having the walls in the first place.  I would fall asleep breastfeeding and wake up later only to realize my daughter was unprotected. 
QuickBooks lives up to it's reputation of being the one-size-fits-all small business book keeping software.  It does what you want it to do.  I like the feature of being able to easily sent e-mail invoices.  If you need the software right away it is just as cheap at the office supply stores
this game has a 25 minute introduction or story.  Square Enix was really creative and the stories are so good!  However I do expect them to put something like "Skip Intro" cause impatient people could really get mad at the stories!  I, however only get a game every five months so I am fine with that.  This is only a minor flaw.  Another flaw is that when you want to look at the map or statistics, you have to wait 5 seconds until it appears.  Very annoying, but again a minor flaw.  This game depends on how much you like to battle the same creatures over and over and over again!  It get very boring after awhile.  You have to train those dumb spirits and sometimes you just want them to level up quicker.  This game gets very boring after awhile and you will want to ditch the game as well as the characters.  There is not much action and you have a limited amount of monsters to battle.   ---  --- 1.0 ~ 3.5----- terrible --- 3.6 ~ 5-----bad --- 5.1 ~ 6.5-----average --- 6.6 ~ 8-------good --- 8.1 ~ 9------great --- 9.1 ~10------must buy excellent! ---  ---                     graphics- 9/10  great ---                     sound   -9/10   some voice acting but great ---                     fun   -   5/10  depends on how patient you are and how you react to battling the same monster over and over again ---                                    average- about 8 ---  ---                                   my grade-   7   goo
I'm not sure what took me so long to get it, but I'm just coming across this album.  It never made a blip on my radar I guess.  Anyway, I saw it at a local record store in the used bin for $2.00 and it was hardly used -- even the jewel case was flawless (it looked like it was only played once and then taken back to the store).  Obviously the owner before me didn't know what they had on their hands and the store manager didn't know either due to it's low price tag.  Balance is a must have album without question.  It came out in '03, I'm just getting it here in late '05 and it still sounds fresh.  There are so many bangers on this album that listing them would make this a five paragraph review.  Of the 16 joints (including the bonus track), I'd have to say that 14 of them are amazing.  Akrobatik rhymes with an honesty and realism that is rarely heard in rap (even amongst underground emcees).  The songs compliment and play off of each other without them all sounding the same.   ---  --- I did mention that there were two songs that I could've done without.  Those songs are "Hand That Rocks The Cradle" and "Always Bet On Ak".  They aren't bad, but I find myself skipping them everytime I play this CD. ---  --- Balance is a must have LP.  I still feel a bit cheated since I just found out about this album.  There has to be some sort of promotion for this guy.  I did get the Black Dialogue (Perceptionists) album and I knew about The Lost Adats and The EP, but somehow I completely missed this one.  Don't be like me, if you haven't heard this yet, grab it as soon as you can.  You won't regret it.  This is one of the best albums on 2003.  Highly reccomended. ---  --- Standout Tracks: Time, Woman II, Remind My Soul, Balance, Hypocrite, Limelight, Front Days, Here & Now, Wreck Dem feat. Mr. Lif, Cooler Heads, Feedback feat. Diamond D, and Bone Crushe
I don't want to spoil this movie for others and I won't. CACHE is French for HIDDEN and  alot was left hidden. Why does the son suddenly do what he did? Why does he think his mother is doing what he thinks she's doing? I didn't care one bit about any of the charactors. This is a slow going movie with no conclusion. If you have a choice between watching this movie or watching paint dry, flip a coin. I watch international films often and usually fnd them more rewarding than most US made films. Not this one.
I have given this as a gift to both my husband and father-in-law. They are both very handy and own older homes. It is perfect. I even enjoy reading my husbands for organizational tips
So I received my Go-510 and expected it to work right out of the box.  It powered up, great windshield adapter, no problems with the connections, bluetooth works perfectly, Ipod controls - no problem.  Just one thing, NO SATELLITE FIX !!  It would not lock on - even after one hour in the open sky.  I thought, here goes....bad tech support....ship it back... --- But no.  I called tech support, got through to a human (very knowledgable) in only 20 seconds.  Problem was fixed by upgrading firmware and the unit works perfectly.  I read on many sites of the problems plaguing these units.  Apparently, they have all the bugs out because every aspect, every feature is cool and workable.  The TomTom Go-510 is highly recommended in my book and mad props to the tech support crew - way to roll
I am so glad I found these. My son (22 months old) is crazy about these apples and I can't find them at the store any more. They have a really great flavor and texture. They are very different than traditional dried fruit. The apples are plump and actually look like they came from an apple
I've been using StriVectin-SD for almost two years.  There isn't a day that goes by that I don't get a complement on my skin.  I don't wear any make up, aside from lipstick.  My skin alway glows and the fine lines are hardly visible.  I'm in the beauty business and I recommend this product to my customers.  I am NOT a spokesperson for the company, only a happy and satisfied customer
I think his debut had the best lyrics. This joint gets off to a good start with We Still Party and pretty much bangs till the end. His production on here is best described as "Late 90's Roger Troutman-esque G-Funk".  --- Geust Stars like 2nd II NOne, AMG, Suga Free and El Debarge get their shine on. ---  --- Top Joints: --- We Still Party  (Peter Gunz and Quik on the track) Quik jacks the VERB song from School House Rock. (The Jam) --- So Many Wayz   --- Hand In Hand  --- You'z A Ganxta  (Quik refutes rumors that he was involved in Biggie's demise. Also denounces reference to death in rap songs.) --- I Useta Know Her (Should be called I Useta Hit That) --- Speed   --- Medley for a 'V' (The P***y Medley)   --- Get 2Getha Again (Class of 91, 2nd II None, AMG and Quik triple team on this track.)   --- Reprise (Medley For A 'V)
I started taking Anxietol 7 to help me with my stress at work. I am not usually a stressed out sort of person however I recently got transfered to NYC and I'm from Utah, just that move itself is enough to stress anyone out. I am working as a trader and it is very high energy. Anxietol 7 is helping me cope with my new life here
The American Spectator is a must read for anyone considering themselves an intellectual. Not only are the articles witty and well-researched, they also provide well-articulated arguments to the most pressing (if sometimes slighlty out of date) controversies of the times. Well worth the subscription price, or even the cover price
I bought this pump and used it on three bikes, a total of 5 tires before the foot pedal bent, then broke.  If you need a pump, I suggest going to a bike store and paying for a good one.  I tried to go the inexpensive route and learned my lesson.  Bell products are cheaply made and don't last beyond a few uses.  Don't make my mistake and disappoint your kids on a Sunday when there's nothing you can do about it except to drive to the nearest gas station for air.  Stay away from this, and other "pedestrian" pumps.  Makes you wonder what a Bell helmet will look like after a spill
They are a great quality, comfortable boot. And the price was far less than local stores. The shipping at regular rate took over a week, though
I had one of these when they first came out and loved it.  This one is even better.  I would say it's a must have for someone that has trouble getting a steak medium rare.  Since purchasing this item, I once again have the perfect steak.  I am so glad I found this fork again.  I am one happy person
I'm writing this reveiw on the company, Discount Ramps, rather than the ramps themselves. They charged my credit card immediately upon ordering, then 6 weeks later when I inquired about where these ramps were, they told me the manufacturer hadn't received the metal to build them yet, and the build time is 4-6 weeks. Just be careful, people
No bells, no whistles -- Just an action figure with its' own four-wheeler.  It can capture the mind of a car-obsessed 6 year old boy for an hour at a time at least :-)  Some of the objects that the action figure is supposed to hold don't stay in his hand very well, but oh well -- it seems that all my nephew wanted to do was crach the thing anyway!  And it takes that quite well.
I have got a virus that cause files "comment.htt" appeared in many folders and my previous antivirus can detect them but can not destroy that virus. I tried to use another 2 antiviruses but not effective. So I try KAV and it works! Also KAV does not slow my computer like some big-named antivirus. Autoupdate feature is cool. We do not have to click anything and the prize is reasonable
This product is so good. I love it! I can make my own MP3's, make disk copies and archive data files.  --- I'm curious to see how DVD movies are made with this product. I'm very happy with this item. The price is very pleasing as well.
Ummm.... Why should I pay 20 dollars for this when it comes free in a 5 dollar comic book
I gave G collection to my wife.   --- It's perfect Valentine present for her! --- Most of chocolates are fruit-based but very unique and fresh. --- I'm not a big fan of chocolate but this one is amazing
My children love Smart Puffs.  I love the smaller packages for school lunches. 
My first digicam, bought it 2 years ago.  --- Simple to use, great pictures, and a year ago (and hundreds of pictures ago) I dropped it (no in its case) on a cobblestone road - no damage. --- Have never seen the need to replace it. --- I like the common batteries it uses and the SD memory
Absolutely the easiest upgrade of a Microsoft OS that I've ever done, & as a retired hardware engineer, I've done a lot in the past. It's one sweet OS
If you have a Mac, and are having difficulties with this dvd, here are some tips. ---  --- Are you opening it with Preview?  If you just click on the icon on the disk, it will open in Preview... but this will not work properly.  You must use Adobe Reader to see the pages without the watermark. ---  --- Install Adobe Reader from the dvd. --- Make an alias of Adobe Reader and put it in the Dock. --- Click and open the dvd icon. --- Click and open the decade folder. --- Don't open the year folder... click and drag the pdf icon, (such as FF_1960.pdf... I have the Fantastic Four dvd, so substitute whatever is appropriate), onto the Reader alias in the dock to open. --- Click on year. --- Click on month. --- Click on the magnifing glass icon to zoom to any size. ---  --- I hope this is helpful
This Movie was very hard to find. Found it in DVD an it was new
I bought this as a gift for my son-in-law.  He loves it.  Got it for him 2 years now.  Easy gift buying, and he enjoys a present I bought him all year.
Now let's get its effectiveness out of the way so we can talk about that love it or hate it scent! It is a really thick conditioner and works great every other day or every few days. I have really long hair and this tames it and smoothes my split ends, and it leaves my hair shiny. It isn't greasy at all.  ---  --- If you are used to drugstore or salon conditioners, don't judge the effectiveness of any natural conditioner for a month. That is how long it can take for the silicones in mainstream conditioners to leave your hair (silicones are all those things in conditioner that end in "cone", like dimethicone, etc). Detoxing your hair off silicones is well worth it though, my hair is much healthier and shinier without that buildup. ---  --- So the scent: It is green, kind of melon and fresh, with a hint of violet (like Bathos, Gratuitous Violets, and Daddyo) to it. It took some getting used to, and when I first got it I thought it smelled of green beans or some vegetable-like smell. But when you use it and rinse it out, you are left with a rich green scent, with the tiniest hint of gently floral violet.  ---  --- It isn't for everybody, but if you buy it, give it a chance to work its magic in your hair before you make your judgement, because that lovely violetty smell combined with how well it works makes it kind of addictive. I use it with Daddyo shampoo to enhance that hint of violet and the fresh green scent I get from it. I use it in rotation with American Cream which is a bit lighter
I ordered the gourmet sampler and am very pleased with both the freshness and taste! (My box had 3 ice packs to keep the bakery chilled, plus plenty of foam peanuts so there was no breakage or crushing.) ---  --- I had first tried a muffin from a local retailer, but wanted an idea of other Chatila products. Granted, when anything is sugar-free, it doesn't taste just like the "original". But the items I recieved were close enough that I don't feel like I'm missing out on anything.  ---  --- I follow a diet, for medical reasons, that is low in sugar and high in protein. These products balance both nutritionally without sacrificing taste.  My first bite of the chocolate donut (the first donu I've had in 20 months) was great. I can enjoy treats now that I thought I'd never be able to eat again
I could not find these slippers in our local stores.  I had two pair that were worn out and wanted exactly the same item.  I ordered them, they arrived and I love them.  It was a very easy, customer friendly process
I loved the game and the side scrolling was a nostalgic step back in time for me.  The game play was difficult at times.  Honestly, I beat the a game in less than 2 weeks (with a grad student schedule and immunology test in the middle).  Finishing everything completely (all levels and all star coins) was a challenge in and of itself.  But it reminded me of the GTA series because after you beat the game there is really nothing to do anymore in the mushroom kingdom.  ---  --- The minigames are amazing time wasters.  I find myself playing them when waiting 5 minutes for other people etc.  I have had limited experience with the multiplayer, but it was VERY fun of you have a friend with a DS.  ---  --- Best feeling- seeing the 3 stars next to my saved game and getting to level 176 of the 'where's waldo' minigame
This upgrade is worth every penny.  I agree with the reviewer that felt that heating was more even.  I would add that they seem to burn the drippings off better and keep the inside of the grill cleaner.  There is no doubt in my mind that the addition of this product makes the original design all the better
Used Norton antivirus the last 3 years. getting product in tax software promotions.  No problems until I installed 2007 6 days ago, when my system became really slow and then I was unable to access the internet.  Since their customer service phone number is not in the User Guide but buried in their website, I was thankful my husband's laptop was available. The first rep became exasperated when his scripted suggestions did not resolve my problem after 1.25 hours and tersely told me he was sending me an email file that would solve my problems.  I had identified it was the Worm Protection causing the problem so I turned that off, accessed the file and ran it.  My computer updated twice with no change - if the Worm Protection was on, I wasn't going to be able to access the internet.      ---  --- Worked up my patience and called that evening, only to hold for 48 minutes.  Finally got another native of India who spoke English worse than the first guy. At one point, we were waiting on a restart and I asked her a question about the computer being slower with the 2007 version and she responded, "OK, yes".  Long story short, I hung up an hour later with a link for an update to the 2007 product which I was assured would solve the problem and an email address for her manager. During these two calls, the software was uninstalled, reinstalled, and tested and I spent several hours using the online support.  I updated the product and it worked for a couple hours.  Then I was right back where I began, unable to access the internet unless I turned off the Worm Protection. ---  --- I started the day with 360 days remaining on my subscription but once I updated, the protection center now says my subscription is expired. When I check my Norton account online, it shows I have almost a year remaining before expiration and all their tips to update the proection center have pathetically failed. ---  --- Sent an email to the management address I was given, but of course, haven't heard anything.  I am uninstalling this product and will never use Norton again. ---  
Great, safe and nice looking bumper!  I would recommend it without hesitation
The bad news first: The extension cables are VERY stiff, and they're shipped in a tight loop. Don't expect them to straighten out easily. And they don't come with extra clips to attach them to the foot straps. I just swap cables from whichever Bowflex station I'm not using and get a much better feel.  ---  --- The ball ... is a ball. It does the job. The little pump they supply with it isn't great, but it also does the job. Maybe you'll tone your arms pumping up the ball. ;-) There's no check valve in the ball, so be prepared to get the pump out and the plug in FAST, once it's fully inflated.  ---  --- The mat looks a bit cheap, but it's comfortable and it does keep you from sliding around. ---  --- The video is decent. Even if you already know what you're doing, it's worth watching to see how to do the moves using a Bowflex. ---  --- So far, I wouldn't say you've even come close to justifying the purchase price. But those foot straps are just BRILLIANT! Once you've gotten them adjusted, they'll go on and off with no problem, making it easy to add stretches to a regular workout without losing your momentum. But once you have them secured they won't come off, or even shift much, when you're performing the exercises. That may sound like no big deal, but I've used straps that took forever to put on and wandered all over the place while doing the movements. The four points for cable attachment are well-placed and solid. I've been doing resistance stretches for a LONG time, and these are the best straps I've ever used. They're worth the price of admission
So...I bought this for our 7 month old.  What a nightmare.  What the previous posters said about this thing is TRUE.  It is hard to get it to STAY PUT in the cart while you put your kid in it. It just doesn't happen.  And then...when you DO get your baby in, the seat portion is so narrow that it barely is the width of your child's hind end.  Forget the bar cover.  It is just as narrow.  This thing covers just that small area and if you have a child like mine, they are reaching over and touching EVERYTHING.  To add to it, the back cusion part doesn't even go up to the top of the back support.  My daughter totally whacked her head on the back of the cart seat and screamed.  The cusion part totally doesn't cover it.   ---  --- Just bad.  Just spend the extra cash and buy something that covers the whole darn cart
When we brought this home and took it out of the box we were rather impressed with the sleek design and the Cisco label. When we got it all hooked up all our dreams of surfing the internet at the speed of light turned into nightmares with constant connection drops and NO TECH SUPPORT! ---  If you read the boards on the Linksys site you'll see that there are no end of connection failures across many different ISP's and areas of the US since this item has been released. PLEASE don't waste your money on this worthless hunk of garbage, you'll end up sucking down 2 bottles of ibuprofen and a 12 pack of your choice before the night is even through
I was very surprised at how well this sub articulates the low frequencies.  Hearing is believing.  It gives a certain amount of accuracy and tangibility to base tones that I simply was not able to obtain with a higher priced sub I had purchased.  For movies, it does a wonderful job of augmenting the atmosphere of scenes without being too boomy.  It really enhances music by bringing out lower notes and sounds that are not normally perceived with the use of most other subwoofers on the market.  I am not certain it can go as low as 27Hz since I have not measured, but I am not concerned with trying to disturb the neighbors or shake the walls.  I just wanted to obtain the most precies and best sounding system I could.  I was able to do so with the addition of this sub.  I am glad I found and tried it before paying much more for another sub I was considering. ---  --- Yet I hate the fact that it is advertised as being a 250-watt sub.  Its Peak Dynamic Power is 250 watts.  But the amplifier it contains is a 150 watt amplifier.  Therefore, it is a 150-watt sub
I agree with the other people who wrote a review...can't figure out the sequence of events or maybe stylus does not work.  Child not happy and tired of hearing Shortcake say the same thing over and over.  Save your money and buy a good book for your kid!!
I bought this to clean up all of my kids DVDs. They have a ton of discs that are dirty, scratched, etc. I have cleaned over 30 discs so far and have fixed all but one (it was *really* scratched up). ---  --- I am suprised at the negative reviews on this item since I have considered this one of my smartest buys this year
The CS70 is an excellent product, easy to setup and use and good battery life
This is another piece of lowbrow anti-German propaganda dressed as historiography. ---  --- The book is a mess of primary, yet selective and biased historical research, simplistic psycho-babble, ridiculous sociological-anthropological speculation, pathetic organization behavioural theorising and last but not least, absolutely third rate military history. The author is hell bent on proving that there is a German Sonderweg from the founding of the Second Reich to Hitler, that the vaunted German Army is nothing but foolish automatons predisposed to atrocities and mindless offensives. ---  --- All in all, cheap trash billed as history. --- 
LISTEN UP!!! ... L'OCCITANE SHEA 24 HOUR ULTRA RICH FACE CREAM 1.7 OUNCE- HAS THE SAME MOISTURIZING RESULTS- FOR A FRACTION OF THE COST!!!- :)
Becareful it is a ballpoint pen but the picture was misleading. so have to return it
Moleskine makes great, sturdy, compact notebooks.  It has a convenient pocket in the back for sticking scraps of paper, a photo, whatever.   ---  --- I have a small ruled Moleskine I've used for years as a general purpose notebook.  It's taken quite a beating, but still looks to last until it's full.   ---  --- Since I purchased that first book at the Smithsonian in 2002, I've purchased, used and abused several different styles of Moleskines.  Each exhibits the same high level of quality, from the sturdy cover, strong, durable elastic 'clasp', and tough, heavy paper.
I use this on the ocasional hormonal breakout and it is super. It is easy to apply, goes on clear and is very powerful. It works to clear up that spot in record time. I'd highly recommend it
My five year old wanted drums for christmas so my dad got her this. she loves it and so do we. it has volume control and you can use head phones with it. It has good sound and so far isnt driving me nuts. she hasn't had any of the problems other people described with thiers
It never worked as advertised and total quit working after about two months. Don't buy, you've been warned
We bought 2 of these chairs used at a garage sale, after longing for the full-priced versions at stores.  We love these chairs, but given they had had a lot of use before we bought them, one of the chairs broke recently b/c of the cords fraying over time.   ---  --- The good news is that I easily ordered replacement cords online by just searching on google for Lafuma replacement cords-  and for $19, I will have a like-new chair again (rather than replacing the chair for $150+).  So for those of you worried about the durability feature of the cording, worry no more
Budget Travel is a quite a neat colorful magazine and is loaded with exotic far-away landscapes that do what they are designed to and give one a lift into dreamland. I also like some, not all, of their articles which tend to be well prepared and nicely written. ---  --- However, at the same time, it does need better organization as compared with (Horrors)Conde Nast. ---  --- I am diverting a bit but you may as well know that accessing your web site is impossible - I cant access it!!
I found I did enjoy this movie, even though the director took liberties. It doesn't follow so much the novel by Jane Austen, but if you haven't read the book and are unable to do the comparisons, this movie is enjoyable. I gave 4 stars because of the liberties taken by the director, but did like what I saw
As I read this book, When Madeline Was Young, I felt as though I was lost, wandering through a forest, searching for something - a beautiful butterfly, a perfect flower, a mystical cottage.  But there's nothing there.  It's just a forest full of a confusing tangle of leaves and vines and nothing mystical at all. And that's how this book is written.  It is a tangle of thoughts and words, spread from the first page to the last.  Nothing special at all.   ---  --- I've read all of Jane Hamilton's books.  I loved The Book of Ruth.  Adored A Map of the World.  They were both wonderful and I will always have positive comments for them, but I doubt I will ever buy another book by Ms. Hamilton.  It's not that I want a "formula" book.  But I do want to read something that I can relate to and I don't relate to this at all.   ---  --- I don't like Mac, the narrator.  His mother is just plain strange and not endearing or believable at all.  I can't stand Buddy, his cousin.  The rest of the characters I barely know and, quite frankly, don't want to get to know.  Perhaps I've changed since her first book came out.  Perhaps the author has.  But whatever the differences, my love of Jane Hamilton's books has ended.  Sadly
When I first spray Inis Energy of the Sea Cologne Spray, I could not smell any thing! Then I spray more and more 'till I found out how it smells! It has nice scent, Okay, I'll tell you how I found it; it is not bad!  --- BUT despite that, it doesn't last for more than half an hour, and then it hardly can be smelled. You may need to have it with you all the time and spray every half hour. This is what disappointed me the most! --- I am telling you my taste here, that isn't necessarily yours. --- 
These are a great substitute for granolia bars and much better for you.  They are not based on grains but on greens instead.  Taste is a tad bit green but if you eat whole foods at all then you'll love these.  -Plus they give a good energy boost throughout the day! 
The cream is great. It instantly gets absorbed  after application and i believe helps over time close up leakage of blood capilleries (which causes black circle appearences). I suffered from chronic dark circles. This cream after 1 month of application has considerably lightened my dark circles and has reduced puffiness. I would suggest anyone who is looking for an effective cream give this product a shot. considering my condition i still have light dark circles left and hope this cream will continue to benefit me. I still have doubts on this cream totally brightening my skin tone around my eyes, but never the less I find it effective
I bought this car for my 4 1/2 year old son who absolutely LOVES the movie Cars.  He also loves those Hot Wheels cars.  I got him this car, and he really liked it.  In fact, all of my kids (ages 4-15) like it!  It's a really cute toy.  It's even great if you are a Cars collector
I found a package of these berries first at Costco in Arvada, Colorado and found these to be the BEST dried fruit I've ever had.  I've since requested at my local Costco (Honolulu, Hawaii) that they carry these and I keep waiting and waiting.  I was thrilled to find these on the Amazon website and ordered four bags right away. ---  --- Thank you for carrying it
This game when released was the best 1st person shooter console game available. But today with  doom and half life versions for xbox, there is actually something to compare halo to, and it doesn't stand up.  ---  --- First off, the plot is utterly pointless. I never felt invested or sympathetic to master chief, just frustrated when he died that I would have to replay a section. ---  --- The weapons are lame. Released after the PC version of quake iii, halo's weapons seem limp in comparison. None of the "futuristic" aspects seem particularly believeable or useful, for that matter. ---  --- The vehicles suck. Driving the vehicles in Halo is as fun as operating a forklift, which is actually quite entertaining in GTA san andreas, so maybe it is not quite that fun. I guess it is more like driving that "super action wacky bike" from the southpark "chimpocoman " episode. ---  --- 2 player story mode rules! the best part of the game and the only reason to reccomend it is it is a great game to play with a friend. ---  --- multiplayer deathmatch is average. Give halo props for the first decent multiplayer battle for xbox, but it wasn't as good as it's PC competition when it came out- The much older quake III still looked and played better- and now seems OK but no better than most. ---  ---  --- That said the 2 player campaign and multiplayer make this a good 10-15$ diversion, just don't expect the immersive atmosphere of doom III or the intriguing plot twists of half life,  ---  --- 
I first saw this film while taking four years of Russian in high school. Regardless of whatever else may be said about it, the film certainly gets its point across. ---  --- Russia is consistently portrayed as the victim. The aggressions of the Swedes, the Tatars, and now the Germans are recounted. Not surprisingly, no mention is made of the times that Russia was the aggressor.  ---  --- The main feature of Communism has always been its anti-religious, and especially its anti-Christian, attitude.  The Teutonic Knights are portrayed as being surrounded by Crucifix-wielding monks. The reader gets no sense of the fact that the then-current Pope had repudiated the Teutonic Knights and condemned them for using missionary activity as a cover for naked German aggression.   ---  --- Alexander Nevsky is depicted as a Communist-by-anticipation. A scene shows him scoffing at "The people with money". It is implied that these people were unwilling to support the defense of Russia against her mortal enemies. ---  --- The barbarity of the Germans is shown unambiguously. They are shown throwing live Russian children into the fire. The heavy armor of the Teutonic Knights, a primary cause of the ice of Lake Peipus breaking under them, seems to anticipate the heavy mechanization of the Wehrmacht in Operation Barbarossa seven centuries later. ---  --- Music is a prominent part of this film. Jubilant music celebrates the determination to win and the final victory. Morose music highlights the cruelties of war.  ---  --- The whole gamut of human emotions is shown. There is a scene in which wounded Russian soldiers cry out to their girlfriends or wives ("Anastasia!" "Natalia!"). There is also irony in this film. As a Russian soldier is stabbed in the neck by a German who the Russian had attempted to tie up, the mortally wounded Russian's last words are, "I knew that the armor was too short!" --- 
This is my favorite production of the ALICE books.  I love the sets, songs, and casting. It's also very British, which I think adds another great element to the mix. ---  --- However, skip this DVD edition.  I got it, excited to see ALICE'S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND in widescreen and, perhaps a better print than what's previously been available. ---  --- No such luck. ---  --- The DVD appears to be struck from the same crappy VHS version that's been out there for ages.  Faded colors. Pan-and-scan. In this age of DVD, quality like this is such a shame
For those who endeavor to perfect fine art digital printmaking, this is the book to read.  It is a "how to" and so much more.  The book covers paper, ink, techniques, hand coloring and the practical application and intereaction of all of these variables.  The book is cogently written and elegantly displayed.  It is a must for anyone's library who wishes to expand their horizons in the digital printing arena.  Ms. Airey is a master of her craft and it shows
I really wanted to love this fragrance...after all, it is quite expensive and I'd read rave reviews on many websites...but after one spritz I sold it to a friend of mine! My favorite perfumes are Beyond Paradise, Ralph Lauren Romance, Ralph Lauren Style, and DKNY Be Delicious. Light Blue, to me, smells overwhelmingly of musk. I wore it all day and I ended up feeling nauseous, with a bad headache. This must be one of those perfumes that works well on most everyone else except for me
I'll get to the point ... if you are looking to stay abreast of what's going on in popular music, including the Indie scene, the Americana world and the major elders still around, this is as far as you need to go. The quality of the writing, be it an in-depth article (many of which are excellent) or a short review (you can expect about 200 per issue) is consistently high. Furthermore, I have been introduced to many great bands that don't even show up in any domestic magazine's radar, although -ironically- many of these bands are American. So, if you can't believe that best it gets is Spin or, much worse, Rolling Stone (how did it ever got to the low point of having Jessica Simpson on the cover ... yikes!), you will be immensely rewarded by trying Uncut. Tip: you can get any single issue at B&N, Borders or Tower Records for the same amount, that way if you don't like it you won't have to mourn 100 bucks
I have been subscribing to Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine for many years.  I find it an excellent periodical.  The genres range from humor, cosies, hard-boiled detectives, to locked room puzzles, with an added dessert of a "Mystery Classic" at the end of every issue, some dating from the 19th century.   I especially enjoy the absence of gore. The stories are just the right length to satisfy your "mystery craving" before bedtime.  Another kudo:  the AHMM is notably hospitable to aspiring short story mystery authors
I have this exact same soft light green deluxe pillow. I bought the pillow when she was about 2 weeks old. And I have been wearing it almost all day long every day since. She is 11 weeks old today. She is so comfortable when nursing on this pillow. The cushion is made of firm foam. She falls asleep on the pillow while it is around my waist. Even when she's not nursing or napping, the pillow helps me to support her weight when I'm sitting or standing. It fits me very comfortably even though I'm plus size. ---  --- The only drawback is that I need to order an additional slipcover because it can only be hung to dry, although it is machine washable. I really love this fabric, but apparently, this fabric is not available to purchase separately as a slipcover, so I guess I'll try the oatmeal twill cover.
ANother hot release, top 5 in 2005 so far. No one even metions track 7 produced by one and only El-Producto and track 8 by belief. Hot cd recommend to those who don't listin to bull
Sure, this was heaped with loads and loads of popular acclaim by the critics, but the question you should be asking yourself is, will it appeal to the average person?  The simple answer here is a loud and resounding NO.  Here are the reasons:  1) Unless you're a well-bred blue blood who knows all about Edward II and loves Shakespeare, this is extremely hard to follow, not just because of the archaic olde English-speake, but also due to choppy production and editing which impedes the plot coherence. Result? If you're not lost you will soon will be, and worse yet, you won't care; 2) Don't be fooled by the lure of Annie Lennox-she is an itsy-bit of a bit player in the overall run of this "movie" and is, for all intents and purposes, inappropriately placed in the middle of it much like the effect of having an MTV commercial rammed in the middle of your programme; 3) Let's be clear about what you're getting for your 10-15 dollars:  It's not a movie at all, but an arty-pretentious stab at cheap play production with less cinematography than your average soap opera or home movie.  Further, the "period" is thematically juxtiposed with costumes of old and new, making one more likely to ponder whether their budget was short, not what cutty-edgy-trendy-theme-within-a-theme are they trying to promote.  Who knew such a tantillizing, heart-wrenching piece of history could be rendered so dull?
Love this item...second one I bought.  Purchased one for my Dodge Ram, then sold it, bought new Nissan Titan and wanted another receiver step, as I left the other one in the Ram I sold
I bought this for my brother, he loved it! I was worried that it is a little big, but apparently fisherman have a lot of stuff :-)He said it was just right
Maybe no one noticed but towards the end of the movie when the Russian President and Jack Ryan are talking to each other through the computer, repeat is spelled "reapeat".  On top of that, the acting was horrible...this movie didn't take itself seriously enough.  Ben Affleck sucked as much as he did in this movie as he did in Pearl Harbor
I truly enjoyed Northern Lights.  Ms. Roberts ways with words are so descriptive and it kept me going with the mystery and growing love between the two characters in this book.  I truly enjoy Nora Roberts, she is an excellent writer.  I cannot wait to read more of her newer writings as well as her older writings. 
As others have mentioned, the front window blanks out almost immediately, and even worse, it doesn't show your missed calls.  You have to open the phone.  Stupid design.  It does not have any exterior lights, such as my old Samsung, that showed when it was charging, when charge completed, when a voice mail was waiting, etc.  This phone needs to be opened to get any info.  Can't even see the time without opening phone. ---  --- While talking on phone it blacks out after about 1 minute.  I don't like that either.  It's also very hard to hear on it.  Especially if in car, with traffic noise.  No, I'm not driving, but I'm a passenger trying to use my phone.  Forget it. ---  --- Re the color that someone mentioned.  Cingular is a light pastel pink, TMobile is magenta (dark pink).  The one thing I like is that this phone is a quad band, and if you travel interationally, it will be great.  I just got the phone, so haven't used it interational yet.  Oh, it must TMobile to get international service.   ---  --- The phone has a camera, plus other tech features, but I don't use them.  I want my phone only to be a phone, no other gadgets. ---  --- I would never buy this phone again, and as soon as I'm eligible for an upgrade this phone is history.  I doubt I would get a  Motorola ever again, I'll stick to Samsung.
Bought this product to stream HD media from PC/USB Storage. All though advertised on the box and website  it does not play the HD media. I tried to play the media from all 3 available inputs (802.11(wireless), Ethernet, and USB HD) and several formats that are supported (avi,mpeg2,ts,mp4). The HD movies were choppy at best. Plays all other non HD videos without a problem. Divx videos as well(even though it doesn't say it plays them on the box). Worked well with 500GB USB Drive but not needed. Would not recommend because HD feature is useless. Dlink technical support said to take it back to the store. There technical support grade is D- .
Well it was an obvious path to musical collapse, she should have stopped at Tidal.  If I'd been dating her for the talent she showed on her first CD I would have broken up with her over this piece of haggis.  The course of the last three CD's drew a trendline right from stardom into a melodic pit.  The lyrics on Extraordinary Machine were not only not up to their namesake but worse than the melodies.  The number of great reviews on this site only go to prove once again the masses prefer pablum in lieu of something complex and cognitive. ---  --- Her original Cd with it's collection of diminished and augmented chords set to deep overlays of texturing, blended with truly poetic lyrics has been replaced with a distilled musical joke.  What on earth gave her the impetus to try to go 'artsy' by experimenting with music predating the second world war I'll never know.  It's obvious her angst is no longer producing art, rather it is being replaced with contrived resolution and the equivalent of a musical epitaph.   ---  --- Eat it up people, it's all about not having to think.  It's the kind of tripe that happens when someone is trying to hard to think of how to outdo their first brush stroke of genius and is confronted with musical block.  Judging by the news her father is ruining her life and creativity as so often is the case in todays less than feminine half of the culture.  
Worked fine for standard items. Did not handle Partnership issues completely. Would be good to have a preview of the finished return before printed (maybe this is possible, but I did not find this function). --- In general, an easy, straightforward program that gets the job done
How come all the fun is for Chubby Bunnies like WHOLE milk? Don't skimmy girls have more fun? Then what about SKIM milk? ---  --- Why not 128 fluid ounces of Tuscan WHOLE milk, instead of SKIM milk? To get the full benefits of milk's yummy yummy eternal goodness, I'll let these experts tell you why. ---  --- "Less is more." Mies van de Rohe. ---  --- "Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler." - Albert Einstein ---  --- "The absent are always in the wrong." - John Bull ---  --- "My illness is due to my doctor's insistence that I drink milk, a whitish fluid they force down helpless babies." - W.C. Fields ---  --- "Things are seldom what they seem, / Skim milk masquerades as cream." - William Gilbert ---  --- "Two percent black; that's like skim milk." - Own Smith
I was very surprised by the reviews below because I found this magazine absolutely wonderful!! The articles range from architecture, to renovated homes, to specific garden types to the average home owner. I found so many great ideas and inspiration in this magazine as well. The pictures are great and I find myself tearing things out every month! ---  --- Fantastic for anyone interested in design, art, or interior decorating
Some reviews have suggested that this is not the ideal first purchase for the un-inititiated.  I am writing to confirm that assertion.  I have read enough raving reviews about their subsequent releases to know that it really does get better from here, but what a disappointment this album was for me.  It sounds like what you would hear coming from the garage next door.  My advice to the kids would be to keep practing and please turn it down. ---  --- Jack's appreciation of the blues is admirable, but only realised on the song "I Fought Piranhas".  Tellingly, this is the final song on the album.  Otherwise the songs are forgettable and even annoying at times.
This is an emotionally charged, witty, and brilliantly told drama of four friends struggling to understand marriage, divorce, intamacy, and each other.  One of the best plays I've seen/read
Well, I felt a little silly paying about $20 (with shipping) for 2 pieces of plastic, 2 bra hooks, and some rubber bands.  However, the kit does work, and does allow you to pump hands free.  One word of caution - if you use Medela's Quick Clean steam bags to clean your pump parts, TAKE THE HANDS FREE PLASTIC SLEEVES OFF before throwing the bag in the microwave!  Otherwise, they warp and don't fit right
I bought this product to assist in recovery, but I tried to recover a program and it would not work. Does real well on a complete recovery but do not expect a partial. Works well on recovery of My stuff
As the weather has cooled for fall and winter, I needed socks for my baby. I initially bought little cotton socks found in baby stores and department stores and they just didn't hold up as well. I have also tried socks with grips on the bottom, but they were so thick my son just sweated in them. The Children's Place socks are not too thick and very durable. Also, the non-slip  feature on the bottom of the socks have been tried out on hardwood floors and were the only thing that kept my baby from slipping all over the floor when he walked. The other socks did not! I strongly recommend these socks for your child
Fresh tuna. Great price.  I would recommend this product
Why buy the upgrade when you can buy the full version? ---  --- Basically cause it was cheap. You will see, old version, new version, 10.4.6, 10,4,8 and so on. I just bought the old version and installed the latest update. Now I am up to date and for a lot less money which meant I could spend the extra cash on more software for my Mac. ---  --- As far as performance, No faster than Jaguar or Panther. The Benchmarks say faster but if you stare at the screen in any version, the 10 nano seconds you save are not noticable. ---  --- You will encounter drive issues at some point as this version appears to have issues more often. This seems to be due to the new journaling scheme but I cannot back this up. ---  --- If possible I recommend you erase the drive you are installing to. In the disk utility, select the erase tab, and then the security button, Select the zero out data option. Note: you cannot erase a drive but only a volume. ---  --- This will clear out any corrupt data and pinpoint any bad or damaged sectors. ---  --- The main reason I wanted this was for the widgets. They are a blessing. Calculator, thesarus, package tracking, and many more. Tiger only comes with about a dozen widgets but in the widget configuration button, you will see the more widgets option. You will be directed to hundreds of others widgets for immediate and FREE installation. ---  --- My favorite is the weather and radar widget as I work outdoors a lot. I am able to quickly see the latest radar and plan my week, all by press F12. No need to interupt what I am doing on the Mac as the widgets will pop up in my layout and my activities stay active. Click any area other than a widget and they hide away. ---  --- If you want to wait for a version of the OSX that allows you to write your own widgets without taking a programming course, wait for Leopard
My husband and I ordered one for all our family members for Christmas.  They all appreciated it, something people don't think to buy for themselves.  It's a good quality product, I would reccomend one for each car
Wow I thought THULE was THE company for this type of stuff.  Boy was I mad after a trip from NJ to SC.  The bag was mounted to my roofrack and was a little noisy (top be expected).  But when I got to SC and opened the bag....the horror!  The inside lining shredded and flaked off on everything!   There were also 2 holes along the to seam!  What a mess...and I couldn't use the bag on the way home....had to ship my stuff home!  I just wrote THULE....we'll see if they come thru for the customer  --- Sept. 12, 2005 THULE sent me a replacement, an Escape 2.  Great customer service....but does this mean the Escape is better?  Is the Quest inferior?  There was no coorespondence with the repalcement...I'll try it out this summer
Very convenient reading glasses. You could hang them on your neck when not using them, and not even notice they are there. They are very sturdy, and are flexible making them almost imposible to break. ---  --- Cons: Both sets I purchased I notice them to be on the narrow side. They sometimes can feel too tight to the side of your face.  --- The glasses are also not practicable to wear for a person with long hair, as the glasses would trap your hair against your face
This shirt is very cute, but you may want to order it in a larger size than what your child normally would wear. My child normally wears a 24 month. I ordered the size 2, and it's much tighter and shorter than her other tops
As a student studying mathematics, I find it very useul! Packed with 3200 terms and 200 illustrations, It's a great quick reference guide. I found things in this guide that I couldn't find in any other book or guide. Another thing about this reference guide is the lack of poor illustrations and examples. Some things this guide helped me with is PARABOLAS, ELLIPSES, HYPERBOLAS, GAMMA FUNTION, ZETA FUNCTION, FEIGENBAUM NUMBER, THE GREEK ALPHABET, and much more. I thank David Nelson and Penguin Books for such excellent work
This is my first experience with Sim City.  I've never played with the earlier versions.  Important Note:  The computer prompts you to type in the code that is in the white box in the lower left part of back of the CD case.  Well, I looked and looked, and it wasn't where the prompt said it would be.  After five minutes of thinking my eyes were playing tricks on me, I finally found the code.  It's on the back of the owners manual located inside the CD case.  You'll find it at the very top of that back cover of the manual, not in the lower left corner. ---  --- The tutorials are helpful, so if you're new to all of this I highly recommend you go through those first.  And if you feel you need to go through them again, you can reset the tutorials to start fresh all over. ---  --- I'll built a small city, and I've only had this game for a day, but I know I'm going to love it. --- 
I had this camera for 2 months. It was kept in a case and was very well taken care of. I would not even allow my husband to touch it. I was taking pictures and then one suddenly came out as a white screen. I took another and the same thing. I asked my husband what he thought was wrong. We took out our memory card and tried internal. Same thing again. He said maybe it was the LCD screen. We loaded the pictures in the computer and it was even worse. I contacted Kodak several times. They don't care about their customers. I have talked to several others in similar situations with similar results. We will try to get their attention with a lawsuit. If interested contact me [...
We got this for my daughter for Christmas and she just loves it. The music is a little loud but she highly enjoys it
I also found this item at Target for $39.99. If you buy it at amazon or ebay, your wasting your money
but if they don't send you the magazine, then there are no way that you can contact the publisher about it. --- I didn't get the magazine after about first four issues. --- First, I didn't notice that I wasn't receiving my issues, but after three months, I found out and tried to contact the publisher about it. --- They don't have e-mail to contact them, but only automated phone number. --- If you call there and waste about 5 minutes to reach section "I didn't get my last issue", then you get about $.60 refund.  --- No further explanation or guaranty my next issues. --- and I'm still not getting any issues.  --- If you go to ripoff website, you can find the publisher was registered as ripoff company
The Scarf arrived with several holes in it. My daughter was very dissappointed, crying and wondering why Santa sent this to her. We ordered well in advance before Christmas but the set arrived too late. We were never notified that there would be a delay in shipping. A few days before Christmas it arrived! It was too late to do anything. Amazon should improve the quality control of vendors before it allows them to list on their site.
I'm a fan of Three 6 Mafia, and I can say maybe they kinda got a little of Three 6's rap style in this album, but I dunno. ---  --- DJ Paul and Juicy J, the superproducers, they can never be beaten. I got all the Hypnotize Minds albums and they did invent crunk music. Many people haven't heard of them cuz besides Ridin' Spinners and Chickenhead they haven't been played on the radio very much except for their new track "Poppin' My Collar." ---  --- Crime Mob's alright. The beats are alright, but nothing compared to Three 6 Mafia. Some of them are some krunk songs, I can get hyped to a few of them. But other than that I dunno. The lyrics are rather simple, I'm an 18 year old white dude and I think I can put together some better bars than these dudes can. ---  --- But they do get some major play up here in Virginia. Stilletos and Knuck if you Buck haven't gotten some airtime. But there's only like 4 songs total that are worth hearing. I guess we'll see if they put out another album or not. I think if they had some other fellas from Georgia like T.I. or Jeezy or something they might get some more hype. Who knows, since Paul Wall's on every song now maybe he'll make a cameo. I guess we'll see. ---  --- Three 6 Mafia still the buckest and besides their new artist Chrome, who really is garbage, they are still the kings of crunk, not Lil' John
No, this gun isn't very powerful - but THAT'S THE POINT. This gun is perfect for a young kid to learn about guns.  Slow enough you can actually see the BB, accurate enough to hit a target routinely at around 20 to 25 feet
I got it on sale for $88.00 thinking it would be a great bargain at that price. I feel I was ripped off. The video quality is ghastly when given enough light, and absolutely unusable without. The same goes for the pictures. Even at highest quality - and a lot of image enhancements, the results are mediocre. The audio portion of the video had a very noticeable hum, which I was able to remove with my audio editing software. Otherwise, the audio recording and playback were "acceptable," at best. This device is useful only as an audio recorder/MP3 player, and is not really a bargain
'Zulu' opens on January 22nd, 1879 with a pacifist missionary Otto Witt (Jack Hawkins), and his blonde daughter Margareta (Ulla Jacobsson) attending a Zulu mass marriage ceremony...  ---  --- The impressive dancing and chanting takes on a different tone when the preacher discovers that Zulu forces have massacred hundreds of British troops at Iswandhlwana and are determined to destroy Rorke's Drift, an army outpost, in addition to being Witt's mission station...  ---  --- The shaken reverend arrives and explains the situation to the British officers, advising an immediate evacuation... To his horror, the officers decide to withstand and defend their ammunition dump with 139 Welch infantrymen, a mixture of committed soldiers and complaining malingerers... ---  --- The haughty arrogant Lt. Bromhead (Michael Caine) is in charge, but Lt. John Chard (Stanley Baker) of the Royal Engineers - on assignment to build a bridge - takes command actually by strict seniority... ---  --- The situation becomes dramatic by the fact that Chard has had no combat experience and, on a distinguished level, he is obviously not from an aristocratic background... But urgency obliges the two officers to set up the defense of the station, deploy their men tactically, and prepare for the attack...  ---  --- Then thousands of Zulus, armed with short spears and captured rifles, arrive on the grassy hilltops... Their unseen advance is announced by a threatening chanting... ---  --- And then they come into sight...  ---  --- Long lines of black figures descending the green slopes of the hills, promising with the terrible clash of their shields and spears that soon they are going launch a fearless attack...  ---  --- Their techniques of tribal warfare fashioned an efficient and terrifying fighting force... They begin to test the British firing power with the life of their warriors...  ---  --- The British rifles cut them down and they retreat... But they come again-and again and again-each time getting closer to the station, cutting down the distance...  ---  --- Every withdraw is followed by a deathly silence... It seems obviously that any of them will survive... In every disciplined attack they are less in number and ammunition...  ---  --- After a long night, and at the rise of the sun, the fearful noise suddenly alerts the redcoats to another charge...  ---  --- Most of the men in the infirmary were too sick or injured to help... Few are malingerers, like Private Hook (James Booth), who decides much later to take his bayonet and fights heroically in hand-to-hand combat with dozen of black warriors inside the burning building... ---  --- Outside, the exhausted soldiers prepare for what must be the last charge, but instead they hear a massed yell from the Zulus--a salute of acknowledgment to the braves as they withdraw from the scene... ---  --- The battle at Rorke's Drift was a decisive one in the British campaign to pacify South Africa for European settlers who came to force their culture upon the angry natives... As a page in British history it has the distinction of being the battle which produced the Victoria Crosses in few hours - to eleven defenders for their extreme courage - an all-time record for one military engagement... ---  --- Stanley Baker is solid as the engineer who is forced to become a combat commanding officer; Michael Caine splendid (in his first major role) as the pompous aristocrat; James Booth good enough as the guy who can easily find a reason to check himself into the hospital; Patrick Magee excellent as the calm surgeon; and Nigel Green, a sergeant of the old order, sternly watchful and understanding of his men but compassionate, as in the last move when he lines the tired and dispirited survivors up for a head count... He looks at them and quietly advises: 'Keep your voices down!'  ---  --- The film is a superb account of that bloody engagement, and the fighting is shown in realistic detail... It salutes the heroism of the Zulus and the extreme courage of the redcoats...  ---  --- Cy Endfield's direction gives emphasis to the physical exhaustion of nonstop killing, and the effect it has on men, making some tremble with great fear... More significantly, he avoids any explanation about the racial nature of the conflict, keeping out politics and history...  ---  --- With John Barry's menacing musical score, "Zulu" was filmed in Natal, South Africa and Stephen Dade captured the luscious colorful landscapes and the sense of strange isolation... But the most arresting moment in the film is when Enfield's camera pans over a field carpeted with black corpses, gathered side by side or one on top of the other...  --- 
About a year ago I got one of these to allow me to play DVDs for my kids on my laptop while travelling.  It has an alarm that sounds when your battery is getting too low -- well it sounded immediately .  I figured that my car battery was not fully charged or on its last legs.  I hadn't tried to use it since.  Now that I'm taking another trip, I thought I'd try it out in other cars.  No luck.  The thing is dead -- doesn't do a thing when I plug it in
I love this soup.  It is healthy, vegetarian, and low calore.  For a light meal, I eat it alone.  When I want something more substantial, I mix in leftovers and a dash of hot sauce.  The microwave bowls make a good portion size.  It is really convenient to have it delivered in bulk to my door
...yes, the Beatles by which I'm not comparing Supergrass to them. No, Supergrass are riding the road built by not only The Beatles, but other British rock'n'roll greats like The Kinks, David Bowie, The Zombies and many others. But the exploding energy of Supergrass delivers a deeply satisfying listen that does not exist as frequently in the present 2000's. This will definitely be a group that will represent the virtouso side of British rock'n'roll of the 1990's and 2000's, and without doubt represent the Bohemia-Intellectual-Hard Rocking spark that has lighten recent generations that has been going on since Circa-Sgt. Pepper. An intoxicating and highly addictive album. 100% recommended for anyone any age.
I picked this up for my twelve year old son.  He is a beginner and has been glued to his electric guitar and eMedia Rock Guitar Method for the last two weeks.  The program is a great starter, just in case the kids don't stick with it.   It's better than $45 bucks an hour once a week, for now, at least.     ---  --- Great Product!  I reccomend it
I love this watch, and I love the price. It looks good both casual and dressy. It goes with just about anything. The people at Invicta are really right in that you should try to match your watch with your belt and such. ---  --- The material is high quality. I have large wrists, so it's tricky to get on and off initially because the leather is quite stiff. But it's been loosening and so it's much easier now
      This book, "The Relatives Came" by Cynthia Rylant and illustrated by Stephen Gammell, was a delight to read. I found myself smiling as I read the words that made the artwork come alive. Likewise, I found myself recollecting over the memories of the past when my relatives would come to visit. And, I felt as if I, too, were a part of this book. Having experienced growing up in a small town where you don`t see that many people, I believe that when relatives come to visit, it almost seems like Christmas. As a result, when the book expressed the joy, laughter, and celebration of family, it stirred up these memories of the past. Unquestionably, almost anyone, from children to adults, could find themselves reminiscing and longing for the fun they had when their relatives come to visit.
A commentary on a book of the Bible will generally include the commentator's outline of the structure of that book.  A good outline can greatly enhance one's understanding of a biblical book, so such outlines are important.  Rarely, though, do commentators say much about how their outlines are derived.         ---  --- This book, which is based on Professor Lee's doctoral dissertation, describes and illustrates a method for outlining the structure of a large section of biblical text.  This method, called "conceptual analysis", is a modern version of form criticism developed by Lee's advisor, Rolf Knierim. ---  --- Lee describes conceptual analysis as an iterative process, where one begins by dividing a text into smaller units with coherent themes.  One then takes a deeper look to determine how the units fit together into an overall structure for the text.  Finally, the outline is critically evaluated and the steps repeated as needed.  ---  --- Lee demonstrates the method on Num. 10:11-36:13, a challenging section of text that has been outlined in several different ways. --- He divides this section into 36 units, discussing with each one the rationale for his choices.  He then argues persuasively that the key unit for the organization of the section is Num. 13:1-14:45, the account of the exploration of the Promised Land by 12 scouts, the largely negative report the scouts present to the people, and Israel's subsequent rejection of God's plan to bring them into the Promised Land.  The pivotal events in this unit largely determine the form and content of the rest of the section. ---  --- Conceptual analysis is an attempt to make the outlining of a text into a "scientific" process, with the goal of deriving a structure from a text rather than imposing a structure upon a text.  There is no way to completely mechanize such a process, however.  Some subjectivity is inevitable, and any outline will highlight some features of a text and deemphasize others. ---  --- In my opinion, one good measure of the value of an outline is the amount of fruit it yields in insight into the text.  By this criterion, I believe that Lee's outline of Num. 10:11-36:13 earns high marks.  His outline helps give satisfying answers to a number of questions about the text, as he explains in the latter stages of the book.       ---  --- It is rare that a dissertation on form critical issues would be interesting to more than a handful of specialists.  This book is a notable exception, and I enthusiastically recommend it to all serious students of the book of Numbers.
I used these pads when I first started nursing.  They did a good job of keeping me from leaking onto my clothes.  However, my nipples were incredibly sore.  When I took my baby to her first appt., the pediatrician suggested cloth pads.  WHAT A DIFFERENCE!  Yes, they did cause me to leak through a little, but that was needed.  WHen ALL the moisture from let down is pooled up against your breast it causes sore nipples for some moms.  Don't use these.  Buy some cloth ones instead that will allow your nipples to breath (I use the Imse Vimse)
This software only got one star because I couldnt give it a zero.  It never worked on my Windows XP computer.  I couldnt open the program, couldnt close it, couldnt get the sytem to shut down.  After a hard shutdown, Windows would not start.  Tech support couldnt figure out the problem.  I uninstalled Panda, reinstalled Norton and system is working fine.  I would not recommend
All I have to say is 485 comics for 40 dollars.  Or about 40 years worth.  That's like a dollar a year.  You do the math...it's an amazing deal.  Also, quality is great and you can print them if you want
I bought this for my 6 year old after Christmas as her cousin received one and loved it.  I ran all over town trying to find the PVD's (which are hard to find a good selection of).  I ended up purchasing some online.  By the time the PVD's arrived, the player was no longer working.  We have replaced the batteries several times.  On a rare occasion, it will turn on, but that is very rare.  We are very disappointed with this unit.  I should have listened to my husband and bought the DVD player! 
This univeral DVD player comes packed very neatly in an Oppo cloth case and is very sleek.  The finish of the DVD player is excellent, however the remote is not up to snuff in this department.  This player can play PAL DVDs, it upconverts it to NTSC & 1080i.  It's loaded with features that you probably won't see on most DVD players out there.  The upconversion works well though I'm not sure the color handling is the best.  The audio controls in the setup are awesome.  People have complained about the disc tray being flimsy/cheap, but I think it's just fine.  It's very quick to load and play.  You may want to keep the remote safely because if you lose or damage it you won't be able to control most of the features.  The HDMI cable that is included with the player is of good quality.  Probably worth around fifty bucks in the market.  Price to performance/features you can't beat this universal DVD player.  Buy one and you'll know
 --- I should first state that I am a huge EJ fan. His music has been extremely important to me over the years. He is, without a doubt, a genius ... I would go so far as to call him the Mozart of our times. ---  --- But, Elton can also write bloated, self-indulgent tripe, and if you ask me, this album belongs in that bucket. I give it 2 stars just because of SSMLT, one of his all-time greats. I never cease to be blown away by that song. But the rest of this album? Booooooring!!!
We use these in all of our humidifiers and they do a great job
The amazon ad said next day shipping. Took over a month for the first magazine to arrive. --- DO NOT BUY THIS FROM AMAZO
it does look and certainly have a feeling of cheapness...but that aside, it works well, right on the money. easy to use, bright colors easy to find. the price is about right, no real bargain at less than 6 each. but nice as a stuffer to get the price to free shipping terms. i have 2 different models and feel the same toward each. no regrets
I have this program on a 30-day demo.  It might be OK if I didn't mind my computer becoming almost unusable. ---  --- I tried to run the system virus scan, as recommended, but after 3 hours it was only 2% done because it was stuck on a file it couldn't seem to get past.  I skipped the file, but then it quickly got stuck again.  The "time remaining" said it would take 4 days to complete, so I cancelled that scan. ---  --- It has a learning mode that initally blocks EVERYTHING.  Apparently, this program has no brain.  For example, I have the Live Search Toolbar installed in Outlook.  It had to ask me if it was OK to run that dll file.  In fact, each program that called up a process from a shared dll has to ask permission before it could run. ---  --- Don't even get me started on the Quickbooks and Internet Explorer problems.  Which is what it wouldn't let those programs do, even after they had been run and I repeated clicked "allow" over and over. ---  --- Twice today it got so slow running IE that it finally crashed the computer so bad that  I had to do a hard re-boot.  If you have it checking ports on your computer, almost nothing would run or download on IE. ---  --- So, I'm going to demo a few more, but it's probably back to Windows Live OneCare, which I had the past year.  It just doesn't seem to do much (no long list of features), but it also doesn't jam everthing else up
This device works "OK".  Jet stream is moderate.  Noise is considerable.  Has a lot of attachments that really don't do much.  I'm not sure what the brushes even do.  The dual tank function is pretty good.  But lack of pressure and too much noise outweigh the good part
I brought a few bags to a work day in May, and people are still asking me about them, because you can't buy them in stores around here. They're a cross between the soy version of rice cakes and potato chips, but people eat them by the handful like potato chips. But instead of making you sluggish like a bag of chips, the soy protein gives you energy
Oprah is an inspiring role model for millions of people. I believe that her mission is well-known- to help people live their best possible lives. It's rare to find another person who so consistently sticks to their "mission" and really change lives talk show after talk show, and magazine issue after magazine issue. If you want to make your life better, live more passionately and meaningfully then The Oprah Magazine will definitely help you out. It contains many interesting, inspiriting and balanced topics on a broad range of subjects written by excellent writers and contributors.  ---  --- I am glad that the magazine still contains many really readable and informative articles appropriate for every woman who wants to feel happy, empowered, informed and intelligent. I enjoy this magazine because it opens my mind to the world and celebrates life and womanhood. Each issue has a theme such as love, health, home, fitness, etc. and will cause you to take a serious look at your life and see how you can further improve yourself. You will find interesting and up-to-date information about fashion, movie stars, book recommendations, delicious recipes, money, relationships and friends. My favorite section is her quotes on bookmarks. ---  --- Oprah Winfrey is an example of a modern, smart and sensitive woman who consistently uses her talents and staff of editors to bring us the talk show and this wonderful magazine. I think that your greatest benefit will be to gradually realize and energize her main message-You should be the first priority in your life, because if you are confused, exhausted, dissatisfied, depressed then you will not be able to help anyone! The magazine covers all of these important areas and I am pleased to recommend it. Following Oprah's tradition to draw attention to books of great value I recently read and highly recommend to my male and female clients scientist Ritz' bestseller "Scientifcally guaranteed male multiple orgasms and ultimate sex" because it truly delivers great value and results. I dare say that this magazine and book will dramatically change your life for better
I am very please with my purchase.  It is nicely constructed and a beautiful purple color
It is really great!!!  Sure, it does hurt, but not any more than waxing.  I do not shave because I get cut very easily.  This is a great alternative to expensive waxing.  Even when I have more hair it works.  I would buy this product again, and again
If it were possible I would rate this item at no stars, completely undependable. Requires constant recalibration lasting for all of a few minures. Have tried all the suggested remedies, including new batteries, nothing works. Next stop is the recycling center
I ordered this for Christmas from a Marketplace Seller. It was defective and assumed I would have to deal directly with Philips to get a replacement. After seven weeks, I still do not have a replacement from them; their customer service people keep telling me 10-15 days, and I have no recourse. I also thought the unit was complicated to use and would gladly obtain a refund if I could, or even get the unit. I would not recommend buying this or any other Philips product to anyone. Their customer service is the worst I've ever dealt with. I also had to pay the shipping to return their defective DVD player
This cd should not have been released because it adds really nothing to this Jarrett quartet's other three releases.  It's like taking a fat paint brush full of cheap house paint and making a greasy mess of what WAS a very beautiful triptych.  "Belonging," "My Song," and "Nude Ants" are all virtuoso, spiritually empowered performances and should by all means be purchased and enjoyed.  But, I'd go nada on this one if I were you. ---  --- I was sitting with my 88-year-old mother listening to the last track and complaining about how lame it was and she said it was "hum-drum."  And she's 88, likes Lawrence Welk and it was past her bedtime.  (It's past "Late Night Willie's" bedtime too, I hate to tell you.) Heck, I've heard high school jazz bands cook twice as hot as this "Keith and the Somnambulists" incarnation.  Garbarek sounds like he's going to give himself a hernia trying to get out the altissimos.  I can't think of one interesting drum riff in the whole 61 minutes plus.  (Neither can Christensen.)  Les Scandinavianes sound like they need about 10 hours sleep and then, maybe, they start thinking about picking up musical instruments.  Jarrett is as wired as ever, but even he can't keep up with some of the tempos and the overall mood is disoriented, forced and cumbersome.  How any reviewer can say that this release captures the quartet's tight integration, displayed amazingly well elsewhere, is beyond me.       ---  --- With the exception of "Innocence," none of the compositions are very good, either.  "Oasis" has an interesting, if dire, melody line, but it can't summon the required ambience because of all of the clutter and dog poop around it.   ---  --- Unlike the other three releases mentioned above, this one has very little magnetism - the first track is all rambling rose jazz, where none of the musicians are feeding off each other.  I don't enjoy this kind of jazz, so cliched and unintegrated.  It contains that Jarrettian need to rush things and gang jump the tempo with heavy-handed neurosis peddled as jazz fusion. You feel like some nut in a BMW is suddenly sitting 10 inches off your bumper, too demented to use the passing lane. (Yes, I know Keith has mastered his scales and likes to crack knuckles with tempos and, yes, I now have a headache.)  There is an interesting part at the end, however, where Garbarek cuts way back on the throttle and swaggers around in the lower and upper registers of his tenor sax in some nice ways.  But the transition is contrived at best and bears no organic relation to the first part.   ---  --- Only "Innocence" benefits from the fact that these guys are probably taking a red eye flight to New York soon.  It is a beautiful lullabye, arguably Jarrett's best composition.  True, the "Nude Ants" version is all you need really, but something happens on this version of the song that is very special.  Jarrett puts in one of his best, if not his best, jazz piano performances.  The composition is perfectly suited to his virtuosity and sensitivities and the somnambulists, who are still pulling a Code 9, can't screw it up even if they want to.  (There is a halo around Keith Jarrett's head I bet you.)  Garbarek (somnambulist #1) plays the melody with a lot of heart, but he screws up the tempo in a very brief, weak improvisation.  The man is tapped, knows it and decides it's time to end the song.  Palle Danielsson (somnambulist #2) misses a lot of notes (doubly bad on double bass) and goes off into an ill-conceived, top-heavy improvisation right at the beginning of the song. Like Garbarek, he knows enough to STOP and retreat, letting Jarrett take over.  I can't remember a dang thing about somnambulist #3 (Christensen).  But Jarrett's effort cannot be touched and he plays like a true wizard.  A week later at the Village Vangard ("Nude Ants"), they'll all be playing at this level.   ---  --- If anything, I'd like to see the PM version of "Innocence" included in a compilation of the best concert performances by this quartet rather than a whole release of this mediocre concert.  For the most part here, we get hum-drum mountains, where many of the great riffs from the releases mentioned above are handled like a shaky old butler serving up tea, with people getting burned and tablecloths getting ruined.     ---  --- In particular, Garbarek's performance on "Nude Ants" is far superior to this one and maybe the mean streets of Greenwich Village got his "Norwegian up."  Maybe they weren't so sure if they were going to make it back to the hotel alive - New York USED to be like this you know - and, well, it just might be your last gig.  On "Personal Mountains,"  it's all polite "thank yous" and Japanese clapping robotically.  Not a tinkling glass of booze in the whole schmooze.  Not even a bonze meditating for more.  But, that Manfred Eicher, such a card, I tell you.   ---    
Not as deep as MacWorld but worth the subscription due to the alternative perspective on software and hardware. Very fun to read with a unique style of writing. The reviews can rarely be spotty with lack of depth as the culprit in some cases. The majority, though, are on target. The best part of the magazine are the unique 3rd party hardware finds. Overall a great addition and enjoyable read
Just purchased the Weber Platinum B4 Grill,(should have bought that through Amazon too, thats another story), so i needed the cover to keep it nice. Bought it on a Saturday and arrived on a Wednesday. Very nice cover, very thick, almost rubber like vinyl cover. They have improved the cover since the last one i received from Weber. They have enlarged the opening in a way to allow the cover to easily fit over the grill, this is huge really, it used to be like wrestling alligators to get the cover over the grill now it almost falls over the grill and hangs there. Anyway in summation it is very thick, fits and installs really easily and looks great, absolute necessity for investment of a grill thats now over a thousand dollars
I know, who thinks of looking for anything special when replacing your wiper blades.  Get the cheapest ones from the auto parts store and forget about it, right?  Well, if you have to deal with even the smallest amount of ice or snow, these blades are incredible.  They wipe clean and smooth every time and never clog up with ice or snow.  They sit low and tight on your windshield and don't skip or chatter at highway (or higher) speeds.  While $20 bucks each may seem like a lot, consider your safety in bad weather and how effectively these blades clean your windshield, and you'll thank yourself every time.  Buy them through amazon as they're the best deal around.  Every auto parts store that had them wanted almost twice the price
Never had I been so unhappy with my makeup as I was when I was using Clinique. I used Stay Beige (which I lightly patted on my face on top of Clinique's superfit liquid makeup - I have oily skin and was told this would help reduce the shine) and the end result was that it just made me look ghostly. I also hated how Clinique's liquid foundation and powder didn't have matching shades, so that I had to settle for Honey in the liquid and Beige in the powder. As much as I went back to Macy's to try to convince them that these weren't my shades, they just wouldn't listen. Either they didn't have the time or the patience to help me pick a new shade, or they were convinced I was making a big deal out of nothing. Instead of sitting there and arguing with them (which I shouldn't have to do in the first place) I just switched to a different makeup line: Laura Mercier, which I am VERY happy with. ---  --- I've had many other friends who were unhappy with Clinique and switched over to a different makeup brand, as well. I'm not trying to knock the product. I'm just saying it wasn't for me or for many of the other people I know. I would definitely NOT recommend Clinique to anyone. I'd rather pay a little more and get better results rather than settle for a $20 product just because it's affordable.
I am thrilled to finally purchase Birkenstock at a price that is fair. Our local retail stores,mark them up, so ridiculously. Thank you, Amazon
Thi is HotImportToys at their finest. They are advertising this as a bullet(bb) proof mask for use in airsoft. That leads me to question why in the upper left corner it says "Not suitable for children under 3 years." Now, why would it say that? This mask is meant to be a toy, yet H.I.T is saying this will stop bb's. Don't they realize that by misleading people like this those people could be seriously injured, or even killed??? I think this really needs to be looked at by Amazon. This could seriously kill someone
I read this book with an open mind.  I am familiar with the tremendous criticism that has arisen from claims that survivors of child abuse may use their backgrounds to claim some sort of privileged status.  In a few cases, I think this criticism may be legitimate; in other cases, not.  So I was interested to see if there were perhaps legitimate reasons to criticize survivors of the Holocaust or their advocates in the Jewish community.   ---  --- (Note:  I am not equating child abuse and the Holocaust.  I am saying that when people speak up about terrible things, there is often a tendency to see them as whiners who are shirking their responsibilities.  All things do not have to be equally terrible to promote this societal reaction.) ---  --- I didn't find anything in this book to convince me of that.  What I found was to me an unconvincing and highly subjective summary of the Jewish reaction to the Holocaust, in which the author claims that it did not become a big deal until a long time after it was over, and that it was made into a big deal for illegitimate reasons, but this discussion is so subjective and brief that I was not persuaded to adopt his point of view.   ---  --- The bulk of the book consists of complaints that Jewish organizations unfairly extorted money from countries such as Switzerland.  The argument becomes fairly technical here and evaluating it is beyond me because I have never read the reports ("audits," etc.) to which the author refers.  But I think that focusing so narrowly on money misses the point.  I expected to see a general discussion of the ways in which the author alleges that an emphasis on the Holocaust caused some Jews to "play the victim card," and what I got was a very indepth discussion of several fights about money about which I have no way of determining the truth of the author's allegations. ---  --- To me it seems obvious that the Holocaust was a terrible atrocity with devastating consequences for the Jews, and many lives were destroyed or damaged as a result.  It seems reasonable to me that the Jewish community would insist that society recognize the destruction and damage, and to the extent that this book detracts from this, I think it is unfortunate
i like this lotion it is moisturizing/retexturing but sort of waxy hence the 4 stars but it is still good stuf
Promptly received two replacement batteries for our phones, for the price of one from the original vendor. They work great! They hold a charge, with normal use, for about two-three days, as did our original ones when we first purchased them. Would buy again, if needed
This is a great cot.  It is low profile, and made of strong materials.  I was worried about the wire legs, but they are very, very strong.  So strong that it takes some muscle to get them into their holes in the frame.  This might be a drawback for someone who is weak in the arms.  It folds up easy and is very portable.  Also, I have a smaller frame, and although this cot is perfect for me, a larger frame person might want to consider a wider version for comfort in the shoulder area.  You won't be disappointed in this one for the money
A great add-on for the Xacti HD1, but two minor problems I've found so far. 1. I can't use a circular polarizing filter with the wide angle lens as it cuts off the corners of a picture and; 2. flash photography won't work as the  pop-up flash becomes obscured by the barrel of the add-on lens
Jan. 21 Update:  I got the low-battery indication while using the gauge, and it turns out that the LR1130 batteries are alkaline, not lithium as both the product packaging and instructions say they are.  The batteries are indeed very easily replaced, and I'm replacing them with the silver oxide equivalent (SR1130W), as the original batteries apparently weren't the freshest (although they were Hitachi-Maxell).  I continue to like this gauge very much. ---  --- I think this is a great product at a great price (currently $35 total), and I just bought a 2nd one to lend so others can see for themselves (don't want to be without mine in case it doesn't come back). ---  --- Very simple to connect and take a reading, and when bleeding air the numbers drop with the drop in air pressure, so I can reach the exact pressure I want quickly.  The batteries are user replaceable, but they are lithium (LR1130) and are expected to last more than several years (the packaging suggests they will last the life of the gauge, as "permanent power").  The gauge can be zeroed (recalibrated) simply by turning it on without any air pressure in the hose, confirming that the display reads "0.0," and waiting until the display goes off (20 sec. when no pressure is present and 60 sec. when there is pressure present). ---  --- While the gauge display reads to a tenth of a pound, the actual stated accuracy in the instructions is plus or minus 1 percent plus 0.5 PSI, which suggests that the real accuracy is within about 0.2 to 0.8 pound, which is still better than any other gauge I've seen or used. ---  --- The instructions explain things well enough (they read as though they were translated into English, but still completely understandable), and the listed Web site for the actual manufacturer, Measurement Ltd., Inc. (in New Jersey), provides contact info. for user inquiries. ---  --- I like using this gauge (it's quick and easy), and that makes maintaining my tire pressure at the proper level simple to do consistently (along with a good portable air compressor, like the TyphoonMax TX-500, which I also really like). --- 
I think those who haven't been where Henri Nouwen was, and weren't introduced to this "book" then will have a difficult time truly appreciating its gravity. ---  --- Thank God for Henri Nouwen
i bought this hoping i would look good and get my face cleaned. no lie, this soap makes you look uglier than you really are. so unless you wanna smell a little weird and not look your best, dont buy this soap! im serious!
Despite many attempts and a complete reinstall of Windows XP, my XP machine refused to load Easy CD Creator 5 Platinum, rendering the progam disc and all update discs useless. ---  --- Probably if you already had the program running in a 98 environment and then upgraded to XP you could keep it running with patches and updates.  So take statements by resellers that they provide update discs with a grain of salt.  If you cannot install the primary program, the update disc is of no use. ---  --- The program is a good one but you have to run it on a 98 machine. --- 
I love this conditioner! It smells divine and it made my hair feel like silk! My hair is ash blonde and i noticed a very slight lift in colour. Regardless, I recommend this product highly, especially for dry, damged hair. I recommend this product in conjunction with "NEW! (Hair) Solid Shampoo Bar", also made by Lush Cosmetics
This product is terrible. The very essence of Su Doku is logic & reasoning. This product leaves everything to guesswork. I returned it, ate the postage, & was happy to be rid of it! I then downloaded shareware from the Palm Store to my Palm Pilot for $10. Couldn't be happier
A movie not geared for morons!  What a rare find.  There aren't many movies that can't be figured-out half way through.  This film is great; very clever.  Never saw the ending coming
I love the Olay Regenerist line! Moisturizes your skin and makes it smooth. You will see a big difference after the first use! I've been using this product for 2 years now and just recently started the serum and it's great.
I'm a big fan of Great Big Sea and I purchase everything they release. Apparently they were trying to give this CD the "feel" of a live, medium-size venue performance. Unlike their other live DC offerings, this one sounds like it was recorded with a micro-cassette tape in some fan's front pocket. It doesn't give justice to their usual great vocals and unique sound. Overall, I was pretty disappointed and I'd recommend their earlier offerings over this one.
I took my MP3 player into the store with me to check out earbuds. --- Eveyone I tried was terrible; so I ended up buying online. ---  --- I read all the reviews, especially Amazon reviews; because the people know what they are talking about. ---  --- I have bought 5 pair altogether for friends, and they love these buds too. ---  --- The music I listen to ranges from Tupac to Vivaldi, and everything in between. My MP3 player has 9 EQ settings; I keep it on new age most of the time.  --- The price is right, and the sound is the best.
The car seat protectors have worked well over the past several months I have owned them. They are a little too big and interfere with my kids trying to buckle their seatbelt. I own a minivan, so if your seats are fairly narrow compared to the seats of a minivan, I would consider a different brand. Good luck. ---  --- Ke
If you want a simple to use program to manage personal finances Quicken is for you. I have found it very useful for keeping track of my checking and savings accounts. You can also make automatic posts to your accounts. Which is nice feature if you use automatic online bill pay with your bank. The program makes charts, graphs and reports showing where your money is going and coming from. It also does a nice job showing you if where you are meeting your budget and where you are spending too much money. Quicken makes keeps track of loans easy. It calculates how much money is going to interest and principle. I have been having a hard time and have been unsuccessful at setting up the program to track my 403B account. Overall, I think Quicken is a good program and recommend it to anyone to anyone who does not have a similar product already
If you burn lots of calories in your activities, this high energy food could give you a lift.  There are 250 calories packed into this little 2.4 ounce bar, which is advertised to be at least 70% organic.  This bar is advertised to be for athletes first, and as a casual snack second.  If you are overweight and trying to drop pounds, you can skip this snack and move back to unbuttered popcorn. ---  --- When I opened this bar I noticed that it looks like compressed goop.  However, the compressed goop tastes pretty good.  The texture is much like a granola bar, though more moist than a granola bar.  The black cherry part of the black cherry almond is understated.  There are dried cherries in this mix rather than artificial cherry flavor, which is a big plus.  I was unable to find anything in this bar that implied it was artificial, which is an even bigger plus. ---  --- One thing that confused me a little is that the bar is advertised to have no wheat and no dairy, but the label on the bar states that there may be trace amounts of dairy.  I guess they either knew there might be a very small amount of dairy or they were hedging themselves because of possible cross-contamination from some other process.  In either case, vegens consider whether trace amounts of dairy makes this an acceptable product.  The label also states that there may be traces of peanuts. ---  --- This bar also contains 20% of the daily recommended dietary fiber, which means drinking lots of water is a good idea when eating this bar.  There are also lots of vitamins and trace elements, which may be a good thing unless you take vitamin supplements, in which case you may need to consider whether you are getting too much of a good thing. ---  --- Clif Bars could be a casual snack, but the ingredients and their marketing really suggest that they are geared toward individuals that are looking for a healthy energy boost in high energy activities.  If you fall into that category, which could include hiking, climbing, bicycling, running, jogging, and other similarly strenuous activities, then this bar could be a good way of packing a big punch in a small package. ---  --- Enjoy!
A little fatter than the regular battery which means a very tight squeeze in my Q-holder but the extra power makes a big difference
I don't think these Skechers are made out of leather, so I'm very disappointed.  I thought I was purchasing a quality shoe from a reputable manufacturer, but with such a low price it was "too good to be true"
This is one of the bibles for anyone in graphic design, advertising, illustration or photograhy. It digs deep into industry trends, features portfolios of upcoming industry stars, and is a must for anyone who takes their craft seriously. While the issues are great, their Regional Design Annual is the must-buy issue every year. It really lets you know who the cream of the crop are. Just flipping through it will make you better at what you do (and you'll even stop using hackneyed phrases like "cream of the crop")
I love this old Paul Newman movie. The plot is terrific.  The characters and all the family personalities are very realistic. The story taking place down south is refreshing. Paul Newman is very sexy. I highly recommend seeing this movie if you are a Paul Newman fan. 
Herf applies a very simplistic test to determine the Nazification of both Germanies: did they side with Israel in the Middle East version of the Cold War or did they not? The trial against Paul Merker in the East, which had as its background East Germany's reluctance to pay reparations to expropriated Jews, serves as his prime evidence for the continuation of things Nazi in the GDR. But both of these arguments completely ignore the Marxist ideology underlieing the rationale of the East German leadership and bypass more complicated issues of political allegiance. Moreover, they totally eclipse the East German cultural discourse on the Holocaust, a discourse that was decades ahead of discussions in the West and still proves to be more sophisticated than most that is being written in Western academia.
Bought this game at Books a Million in North Carolina for a mere $10+tax. A very good deal! Although I don't keep up on a lot of contemporary literature, I was able to do pretty well. Within three hours I had all but one pie. One of the teammates did as well. The third of us wasn't as lucky, but it was a fun game nonetheless. As with all board games, the fun is in the company, not knowing all the answers. The questions were good, and yes - tough - but they were tough for all of us, not slanted towards one particular audience.  ---  --- I would have given this 5 stars except that there really do need to be more question cards. But for $10, three adults had three hours of intelligent entertainment (we went through half of the cards). We got our money's worth
Not sure if they are needed, but a good replacement for the grills that come with the Grill.  Stay cleaner, do not rust, and work as advertised
Nice mic at a great price. However, it doesn't include a pop filter which is essential. I was shocked to find that these filters can cost as much as the mic
Very seldom do I give up on a book; I gave up on this one after several attempts to finish.  I have read Barbara Delinsky in the past and have enjoyed her books. I remember the fascination with the Peyton Place/Grace Metalious hoopla in the 50's and 60's so I was expecting to enjoy this story.  It is dull and tiresome.  
I am a latecomer to the works of Chopin, unqualified to comment on Dinu Lipatti's technique and interpretation, but this recording gives an interesting framework to explore the waltzes. They are numbered 1 through 14 in order of opus publication, but on this disc Lipatti shuffles them to form a cycle of his own devising. There are four waltzes in the key of A flat and it seems one challenge was to space them across the recital. Contrast this to Alexandre Thaurad's CD where he clumps like-key waltzes into groups. (He also adds five more posthumous works.) ---  --- Most of Chopin's waltzes start on the dominant, meaning either the fifth note of the home key (the tonic, the I), or a dominant seventh chord (V7) which leads to the tonic. Lipatti uses this feature to string together his cycle. If, for instance, there were a waltz that ended on a C natural it could easily bring us to Waltz No 4, which starts on an insistent C7 chord before rising to the home key of F major. I will use this as the starting point for tracing the harmonic relationships of the tracks on this CD. ---  --- Track 1: Waltz No 4 in F, "Grande Valse brillante" - as noted starts on the V7 and finishes on F in octaves. ---  --- Track 2: No 5 in A flat - begins on a trilling dominant Eb, but the note it trills up to is an F (which ended the previous track). Finishes with a parting shot, a turn in the bass ending on Ab. ---  --- Track 3: No 6 in D flat, "Minute Waltz" - starts on Ab; the contour of the opening phrase echoes the gesture of the previous parting shot as well. Ends in Db. ---  --- Track 4: No 9 in A flat - has two pick up notes then hits a Db on the downbeat of the first measure. The right hand ends on the Ab above middle C. ---  --- Track 5: No 7 in C sharp minor - starts on a G sharp above middle C, which is the same black key (enharmonic equivalent) of the previous Ab. Ends in C# minor. ---  --- Track 6: No 11 in G flat - starts with a pick-up turn then hits the downbeat with a Db (enharmonic C#). Ends on a Gb in the treble clef. ---  --- Track 7: No 10 in B minor - starts quietly on the same note, an F# (enharmonic Gb). Ends with a soft B in the bass clef. ---  --- Track 8: No 14 in E minor - first note is the exact same B in the bass. Ends in E minor. ---  --- Track 9: No 3 in A minor - starts on an E in the bass melody. Ends in A minor; keep in mind that minor third of this key is a C natural -- you can hear it in the melody of the third to last measure. ---  --- Track 10: No 8 in A flat - this is a side-stepping change of keys, but there is an harmonic link to the previous waltz. Instead of starting on the dominant, this one begins on the major third -- C natural. ---  --- Track 11: No 12 in F minor - starts on the dominant -- C again. Toggle back and forth between tracks 10 and 11 and you will hear that these two waltzes start on the exact same pitch. Instead of ending in F minor this waltz closes in the relative major of Ab. The last three notes are a rise and fall, Bb-C-Ab. ---  --- Track 12: No 13 in D flat - there is a leading note before the dominant. The first three notes (Bb-Ab-F) fall and rise in a mirroring gesture to the final phrase of the previous. Ends quietly in Db. ---  --- Track 13: No 1 in E flat, "Valse brillante" - another side-stepping key change but there is a connection. If you toggle between tracks 12 and 13 you will hear the same initial note, a Bb -- quietly in the former, boldly here. Finishes resoundingly in the tonic Eb. ---  --- Track 14: No 2 in A flat, "Grande Valse brillante" - introduction in the dominant chord, Eb7. Closes in Ab. From here you could loop around to the beginning of the cycle again, linking the major third (C natural) to the V7 that starts the F major waltz
I've been using a Mac for the last 10+ years and I had assumed that Windows had gotten better since Win 94.  Boy was I wrong.  It amazes me that the entire world runs on this awful excuse for an OS.
If you ever wondered what it would be like to wander in a field of violets, then this shampoo gives a lush interpretation of what it would be like to walk through one of Raymond Gehman's photographs.  ---  --- The deep purple color is remnicent of crushed blackberries and the scent is a mingling of lemon, coconut, Bergamot and violets. The truth is, this shampoo is one of the best shampoos Lush sells and I think it gives even more body and texture than Rehab. Use this and follow with the Coolaulin conditioner for shiny bouncy hair that is scented with violets and coconut.  ---  --- The fragrance follows you around for hours and envelops you in a comforting warmth. This shampoo may have you dreaming about the Purple Haze gift box filled with violet, lavender and blackcurrant items or looking into the "Gratuitous Violets" soap.  ---  --- To complete the experience, you may want the "Smitten" hand cream - quite luxurious and comforting. For some reason, the All That Jas bath item worked well with the violet scent so my house is now scented with Jasmine and Violets and I feel like I'm walking in fields of flowers.  ---  --- ~The Rebecca Review 
These balls are horrible, they don't bounce like regular balls, worse yet once they come up from the ground it does not come up straight, it goes to the sides most of the time
This one is a product of bad quality, the cap of the batteries to a few days I damage enough of light is needed in order that the sign meets slightly clear, product of bad quality I do not recommend it to him(you,them) and for quality the price must be low
Good subject, the workings of a devious female mind.  A complicated love triangle.  Superb acting
This is adorable. It's nice fabric and really creative, but a little difficult to put on my seat securely.
Very smooth transaction. Shipping was timely and product as good or better than advertised. Good supplier. Would recommend using based on my experience
My daughter was very excited to receive this for Christmas, until she tried to change the thread that came with the machine.  It literally would not work anymore.  I tried everything.  Maybe it's defective.....but from other reviews I read, I think it's just a really bad attempt at a great idea. Too bad....she is very disappointed....
Placed the order on 11/20, delivery was supposed to be by 12/9. On about 12/1 I contacted the company that Amazon said was the provider, Unbeatable Sale, Inc. to verify that they did have the order. Unbeatable said that it was an Amazon order, period, and gave me a number at Amazon to contact. Amazon said that Unbeatable had the bike on back order because they fill their direct orders first.  --- Cancelled the order and found a similar bike for 20 dollars less at Walmart.
Great new phone here. Advanced video captures, decent zoom and playback ability. Great for travel, with excellent sounding MP3 player integrated, Bluetooth ready, and big hard drive for tunes. Real good looking design as well. So far so good
This granola is delicious.  Being that it's gluten free is a bonus since it's so hard to find acceptable healthy foods within that diet.  But my family can eat whatever they want, and they couldn't stop eating it! The cranberries bring a wonderful touch of sweetness to the nuts and crunchies. This is a great treat to keep with you when you want a more substantial snack
ESTE PRODUCTO NO ES LO QUE ANUNCIAN,100 METROS DE ALCANCE Y SOLO PALABRAS NO SIRVE, NO LA DEBUELVO PORQUE ME SALE MAS CARO EL ENVIO DE LO QUE CUESTA ESTA PORQUERI
A year or so ago, I bought several of these on sale.  They are poorly sized (I have 4XT), far too tight for a big man like me to wear comfortably.  Maybe you could order several sizes too big to get a good fit, but unless you want everyone to see every roll of fat, I'd avoid buying these
I stumbled across this movie on cable a couple of years ago, having nothing better to do I watched it. My first impression was that it would be just another stoner movie were nothing really happens. I was suprised though because not only does it have a plot it has a interesting plot. You don't have to be stoned, or even a stoner to enjoy this movie. One reveiwer said somthing along the lines of it looking like grade school kids made it. Well it is true it was an independent film made on the cheep but think it actualy adds something to the over all feel of the film, like your actualy there, scrapping through life with the characters. I guess I can understand why some people wouldnt get this movie, not enough bells and whisels, but if your up for something differnt give it a try. by the way, the movie was based on a book of the same name, also very good and differnt
I'm a fan of Dave Barry, I enjoy his column, I enjoyed some of his books in the past, and I bought this one with great anticipation. Boy was I disappointed! The story is meaningless, the characters are not interesting, the events are mostly dumb and the dialog is uneven and unfunny. ---  --- Do yourself a favor, do not read this book! I can't believe anyone recommends it
My husband and I purchased this set with my first son, but are going to choose another bottle manufacturer for our second son.  The difficultly we experienced was securing the nipple ring onto the base - it had to be in perfect alignment or there were definately leaks, sometimes more than that.  It is quite frustrating when you are conducting late night feedings or traveling.  I hope a new second chose will brings easier bottle feedings
I am a big fan of the Missing Manual series. Previous books have given me lots of insights into my installed software and have made my computing time much more efficient. I therefore approached this book with much enthusiasm. Office is such a gargantuan program, with tons of bells and whistles, that Microsoft itself estimates that most users  take advantage of less than a third of its capabilities. ---  --- However, the book is a major disappointment, because of its many mistakes and poor organization. Most of the mistakes are ones you can work around--for example, on page 8 the topics covered by appendixes A and B are reversed--but the sheer number of such mistakes makes reading the book a major distraction. Every few pages I find myself going to the Missing Manuals web site to report yet more errata, such as incomplete or wrong instructions, figures that do not agree with the text or figure captions, incomprehensible writing, seeming confusion between the Mac and PC versions of the program, etc. And I agree wholeheartedly with a previous reviewer who complained about the inadequate index. ---  --- It looks as though O'Reilly Publishers did not do an adequate proofing of the book, but instead rushed it out as soon as possible. That is too bad, because I will now be much more hesitant to purchase another Missing Manuals title
My husband just loves this watch and can't get over the great quality for the price
These things are just plain disgusting. --- If you are ever in need of emegency rope, get these, but otherwise I doubt they are fit for human consumption. --- It feels and tastes like eating soft plastic, and I would hate to think what they do to your insides. --- I have battled to even give some of these away, so they ended up in the trash can, where they rightfully belong
This product serves its purpose, but does not need to cost almost $30!  Basically, it's a foam wedge with white mesh fabric over it. I'm sure you can find the same product that performs as well, if not better, if you take the time to look
DMX stars as the drug dealer King David, who pops up in the streets again after a long absence. Rolling into the frame in a player's classic - a late 70's Stutz Blackhawk - King David shrugs his way back into the hard-knock life. He quickly reaps what he sows and, mortally wounded, passes all his worldly goods to Paul (David Arquette), a scrambling white would-be writer. King David's estate includes an audio journal of his life, which provides flashbacks and a narrative-within-a-narrative that answers the shaken Paul's curiosity. It's the highlights of King David's high life that propel "Alone."  ---  --- Like all of Goines's heroes, King David is a scourge on the periphery, and the movie dramatizes his corrosive effect on the margins with savvy muscularity. Every life he touches he leaves in ruins - a need to deface beauty as a result of self-loathing is implicit, and DMX signals that motivation with sly hostility.  ---  --- To say that King David is the best part he's ever had is an understatement; he has never felt the need to inhabit a movie in this way before. ---  --- I would recomed this to anyone who likes the hip hop lifestyle or music and for anyone who like films with a twist
I tried this mascara expecting great things but was very disappointed.  The mascara seemed dry and it took too long to apply enough so that it even looked like I had lashes (my natural lashes are almost clear).  Back to the drawing board of looking for the Holy Grail of mascara
I purchased the light and medium resistance bands over a month ago and they are still going strong! I use them a couple times a week during my pilates workout and they work perfect.
I have spent many years walking the Earth, much like Kane, and I've seen many things. Some of them legal, some of them warranting several eternities in Hades. But I have never before bared witness to purple potatoes. Seeing as that I am such an adventurous chap, I decided to give them a whirl. If nothing else, I told myself, they would make delightful earrings for my wife, Maude. She's something of a tuber afficianado, don't ya know. Upon their arrival at my abode, I happened to notice that the delivery lad was wearing a bio-hazard suit and that the potatoes were being transported within a lead container. Thinking nothing of it, I opened the container and proceeded to eat them raw. Imagine the surprise and delight when I felt my very DNA being torn apart and restructured. I now write to you all from the cave I share with the cyclops, seeing as how I am now 37 feet tall, have a spiked tail, horns, and nictitating membranes over my eyes. Did I mention I am a lovely shade of violet now and breath fire? All thanks to the delicious pommes de terre
We used these bottles for three weeks, and we are very skeptical that they actually work as well as they are supposed to.  There are some additional drawbacks as well. --- 1)  These leak in travel.  Twice we've gone to the park with 7oz, and arrived with 4 and a mess in the bag. --- 2)  We see no difference in reducing gas. And while these are designed to take gas away from the collar on, what about all the air in the nipple where the air first enters?  Is this a gimmic? --- 3)  The flow is too fast.  We went from bottles with smaller holes and less flow to these, which are far too fast for an infant
One of the warmest, most pleasantly lip-smacking film's ever! --- Made by a guy with a super-sized heart, AMERICA is a joyous --- celebration of the burger, and the down-home folks who create --- some of the most wonderfully odd versions of it. Take it from  --- someone who has the HAMBURGER AMERICA poster hanging up - this --- little treasure is a home library essential
A Man Escaped is one of those films that improves with repeat viewings. Bresson makes a strange choice in omitting the opening chapter of the memoir the film is based on which deals with the hero's curiously distant emotional response to killing a collaborator, which does throw some light on the sudden apathy and inertia that paralyses him once he is on the brink of making his much-delayed escape, but in other respects it's a perfectly contained and executed movie.  ---  --- The performances are very strong (Bresson was still aiming for naturalistic performances at this time) and the Christian allegory - that we want redemption but instinctively back away from it - is not overstrained: although this time round I noticed a few more references to religion than I recalled, it's there if you want to see it but never at the cost of turning the movie into a sermon. ---  --- New Yorker's source material is not especially good, but considering how bad most 35mm prints that go round the revival circuit are, it may well be a case of making the best of what material was available to them
This seems to work well but sometimes, it doesn't seem to read right.   I am a beginner - so take this with a grain of salt
jewish soles trying to avoid the devil's brigade (hitler's killing machine).... sad, but oh so funny and cute in sections that alas, maybe only the jewish people would truly understand. i found it all of these things but with love, warmth to the end
I purchased a copy of this album after a suggestion from a friend.....a few hours later in ended up in the bin.....very dissapointing, bland and not to mention boring and derivative (some people from New York would understand what I mean).  In summary....not only does kylie mingogue (I wont grace her name with capitals) fall flat on cd....she also cannot perform live and rely's on "gay camp it up" imagery to hide behind (a very cheap and politically incorrect exploit).  A very bad performer and a shameful album. 
I'm a huge fan of the Pria line, but these are not like the others - they are heavier and a little grainy.  I don't hate them, but will not buy them again.  The flavor is pretty good though, just not what I was expecting.  I highly recommend the Pria 110 calorie line - the vanilla is my favorite but the peanut butter and others are close behind. --- Thank
the product seems like a great idea, however, it did not come with attatchments for an i-pod, which is the reason we bought it.  Called the company to get the adapter and now need the mfg part number.  it has just been a hassle
If Shakespeare could come back to life and see what they made with his play "Othello", he would remove Heaven and Earth crying out for justice. Be an actor in a play of Shakespeare it's difficult and only the best ones can do it, not mediocre actors with face of children. What's Martin Sheen doing here? He should be in better movies and in this trash, if you want a good "Othello" adaptation, get the movie with Kenneth Brannag and Laurence Fishburne, are good actors and a better movie
The author is an owner and operator of a tutoring center. He is not an expert in auto mechanics.  As he points out on the back cover the pictures and the concepts were for teenage boys and the accompanying graphics are of poor quality. ---  --- If you actually want to learn anything substative of autos this is a poor poor choice. You are better of visiting the automotive section of www.howstuffworks.com or some similar website to learn more with better graphics and for free. ---  --- I bought this book long time ago and finally had the time to look at it and I regret it
There is an interesting comparison to be made between Ingmar Bergman's classic "The Virgin Spring" and the grisly exploitation shocker it inspired, "Last House on the Left" by Wes Craven.  They share identical plots, feature graphic rape scenes, and before it's all over turn average men into murderers.  And yet one is considered to be a bona fide classic and 1961's Oscar-winning Best Foreign Film--and the other appreciated only in underground circles, but largely reviled as cheap gruesome exploitation. ---  --- So just how different are they?  Not as different as you might imagine--but as different as art and exploitation. ---  --- "The Virgin Spring" is easily one of Bergman's most accessible films.  Telling a simple story in a straightforward fashion, he exposes a frankness and brutality people weren't accustomed to seeing.  A young girl venturing through the woods encounters two men and a boy.  Though they initially seem helpful, their actions quickly become violent.  After a graphic (for the time) rape, the girl is murdered.  Later, the wrongdoers happen upon the girl's home and seek shelter from her family--both groups unaware of who the other is.  Suspicions start to arise and vengeance is sought. ---  --- It is a powerful tale of love, loss and the depths people can be driven into--where they become unable to stop themselves from betraying their faith and moral code, where savagery and rage take over.  Bergman's film benefits greatly from a stellar lead performance by Max von Sydow as the father.  Real conflict and raw emotion burn up the screen.  Add the beautiful cinematography and haunting score and it's a winning combination.  But what endures in the story of "The Virgin Spring" is how strong a component faith becomes--when there is nothing left to believe in, can you still believe?  A classic in every sense, "The Virgin Spring" still has the power to shock but there's something very redemptive about the film. ---  --- "Last House on the Left," however, is probably more notorious than acclaimed.  The plot, as I've said, is identical.  Coming 12 years later, in 1972, Wes Craven was at the beginning of his career and sought to retell this tale.  It is a shocker, and the scenes of rape and murder clearly foreshadow the "torture cinema" of today.  It is brutal, uncompromising and graphic--and the film was championed in the underground horror market. ---  --- Working with a small budget, the film lacks the artistry of "The Virgin Spring."  While it still packs a visceral punch and has the power to shock--what it lacks is depth and subtlety.  The characters aren't particularly drawn out so their actions don't have the emotional resonance of the earlier film.  Without contemplating faith and moral choices, what we're left with is straightforward revenge.  And the film, ultimately, has no redemption--no uplift.  It's violence for the sake of violence.  It remains a historically significant precursor and influence on other shock films without being a particularly good movie in it's own right.    ---  --- And therein lies the difference between art and exploitation.

Having just gone back to using a film camera from digital (my wife still uses digital) I have found this to be an excellant camera so far. I have taken 6 rolls of film and everyone one has came out perfect. I would recommend it
I received this chair very quickly, even though it was close to Christmas. The chair was wonderful! Such a great price for such a great chair
My three children are huge fans of Melissa and Doug puzzles and with as many as we own we sure needed a way to store them neatly.  Being an organization freak myself, I was in search of the perfect storage case.  Not only did it need to hold many puzzles, but it needed to be made well and look nice too.  Melissa and Doug to the rescue - once again!  We purchased the same storage case in natural and it's been a life saver in our toy room - it makes it easy for them to put the puzzles away without them losing pieces anymore.  You might find it hard to spend $30 on an empty storage case so I suggest looking for the storage case that comes with six puzzles for $60 instead.  More for your money!  In our case, we own so many puzzles that we didn't need anymore and especially duplicates of what we already have
Frontpage 2003 is a great, easy-to-use WYSIWYG web builder.  Most hosting companies support Frontpage extensions, a set of web robots to help you build a dynamic site, similar to DHTML. ---  --- Two warnings, though: ---  --- 1) This full version is too expensive; you may qualify to buy the half-priced Academic Version (search for "frontpage 2003 academic" on Amazon); ---  --- 2) More important, though, Frontpage is being discontinued as a product altogether and will be replaced by Office SharePoint Designer (for businesses) and Expression Web (for everyone else).  You can download the latter for free (for now, at least) on MSFT's website
Quite frankly this is the only cooking magazine I have ever subscribed to that I actually have looked forward to using and to receiving every two months. I like it so much I am writing my first Amazon review! The format of the magazine makes it easy to follow the recipes - they are always printed on two pages across from each other - and unlike some of the other posters I prefer the black and white format so that the paper is thicker and doesn't tear easily. Having tear away ads (for their own products) on the outside of the magazine means that the usable portion doesn't take up much space on my shelf.  ---  --- The recipes are easy to follow and usually clear. When they include specialized ingredients there is usually also a substitution listed. Their product reviews are terrific - I wish I hadn't wasted so many dinners on bad whole wheat pasta. My only gripe, as someone who does not have a dishwasher, is the great number of bowls and kitchen tools the recipes require. ---  --- I have made at least half the recipes from the magazines, many several times, which is no small feat for a "flexitarian" who never has meat as a main dish.
These teas (both the raspberry and the blueberry) are priced lower than in the grocery store ($3.49 per individual box), where they are usually a seasonal item. This is frustrating since my husband and I are hooked on them and probably brew and drink a full pitcher per day.  They are the best tasting cold ice teas and great for the antioxidant benefits.  This seller shipped them promptly and they were very well packed.  We will be a repeat buyer for sure.  A+!!!!!!!!!!!
First, I received this subscription as a gift for the holidays and can say that it is the gift that just gives, and gives, and gives.  This magazine has been a wonderful source of ideas for in the kitchen, on the grill, around the house, in my garden, in the state as well as all through the south for traveling.  Being a woman who moved from the Detroit suburbs to Florida so I could be with ailing family, I was really a duck out of my elements.   ---  --- I had no idea of what was where within the state; what are good places to visit, where are some of the great attractions outside of Orlando, the Keys, and the Everglades and who does what where.    In this magazine, there are sections devoted just to Florida (which I suspect they do for each state per subscription) -- what to plant when, what festivals are going on, what's hot and what's not - a whole derth of information devoted just to the state I live in. ---  --- And that's not all... ---  --- Not only do I get to learn more about where I am today, I can explore and learn about where I'd like to go tomorrow.  One month, it's "Welcome to Alabama" and all the wonderful gems it has to offer.  Another month, I am poring over beautiful Georgia.  A different topic?  Seafood of the South.  How would you like to learn about fantasic, but yet unknown, places for bargains and great finds?   ---  --- Now - I am also an avid cook at home - and I cannot tell you how much I love to read through and try/improvise on all the de-lish recipes found each month closer to the back of the magazine.  How many differnt ways have I learned to make potato salad alone is worth the cost of admission!  I have learned so much more about grilling, vegetable side dishes, breakfast treats and savories from all over the south, tempting, lip-smacking desserts - and everything in between.  I have always known the south was the jewel of the States when it came to cooking - but W.O.W!  So much history and fun can be shared whether it be in the kitchen or on the grill.  And it is a great compliment to what I learn from other books, the Food channel, and beyond.  It speaks to where I live, what I can get down here, and what the heck plantains are anyway :-) ---  --- I love looking through many of the decorating ideas, the travel tips, and vignettes of different states, or towns, or themes.  The only reason this magazine does not get a 5 from me is that it sometimes caters/addresses a crowd which can afford more than I can in the way of travel, decorating, etc.  I am more simple, down-to-earth folk, and do not share much with "decorating your summer cottage", or what to do with that spare $ thousand plus dollars on a cruise, or splurge excursion.  Sometimes, and since they are not making this magazine specifically for me I am not going to be able to relate to EVERYTHING, I am not the crowd they are talking to.   ---  --- Otherwise, this magazine is a 10 in my book  :-)  Well worth the money - but even more so - the anticipation of next month's "explorations"
I use the IR interface with the Polar s625x running computer, and I have never encountered a single problem. I usually use the interface in to different computers, a notebook at home (with XP), and a desktop at work (2000), and in both computers it works nicely. ---  --- You have to be careful and follow the directions that come with the IR interface. Install the software and drivers before you connect the device to the computer.  ---  --- I love my Polar watch, and the IR interface is an excellent complement for an excellent product. --- 
Just as a note to any Motorola i530 users, this belt clip does not fit the phone.  The wraparound clips at the bottom of the holster are too large for the phone and the thumbclip at the top of the holster does not reach far enough over the top of the phone to snap into the lock groove.  Do not bother with it.  This item may be mislabeled and actually be compatible with another Motorola phone, but I have no way to find out as I only own an i530
although prince is an utter genious! this cd is merely a boring contract filler. i suggest you buy one of his older albums or the new album "musicology" instead
Anyone who really loves a gourmet cup of coffee will HATE this! It's burnt, bitter, weak, battery-acid! And, as consequence, those coffee lovers may begin to hate their new Senseo -- but take heart! Many online coffee shops now offer decent to delectable coffees at prices that rival this cheap swill. I don't specifically want to endorse any one product or online retailer but do a google search for "senseo compatible pods" and you'll find several on the first page. Also, please note that while these may initially seem pricier, most third party pods work with JUST ONE to make an 8-ounce cup instead of the two pods that Senseo brand products demand. You do the math and it works out to be a comparable costing cup of joe.  ---  --- [...
I bought this toy for my 4 year old grandaugher.  Since Barbie rides this horse of course a little girl will want her doll to ride the horse.  The wings fall off.  We must put the wings back on at least a dozen time a day
Love this scent. Definately not too strong and it seems to last quite a while. Perfect for everyday wear. It has a strong undertone of vanilla so if that's not your bag I wouldn't recommend it
I am not at all happy with this product. The instructions are terrible and the program is not at all intuitive. It was a total waste of my money and time.
The introduction in the owner's manual states it perfectly.  Rode said that when looking for a good camcorder microphone, they were either horrible pieces of junk or super expensive professional models and so they decided to design a mic for this purpose.  This model strikes a perfect balance.  The quality of this mic is excellent.  It is very sensitive and has good directional properties so it rejects noise to the side quite well.  Although not meant for picking up sound from long distances it can do quite well from 20 feet away and maybe more. ---  --- The mount is attached to the mic so this is the only way you can use it and it is made to mount to the standard "shoe" that is on nearly all camcorders.  It is a mono microphone but it has a stereo miniphone jack that plugs in the camcorder mic jack and feeds the audio into both channels.  After trying several inferior microphones I was delighted to stumble upon this mic.  It is a good value and an excellent microphone for camcorders
I did not find this book very helpful. There is an entire chapter dedicated to which expensive pots are the best to "invest" in (it seems the pricier the better, and I mean several hundred dollars, I  actually went to stores and priced the recommended brands) and what kind of  fancy kitchen gadgets are needed to create gourmet meals.  I am not a  professional chef, just a simple housewife that enjoys preparing simple,  good-tasting meals for my family, the recipes here seem to be  time-consuming and complicated.  Not much money to be saved here
I purchased this for my nephew and my daughter as a present.  I was significantly disappointed.  With this item having the Smithsonian name on it, I expected better construction.  While trying to assemble the item, the plastic cracked on the one.  The tubes and caps were so loose that I was afraid the bugs would get out into my house.  I put silicone around the extremely loose ones.  However, I did not seal everything so the critters could breathe.  For the price, there are other similar items out there with better construction
I remember seeing this movie years ago in college and have continued to like it ever since.  The movie starts off at the 1988 Calgary Olympics.  Doug Dorsey (D.B. Sweeny) is a talented hockey player and Kate Mosley (Moira Kelly) is a pairs figure skater.  Both have mishaps during their big moments, Doug suffering a career ending injury and Kate falling during her performace and failing to meet her own expectations.   ---  --- The movie picks up a few years later with Kate having trouble getting a new partner and Doug is on the skids unable to fulfill his dream of becoming a star hockey player.  Added to the mix is Kate's Russian couch Anton Pamchenko (played by the great Roy Dotrice) who decides Rick will be Kate's new partner as they struggle to get back to the 1992 Olympics. ---  --- At first glance this is a sports movie about figure skating, but that is not entirely so.  The scenes involving the leads on the ice are surprisingly abstract as neither is a professional skater.  In truth this is a character driven story and most of the action takes place off the ice.  It is absolutely charming to watch the two lead characters go from a dislike of one another, to extreme rivalry and finally ending up in love.  The thing that absolutely makes this happen is the chemestry between the leads Sweeney and Kelly.  They are magic together on the screen, so much so that I am surprised they never paired up again for another movie.   ---  --- I highly recommend this light hearted romance to everyone. ---  ---  --- On a side note about the DVD, the only special feature is the theatrical trailer.  There are no deleted scenes.  This is where I have a question, because the version of the film on this DVD and that I've scene on TV in recent years is not the one I remember seeing in college.  I distinctly remember the end scene was the medal ceremony.  I somewhat like that version because what Doug and Kate won in that version was so much more.  So where is the version with the alternative ending???
Walzer's historical approach to examining just war theory is, I think, the most useful way to understand morality in war. That is so because empirical facts back up all the philosophical evaluations. Walzer describes experience and draws conslusions here; he is laying a philosophical foundation and implying, if not prescribing, moral norms from which the rules have been extracted. Be forewarned, he does not cut the reader any slack. This book requires some serious attention to the author's train of thought.   ---  --- Just war theory has two categories: the justice of going to war, and the justice of fighting once in a war. Walzer's discussion usefully and clearly separates the two and examines via historical events what we regard as right and wrong within each sphere. In doing this he has done the modern world a tremendous service. His logical breakdown speaks to thousands of years of tradition about what thinkers have considered right and wrong in war. One of the best outcomes of this landmark work is the complete debunking of the notion that "all is fair in love and war." That is the path of least moral resistance (or as Clausewitz would say, "friction"), yet we all know that soldiers are honored for fighting well and loathed for behaving like armed thugs and murderers. What is amazing from the discusion is the realization that Walzer knows he has to attack that age-old notion, something our collective sense of justice has historically always rejected.  Yet it remains a prevailing idea for many.  Originally coined by the Romans it seems (Walzer quotes them, "In war the laws are silent"), they themselves were self-consciously contrite over the fates they inflicted on the Greeks and Carthginians.  The book rates five stars for rigorously addressing this issue alone. ---  --- Some make the mistake of thinking Walzer is a pacifist--far from it.  On the otherside some critics find his argument about "supreme emergency" a moral failure and a cop-out.  The case of Nazi Germany is his paradigmatic case of supreme emergency, one where normal rules may be relaxed, if ever so little, because of the especially pernicious nature of state-sponsored genocide.  The same relaxation of restraints would likely apply to Islamic terror. In contrast Walzer does not see Imperial Japan, for instance, as having represented a supreme emergency, and so the atomic bombings and the fire bombings of cities could not be morally justified. Readers may want to compare his view to Paul Fussell's perspective in the essay "Thank God for the Atom Bomb." ---  --- Significantly for current events, readers interested in the distinction between pre-emptive and preventive war will find a well articulated argument here. The US attack on Iraq was and still is often justified as pre-emptive.  That impulse on the part of the neo-conservatives who devised or whipped up the casus belli reflects, I think, a need to cloak a morally questionable war in the robes of legitimacy. There is no way that attack can be justified under the historically accepted norms of "pre-emption." Michael Walzer's well-thought distinction between pre-emption and prevention makes sense even in the milieu of asymmetric warfare against terror and Islamic radicalism, and it clearly shows why the Iraq war was a moral mistake from the start, regardless of its practical success down the road, if we are fortunate enough to see that. The moral precedent of engaging in preventive war will continue to haunt America long into the future. The fact that Iraq was not even on the spectrum where the fine line between pre-emption and prevention exists is a telling aspect of the overall ongoing strategic fiasco.  Where one fails to recognize the moral high ground, one is doomed to moral failure. Walzer was vocal about the run-up to war in 2003, and those who read his book would do well to find his comments about the Iraq invasion; they are edifying in terms of understanding the overall argument and where we are going in this role as the world's police force
for $20 bucks...After finally figuring out that I had to turn my mic inputs ALL the way up, I still can't get more than a -20db signal from my guitar...Save your money..
I have these and the worms, I LOVE them because they are soft...I highly recommend them
This magazine transports you to a different world.  Every issue is a wish-book, with holiday cooking to plan over the upcoming month, or crafts to do over your next long weekend, or a bookcase to try to paint for a new room.  Well, in my life, years go by and I dream on.  But just leafing through this magazine erases so many cramped, negative, angry thoughts.  I will never laugh at "crafty" people again.  I will also probably never actually accomplish anything so beautifully pictured inside, but the dreams are sweet.   ---  --- The expert information regarding vintage items and preservation alone is fascinating, but then you have gardening, cooking, baking, furniture, decorating, beading, anything do-it-yourself.  Martha is truly a wonder woman.  Worth every cent
It is probably too late to save anyone from this software but I had to say something about it to someone. There is apparently no way to tell taxcut about it.  --- I have been using taxcut for several years now after switching from turbotax because of the issue of them installing spyware. I was happy with taxcut until this year. It is defective. I can't even believe it isn't in the news. My taxcut program is missing the "wages" entry on the Schedule C form. It would have been a terrible loss if I had not caught it. I went to their website to get some help or a phone number and neither was available. I can't believe that I have the only taxcut software that is defective but I couldn't find any reference to this problem anywhere. Now I have to go through the whole tax form to make sure it didn't make any other mistakes! I might as well have done my taxes the old fashioned way by hand.
This book was very helpul in learning about how to handle my dog
This magazine is devoted to American inventions and technology that have affected our lives.  In essence, this magazine is a historical magazine about American technology.  Within each issue are multiple articles about a historical invention.  The articles can either focus on the technology or focus on an individual who has been a key contributor to the advancement of that technology.  Typically, each issue also has an interview with an inventor or inventors whose contributions have materially affected our lives or society.   ---  --- The scope of the magazine is broad.  There have been articles on the Trans-Canada highway.  Another recent issue had an excellent article on tunnel boring machines.  In yet another article the development of refinery cracking was described in the context of the development of higher performance engines.  The contribution of high octane gasoline to the winning of the air war was mentioned, an interesting piece of trivia of which I was previously unaware. ---  --- The scope of the magazine is beyond the physical sciences.  Biology and the development of medical technology are also covered.  While the magazine is written at a level that an educated non-expert can understand, some of the biology related articles challenge my attention. ---  --- This magazine is an excellent source of technological history.  However, while the technical jargon used is that appropriate to a technology, this magazine is not light reading for those unfamiliar with a specific field.  As an example, I had to read portions of the article on refinery cracking a couple of times to understand the general description of how the cracking process works.  Therefore, while I highly recommend this magazine to anyone with an interest in the history of technology, realize that for some readers, for example elementary school students, this magazine could present a reading challenge. ---  --- Most articles also provide pictures or other artwork.  Frequently this artwork is unavailable from any other magazine source because there are so few magazines that deal with technological history.  The quality of the images varies because many of the pictures have not been well-preserved, but in many cases they are the only pictures available. ---  --- This magazine frequently mentions the Inventor's Hall of Fame in Akron, Ohio, which is sponsored by the United States Patent & Trademark Office.  A number of articles have covered inductees to the Inventor's Hall of Fame, showing that while the articles are historical in nature, they are also currently relevant. ---  --- There are a large number of magazines that are either about technology, or have had articles about technology.  There are a large number of trade magazines that cover technology.  Sometimes these magazines even have articles about the history of an invention.  However, the "American Heritage of Invention & Technology" is the only magazine of which I am aware the covers the history of invention and technology.  While the focus of the articles is American technology, it is inevitable that the relationship of foreign invention is covered occasionally as well when that technology was important in the development of American technology.  I consider this magazine to be excellent for anyone with an interest in historical technology, and is an excellent complement to other historical magazines.
I'm not really a golf player.  But what I saw of the golf set was that the bag's cover protection from rain has a missing zipper stopper
The fast delivery and reasonable price for these shoes almost make me ignore the not so perfect pair of shoes I received. --- They look like some floor model and somewhat tried on with part of the heels on both shoes cut off resembling rejects. --- I am sure I will not show them off much when I wear them
i would recommend this to those who just wants more than just shooting at fat ass people or aliens just slobbering on cra
Panasonic offers a USB driver however no video driver. This means that anyone using windows xp will be unable to transfer video to their computer. When talking to panasonic they just said they didnt have a driver and were not developing one. They offered no suggestions or alternatives
Excelente opcion para aquellos que manejan mucho. Permite una buena ventilación en la espalda y el apoyo lumbar es adecuado para largas horas de manejo sin sufrir de fatiga.  --- Se le colocó a un Hyundai Getz 2007 y a un Geo Metro 1994 y a ambos automoviles se acopló perfectamente. --- El unico punto en contra es que no queda muy claro como se debe sujetarse al asiento y no viene con instrucciones.  --- ---- --- Excellent option for all people who drives a lot per day. Allows an excellent air pass trough the back and it has great lumbar support reducing fatigue. --- I put it on a Hyundai Getz 2007 and Geo Metro 1994 and fits perfect in both cars. --- CON: You have to figure out how to put it on the seat.
Unless you are prepared to be constantly putting the ropes and the masts back on the ship, this toy is a complete waste of money. My son had been wanting the Black Pearl for quite some time and this was a huge disappointment to him.  Buyer beware
Works great. Cooking space on grill holds a large amount of meat, fish,etc..  We would like to see a canister that holds more gas than for cooking only five meals.
My Motorola C139 with Net10 crashed on me.  I called Net10 and they promptly sent me out a new phone, except they sent me this flip phone (V171).  I liked my candy bar phone and didn't want this flip piece of junk.  I was happy with Net10 service up to the point of my old phone failing, and then things quickly went downhill.  Net10 would not transfer my number to the replacement phone, even though I had minutes available on the old phone.   ---  --- I gave my wife the V171 to use and took back from her our Cingular phone, which works awesome with no problems.  She had problems all the time with the V171.  She had to always type in the area codes for all numbers dialed, even the local numbers.  She also had problems trying to dial a number and the phone would not dial after pressing all the numbers in the phone and hitting send.  In my opinion, the V171 is completely worthless. ---  --- Overall, I am a very dissatisfied customer.  My recommendation is to stay away from this phone and this service.  Go shop Cingular for all the great deals they have
Broke the day after I got it. But when it worked I loved it
This year, 60% of college entries will be female.  Look at this spring's honor role listings.  Last year, 78% of honor role members in my community were female.  Schools are fails boys - not girls. ---  --- If you wish to waste your time on a politically correct diatribe that is full of anecdotal and subjective pap, then get this book.  If you want to really improve the quality of education, there are thousands of reads better than this
This is probably one of the best booster packs out there. Every monster that comes in the pack has an effect. Effect monsters can be very useful. Not to mention that my very first Pharaonic Guardian pack came with a secret rare! That is one of only two of the most rare cards in the whole pack! Even the common cards are great. Such as Giant axe mummy or the Gravekeeper cards! Your deck cannot be complete without this booster pack! I highly suggest this pack
Having been a fan of Joan Osborne's take of "Son of a Preacher Man" on her original indie record and "Heat Wave" from the recent 'Standing in the Shadows of Motown' soundtrack, I was looking forward to hearing this record of covers.  I was ultimately disappointed. ---  --- First of all, I have to say, there are two real gems on here that really needed to be updated, one for its amazing vocal/instrumental sound (The Spinners' "I'll Be There") and the other for its message (Timmy Thomas' "Why Can't We Live Together"). ---  --- To be sure, there are some great tunes on here that I am always up for listening to, such as Stevie Wonder's "Love's In Need of Love Today" and Undisputed Truth's "Smiling Faces Somtimes", but Osborne adds little to these.  When she does change things around, the effect is questionable.  I know that Norah Jones has brought back the torch song style, but Osborne's bluesy take on Edwin Starr's "War" is seriously misguided.  The same is true when you rip the melody and add bland vocals to classics like Aretha Franklin's "Think" or The Band's "The Weight" - especially since the former could have really used some punch from such a powerful singer like Osborne. ---  --- Overall, this was a missed opportunity.  I hope her upcoming 2005 record is a reinvention
I purchased this watch as a birthday present for my husband.  When he opened it he noticed that the days of the week were in both Spanish and English, and there doesn't seem to be a way to set it to just one or the other, since there were limited instructions with the watch.  By the time he looked at it there was no way for us to return it for a refund. Not happ
This item is more of a foot and ankle massager if you have long legs.  I am tall with a 37" inseam.  This item is not made for someone who has longer than "average" legs unless you're looking for a foot and ankle massage rather than a calf massage. 
I purchased two cushions to use on small chairs.  When the cushions I arrived, I could hardly believe how small they were, smaller than the description stated.  In addition to the small size, the cushions had a lot of stuffing and seemed more like volleyballs than chair cushions. 
The card works great in my camera.  No problems.  I would recommend the product
I'm not sure about all that other nonsense the reviewer before me is talking about (sounds like someone with an axe to grind)but this album is a stunning piece of workmanship. The music is inspired, the melodies transcending, and the emotion - deep and meaningful. As far as "copying Yanni" goes, well - I don't agree, in fact, Yanni is far more generic and less inspired. The sound samples the cranky reviewer alludes to are in fact NOT the same nor, are they Yanni's creation. I write this review to commend mr farish on his work, and to take to task the idiot who misinformed others and couldn't resist his own urge to see his "critique" in print. Ryans music is distinctly his own, no question - and any similarities are tonal, and not compositional - which the reveiwer would be well advised to take note of. As far as I'm concerned, you be the judge - and let cranky wannabe music critics continue to wallow in their own self hate as they surf store shelve's and websites for music to criticize - and well, make themselves feel a little better. Personally, I would recommend this album to anyone who likes strong songs with great production and uplifting energy. All the other stuff is for hacks! enjoy this music! I do.
An awesome watch. I absolutely love it. Incredible value at this price
I liked this product so much-I'm buying some for my family members who live out of town!  Only a small amount leaves my hair feeling soft, shiny and moisturized.  And it's great on my ends-especially with roller sets! Plus, my darling hubby loves the scent. I use it along with the Khoret Amen Hair Oil
Pros:  --- * Awesome graphics --- * Huge world to explore --- * Great story line --- * Easy to play --- * You could to kill colossal enemies ---  --- Cons: --- * All you do is kill the 16 Colossi. There are no real side quests except to get power ups and replay to try the Battle attack.
I agree with Ms Hunters review, for me too many ads not enough depth on our relevant subjects
I previously left a very positive review of the shampoo and conditioner, however, after using it for several days, my hair feels heavy, dirty and coated with something.  I know Jonathan loves his product "Dirt" but it does not belong in a volumizing product for women with fine, limp hair.  I don't need anything else to weight my hair down.  It does not feel clean after washing and drying it.  I am quite disappointed as I really loved the way both products smelled. I had to wash my hair a second time today because it would not do what I wanted it to do and it felt like the "second day" after washing it. I still recommend the volumizing foam.  That is a nice product.  Smells wonderful and does not weight your hair down or cause it to become full of static as products with a lot of alcohol do.
If you liked the first Disgaea you will just love the second one!  The game builds upon all the strong points of the previous game.  Now instead of taking FOREVER to get powerful characters you can achieve characters like the archer, ninja, etc. much quicker.  The main characters are still hilarious, and I love the fact that you get to see Laharl, Etna and the gang again in this one.  (Go Prism Rangers =/). ---  --- Once again the plot isn't too twisted, but it is enjoyable.  ---  --- Back to the game play though, its similar to the old one, but you have more options.  For one, you can JOIN the Dark Assembly.  In the item world you can not only level your item, but go to an assembly, improve the luck of your item, and purchase items such as alcohol and bombs to influence  the assembly.   ---  --- There is also the new addition of the subpoena.  These are felony charges that your characters receive based upon too many murders, too much hp etc. etc.  These are "medals of honor" in the demon world, and allow your characters more prestige, not to mention they once again make you want to go to the item world. Another bonus, you can transfer the bailiff for your subpoena onto your item, so you can get a felony charge, and level your item at the same time. ---  --- This game is a fabulous addition to any gamer's collection, and I highly recommend it!  Enjoy
Interview is one of my favorite magazines. The interviews are always good. I think that the interviews are more candid since it's done by peers. I also think that the photo shoots in the Interview are some of the best around
I bought this product for my husband. He tried it out on one of the hottest days. Sunny and 90 degrees. He is very particular on how he washes our vehicles and it usually takes a few hours. This really works. Not only did it cut the time it takes to wash the cars but it is amazing. It looked as if he did the vehicles the old way. There were no streaks. The truck looked like it was polished. Unbelievable...... I would recommend this product to anyone. Buy it !!!!!!
This tea is fabulous!  And what a great deal!  I will be buying more of this tea!  It is better than green tea
I found Turbotax easy to use.  It gave me the flexibility of filling in individual forms rather than using the interview process.  Since I am an experienced tax preparer, I found this feature welcome
I like most of AC/DC's music, but I can't stand their latest album Stiff Upper Lip.  Stiff Upper Lip is the only AC/DC album where you can play it all the way through, and not even hear one good song.  Stiff Upper Lip doesn't even come close to being as good as Back in Black or Highway to Hell.  Every song on it just bugs the heck out of me.  Listening to one song off this album is enough to test my patience; but enduring all 12 of these musical abominations is enough to drive me crazy!  The overall sound is very similar to their earlier albums like Highway to Hell or Back in Black.  BUT...those CDs had variety, they were semi original, and they were actually pretty good.  THIS CD is just completely worthless.  I have heard some cra ppy CDs in my lifetime, but none of them were more pain to listen to than this.  The vocalist sounds about 10 times worse than he did on their earlier albums, the music is chunky, repetitive, dull, and boring, and most of the songs sound the same. Stiff Upper Lip is so bland and dull sounding that it sounds more like the monotonous droning of an electric fan than a rock n roll band.  The music is so repetitive and similar sounding that its more like listening to the same annoying song for 60 minutes than 12 separate tracks.  This CD is just unbelievaby terrible.  It is a disgrace to this band's legacy, and the band members should be embarrased by it.  Oh well, I guess they probably only made this album because they needed to fulfill their record contract, so I guess they don't care about how awful it is anyway.  All I can tell you potential buyers is to stay as far away from this piece of garbage as possible.  It is a TOTAL piece of cr ap and it is not fit to listen to.  Go buy a GOOD AC/DC CD like Let there Be Rock, High Voltage, Powerage, Highway to Hell, or Back in Black.  Stiff Upper Lip suc ks so hard it leaves a big purple bruise.  It's so awful I'd rather listen to the new Nickelback CD than this!
I was fortunate to be able to see a live preformance in my home town about 12 years ago. I don't beleive that this effort is "up to par". 
Seriously, I am an expert, and this movie sucks. But, imagine for a moment--yes, stop and withdraw from your metaphysical prejudices--a movie whose premise is truly profound, strikingly engaging, and culturally challenging--that art is only such relative to those individuals, those `experts', whose tastes, likes and dislikes, decide it so. Given that aesthetic claims are empirically nonsensical--a matter of pure subjective opinion--why is it that some art is valued at all while some not at all? Besides this interesting question, which is put forth explicitly, without the pretentious riddles of terrible poetry, and in about 60 seconds, the rest of the movie is obnoxious editing and narration. Avoid at all costs.
This chocolate has ruined me for any other.  If you like the Dove dark chocolate candy you will love this.  It's smooth and creamy, like drinking a dark chocolate bar.  And it's not fattening.  Only 100 calories dissolved in 1/3 c. milk; yet it seems to make about 1/2 cup.  That's all you need.  It's rich, filling, and very satisfying.  I just wish amazon had the complete list of products.  This is not for people that like hershey's chocolate!     
First they started out as nu-metal, then they moved onto metalcore, and now psuedo-death metal. It should be no surprise to the fools who listen to this garbage that they are clearly following trends, and after each trend dies, they just move on to another one. If my calculations are correct, expect a psuedo-black metal release. ---  --- But, what about the musicians? Sure, they have a fast drummer...who likes to trigger alot, then they have two guitarists...who like to steal Pantera riffs, and then they have the singer, who, well, sounds just like all the rest. Atleast they dont have the DJ anymore (oh wait, they do, nevermind.) ---  --- Enough of my rambling, how does this untalented group of posers fair up? Well, image if Mushroomhead went metalcore. 'Nuff said. ---  --- Avoid
Does the job nicely. I am not an audiophile so I dont get into the nit picking when it comes to speaker wire. Just tell me what gauge to use and I do it. Seemed high quality to me
Sickly weak queasy stomach after eating the bar for 4 hours or more. I havent felt so yuky and sickly in a long time.

This book gives a thorough analysis on how public policies were the catalysts for the socioeconomic destruction of low-income communities of color in New York City. Necessary reading for those who still do not  realize that activism and organizing are important vehicles through which  marginalized communities keep in check the forces that seek to further  fragment and disenfranchise them
I normally buy Special K cereal.  I found these boxes to be stale
The compass is wholly unreliable.  The light button turns on in your bag, thus draining the battery.  One of my worst Amazon purchases
It's October 8th, 2006.  The Detroit Tigers have just defeated the New York Yankees to advance to the American League Championship Series.   People counted the Tigers out.  Everyone thought the Yankees would walk into Comerica Ballpark and put a serious damper on the success the Tigers have produced all season long.  Nope.  Didn't happen.  The Tigers won 95 games this year.  No one thought the Tigers advancing this far was possible, but when you have excellent stars such as Magglio Ordonez, Curtis Granderson, Ivan Rodriguez, Marcus Thames, Craig Monroe and Kenny Rogers, you can't lose.  The manager Jim Leyland also played a major part in helping to reshape the Tigers as a team, and give them much-needed direction.  He was probably the main reason they won so many games.   ---  --- The Tigers are now a team EVERYONE can love- not just Detroit fans.  TV stations are now playing Tigers games again and reminding people that yes, the Tigers are still around.  The fact that the Tigers haven't been mentioned for the last 10 years shows that the fans may have forgotten all about the team, but beating the Yankees last night was solid proof the team is back, and threatening.  Proof that the Tigers can hang with the big boys.   ---  --- The celebration after the final out in game 4 was wonderful.  Everyone on the team lifted Jim Leyland on their shoulders and proudly walked around the field, while the fans celebrated and cheered indicating they still remember those successful championship years a long time ago, and obviously still support their home team.  It got extremely crazy when the team decided to spray champagne at the audience, and they enjoyed it!  Even a cop wanted to be sprayed.  The celebration supposedly lasted an hour.   ---  --- This Vintage Crest T-Shirt should PROUDLY be worn by you.  I want you to take a trip to New York City wearing this shirt and walk down the street so everyone can see how much of a proud, loyal Detroit Tigers fan you are.  The days of watching them lose game after game are finally over.  Long live the Tigers.  Make sure you buy this shirt to celebrate the wonderful run the Tigers had in the season of 2006.  You need to wear Orange if you live in the Detroit area. 
These are very cute tinkerbell dice for your rearview mirror.  They are a little smaller than average dice, but I like the size they are even better.  Cute accessory for my car
This film offers none of the cheap thrills of a horror film, and has many flaws:  a silly plot, cheap religious imagery (Dracula is Judas, jeez louise), and not one truly sexy or scary moment. And it wastes three gorgeous gals as Dracula's brides, including Jennifer Esposito & Jeri Ryan. If you can't make a film sexy with these two, you're in the wrong business. Craven has an over inflated rep as a director, he doesn't deserve any rep as a producer, if this leaden film is a sample. It makes the worse Universal horror film look like Citizen Kane in comparison.  --- Save your money and pick up something scary instead, like Bava's Black Sunday or any Hammer horror
High quality, well constructed cooker.  Delivery was quick.  We are very pleased with our purchase
A standard 5' bar. Not sure how accurate the weight is. It feels more than 13 pounds, but that could just be me. Not a big deal either way
Can the book reviewers please pay attention. This is not the book, this is the VHS movie section. I see many book reviews, but not a single movie review. I'm glad everyone liked the book, but we need to see if the movie is any good here. I am sure it has alot going for it based upon the book, but I have seen some movies do a terrible job. What about this VHS movie? Has anyone actually seen it? Also can someone tell me how to get people to sell it for a reasonable price. Used rental copies for $22 to 125 is outrageous. One can only hope it comes out on DVD and these scalpers lose money
It is definatly a total 80's movie!  Packed full of cheesy music and themes!  But I love it!  Teen Witch is a feel good movie about being okay with being different!  Gotta love that
This is a pretty good product for the price! I've found a few errors on location of addresses, but all in all, pretty good! Just wish Microsoft will offer a commercial vehicle version sometime in the near future. So far, we've had no complaints. --- 
My 2 year old son loves to "cook" and to serve Mommy and Daddy meals from his kitchen.  My only complaint is that it falls over easily and it seems we are often picking it up off the floor.  It isn't very sturdy, but I'm not unhappy with this purchase
Bear Naked Granola is just fabulous. I've tried every granola around, and Bear Naked strikes the right balance between crunchy, sweet, and ostensibly, good for you. And Amazon's price certainly beats what you'd pay at the store.
I loved having this easy-swaddleme wrap!  It was so much easier than getting a blanket and swaddling where it might come apart.  The velcro worked really well as it gave "room to grow."  Swaddling our daughter only lasted for about a month or two, she just totally outgrew this.  It was great while it lasted and it's a fantastic shower gift
I believe this is the best game in the genre.  It's gotten more play out of me than Master of Magic, Heroes of Might and Magic, Age of Wonders, Warlords, Disciples, Civilization, Alpha Centauri, Master of Orion, Space Empires, or Stars.  Once of the other posters says they have bad support, but that's not been my experience.  I've found their continued support and patches to be as good or better than any of the afore mentioned titles -- not bad for a 2 man team. ---  --- There is an amazing amount of variety in factions and would-be-gods you can play, and best of all it is for the most part solidly based upon Mythology -- far superior to the typically D&D derivative fantasy.  Multiplayer is fantastic. ---  --- It is a complex game however, and not to everyone's tastes. Definitely check out the demo first.  Beware though, it's addictive stuff! ---  --- Also check out the fan made maps on their website as well, some of which are quite pretty.  If you're stuck getting started, try the excellent Walkthrough by Bruce Geryk, also linked from their site
Well, it sounds funny, but it sure is pretty.   ---  --- I wanted to make my own beads because some I purchased for making jewelry lost their outer coating and turned white!  And these were glass beads.... ---  --- I found Sculpey and ordered the 10 pack to see how it would work.  The colors are beautiful and the clay holds its shape, mixes well for marbling and blends to form additional colors. ---  --- To make your creations permanent, just bake them in your oven at low temperatures. ---  --- Easy as this is, Sculpey's baking instructions (use glass, 15 minutes per 1/4 inch, etc.,) are a little too specific for my taste.  As a beginner, I find it troublesome that some of the things I am baking may be thicker than others and therefore undercooked, or the thinner ones may burn if I try to compensate, so do I bake them separately?@!*&! or what?   ---  --- I notice old handers just seem to lower the temperature and cook everything 30 minutes.  I'm not that brave yet.   ---  --- But so far, nothing has burned and nothing has turned back to raw clay so I must be doing something right.  Or Sculpey is more cooperative than its makers know.... ---  --- I'm actually quite proud of some of my beads now, and I've been at if for less than a month.  Sculpey can get you off to a good start too
I went to a sports store and all they carried were sportline pedometers.  I really didn't know which one to buy so I bought this one because it was more attractive than the bright yellow one and it was more expensive than the 340 so I thought it was better somehow.  Even though it says that it measures steps accurately on the packaging, it doesn't actually display it.  It only uses it to calculate the distance that you've walked.  I was very annoyed by this because the 340 does track and display the number of steps walked.  I got over it but the thing keeps resetting in my pocket.  I'm just going to buy another pedometer.  One that displays the steps walked and has a cover
I've been making holiday turkeys for over 30 years.  This year for the first time I used Turkey Perfect...and without a doubt this was the best, moistest, most flavorful turkey I've ever done.  I told a friend about this product; she called me to rave about her absolutely delicious turkey.  Even relatives who don't really like turkey went back for seconds...and thirds...  For the first time ever we had NO turkey leftovers this year
I purchased this smoker last summer.  The assembly was simple.  One piece of hardware was missing, but had no trouble replacing the nut that holds the thermometer in place.  I replaced the factory regulator with an adjustable unit and can get any level of heat I desire.  It is sensitive to wind though.   
Maybe I'm daft, but I can't make a decent espresso with these pods in my machine. I've tried tamping them, which doesn't work well and I've tried just placing them in the filter. In both cases I get watery dribble but no espresso. ---  --- As with other European products (think IKEA) there are no printed instructions in English, just line art drawings. Perhaps I'm just doing something wrong. ---  --- I like the concept of pods, but I'll stick to beans instead
I dont take neither stance on Religion nor Science with these comments. ---  --- I have read the book and I have to admit that it was marketed and was presented brilliantly. It has one goal... Sell, sell, sell. ---  --- If you are after useful, quality, informative, knowledge to gain... well you wont find it here. Im so shocked to even see that when you check the back cover of the book it actually says "non-fiction". ---  --- The author is a talented story teller...... add a few statistics here and there, a dash of scientific key figures, mix it with life's controversial unsolved mysteries, a few more dash of historic events and famous people, add and link a few references here and there, and WALA!!!! you have a best seller. ---  --- Isnt that ironic! it is a "New York Times number 1 best seller"  --- It was an interesting read though.
This is the best CD I have ever listened to! I highly recommend i
I've been using Wordperfect for about 25 years and it keeps getting better.  It is the best word processor by far.  So many things are better than Microsoft's word processors.  Importing graphics, mail labels, and especially reveal codes to name a few.
This romantic comedy was charming, funny, and clever. I recommend it to anyone who doesn't have a problem with heavy British accents. (If you do, try it with captions). It was fun, funny, and a nice pick-me-up when one needs a lift
I purchased this watch for my granddaughter as her first watch.  However, it never worked.  I don't know if it had a dead battery or if it's broken.  The cost to replace the battery will be nearly as much as I paid for the watch.  I will try to resolve the issue with Amazon
I bought two flavors of Gloria Jeans k-cups. I loved the price. The coffee is wonderful(!), but I hate getting grounds in my coffee! I've had about 1 in 5 cups that have coffee grounds *under* the filter, so when the coffee brews they end up in my cup--about a 1/2 teaspoon per cup. Lower price = poorer manufacturing standards.
Home and Beyond and True Value offers this 12 pack of coffee filters with 40 in each pack. I ordered two 12 packs of 40 coffee filters each and Home and Beyond only sent two packs of 40. Not the 24 packs I ordered and paid for. My advice is do not do business with Home and Beyond or True Value when buying these coffee filters because they do not ship what the listing says. Until Amazon starts enforcing Home and Beyond and True Value to honor what they list in their offerings, IMHO then the buyers need to go somewhere else. Weight says 4.20 pounds. Are they trying to say one tiny pack of 40 paper coffee filters weighs 4.20 pounds??
 I thought that this would be an ideal product for my aging father as both his sight and his dexterity are somewhat impaired. My first thought was to contact the parent company, Hy-Tek Manufacturing, to ask for a dealer referral and to get some answers to a few simple operations questions. After 3 days they did get back to me, recommending Amazon as a purchase source but ignoring my request for operations information. I sent a second email but it was completely ignored. Maybe this should have been a warning. ---  ---  I decided to go ahead and order one anyway. The purchasing process was quick and easy and delivery form Amazon's agent was about 5 days, more than acceptable. The unit comes well packaged with easy to follow instructions. Actual programming is simple and very straight forward. The problems started after successfully programming my dad's satellite receiver. The main menu could not be accessed, the information button was non-functional and two of the numeric keys did not work. I tried all of the codes listed for the manufacturer of that receiver, none of them made any difference. ---  ---  Another email to Hy-Tek, and another 3 day wait, produced the response " it doesn't work with all devices and I guess it just won't work with your receiver, you'll have to send it back to the supplier. We will make note of this and maybe we can add this receiver in a future update. " No help at all and no concern or consideration expressed on the part of the manufacturer. If they had bothered to respond to my original inquiry in the first place, I would never have purchased this substandard piece of equipment and wouldn't have been out the freight charges. One of the questions that I asked originally was " will it access the main menu? ", but they didn't have the common courtesy to respond. ---  ---  Be aware that this remote will not work with all devices. Even simple, necessary functions like menu and numbers may not be accessible. The manufacturer is slow to respond to customer inquiries and less than helpful if and when they do. Would I recommend or purchase this item again, absolutely not
yeah, ok, Ice Cube is a bounty hunter and Mike Epps is a criminal who ends up teaming up with him to defeat the badguys,am I right on that...right. the story is great but not that great. so many holes and so many stupid supporting characters doesnt make up for the seemingly endless movie with a taste in your mouth that sits there and then makes your mouth all icky, thats what it was like for me folks. god I almost fell asleep at that photo shootout and then the other one where at the end with the boat and superlame climax. put some thought into your head as you are about to watch this. for Cube and Epps and Eva Mendes fans only. and if you wanna see an old lady in a raincoat like coat with a thong bikini on it, then this is the film for you
We have the original "Super Mastermind" which is the exact same layout.  It's fun and enjoyable year after year but too many games at one sitting can cause a headache.  It's fun to watch others work at it too.  The pieces are small so should be kept away from little kids but age 10 and up seem to enjoy it.  It's a great addition to our game shelf and we are getting more to give as gifts
The Good: --- * I couldn't find these in bricks-and-mortar stores at all, and it was a relief to purchase them affordably through a vendor I trust. --- * The 1-lb weight inserts make it easy to adjust the weight, with the cuff on or off. --- * I have been using them for about two weeks, and the effect on my workout - and my legs - is tremendous. ---  --- The Bad: --- * The cuffs are "adjustable" with two LONG velcro straps that wrap all the way around the ankle.  No matter how carefully I wrap them, I just can't get them as tight as I'd like.  Straps which wrap  double back through D-rings would have been much more useful. --- * The cuffs tend to ride down and dig into the tops of my feet. Cushioned by gel or not, I can't exactly call that "comfortable."  I'm not sure whether this is specific to this brand, or typical of ankle weight cuffs. ---  --- Overall: --- I do wish I'd been able to try these and some other brands before I purchased them.  However, I'm delighted to have found them and with the results I'm seeing
I purchased these boots for my daughter.  I bought two pairs for her younger sister and she fell in love with the look.  She tried them on at a local sporting store and just loved how they hugged and felt on her feet.  I would buy all colors of the rainbow if she asked
Worthless. It rips off your battery door when you try to take the phone off. Flimsy and broke within a week. Not even worth the 0.01 I paid for it which is sad. :
This product isn't a miracle product, but it does do a few things: it supports your back, it is comfortable, it does make you sweat (mostly on your waistline) and therefore does make you lose some inches and also detoxes you a little bit.   It's not a bad product overall, but don't expect a miracle... you have to do the work for this product to help you at all.  I do use it any time I'm doing an aerobic workout to enhance overall affects
The shoes are comfortable. Easy to wear and feel great with or without socks!
I have seen many craft magazines come and go.  I hope this one goes.  Granted, there is no commercial advertising in it, but paying anything over $1.98 per issue would be too much.  The crafts are mainly useless, juvenile, and lack polish.  I purchased my subscription sight unseen because it was through supporting a local school (the only saving grace to this whole experience), but that is a mistake I will not make again.  It took at least three months after ordering it that I finally received my first issue.  I opened it with great expectation of finding original and practical crafts for my home, but was immediately thoroughly disappointed. Thankfully, my subscription will be expiring soon.  ---  --- If you are a serious crafter, I recommend passing by this one.
I really enjoyed this movie. Not the typical "John Boy" movie. I have not seen the original, although I have recently purchased it. I will be able to make a better comparison once I have seen it. By itself, however, it holds it's own
Well constructed blazer. Great color. You can wear with jeans or shirt and tie for church.
I bought this eyeliner expecting great things, and was sorely disappointed.  Application is difficult, mistakes are almost impossible to correct even if done immediately, and I can't soften the line (it *is* smudgeproof).  If you are used to a brush-on-liquid-liner, have a very steady hand, and want a dramatic look, this might work for you.  I prefer a softer line, so this didn't. ---  --- Also, it almost completely flaked off over the course of the day. ---  --- I'm giving it two stars because it really is smudge-proof, no sliding or transferring.  I didn't have the dark shadows from smudging but I did have flakes, so I'm still not happy with it. ---  --- This is definitely not worth the pricetag
If you want your child to know the true & Bibical account of Jesus' birth...the shepherds came first! --- An angel announced His birth the shepherds hurried to see Mary, Joseph & baby Jesus. --- They were first on the scene. Some chronicle the kings coming as much as three years later. --- I will return my three sets & order the one with the bells & whistles AND two shepherds!!
These garments were so thin as to not do many of the things one expects of underwear.
Great remake, but where's the fast forward! My kingdom for a fast forward button! --- This was a great game! The cut scenes were a nice touch that helped draw in the player into the story line, but would someone please give me a Fast Forward/Skip button. I understand that the makers of the game want you to get involved and appreciate the storyline, but without a fastforward/skip button, this game game has a limited replay value. I have already played through the game once, and now that I am running through it again, I am going insane! The long cut scenes, and the seemingly endless, "next" clicks were fine the first time, but come on! For a game that has 3 different endings you would figure that the developers would give you a break! ---  --- OK, now that I have said that, lets get back to the review. The character development and use of magical items, while definitely not unique, but they helped flesh out the fight scenes. The combos and skills moves made the game interesting and kept me coming back. While I would have liked to see the graphics slightly change when different equipment was used (swords, helms, etc) the combat and special moves graphics were definitely nice. ---  --- Should you buy? Sure if you like RPG's the game is definitely a buy, but be fore warned...be prepared to read, and read, and read, and click and click and click, before you even get to your first fight scene, and even then expect to much of the same long before you get to do things on your own
I LOVE THIS ITEM /IT HAS SOOTHING MUSIC, SOUNDS AND ANIMATION.  EASY OPERATION,  BABY LOVES IT TOO. ARRIVED QUICKLY AND WELL PACKAGED INSTRUCTIONS ON MANUFACTURERS BOX. THANKS FISHER PRIC
I was again disappointed as this did not make me feel "fresh".  In fact if you mix it with the Dirt in your hair it causes some type of nasty reaction and your hair becomes sticky and gooey - nothing fresh about it. 
This was a great movie.  True the Cube was a trap but it showed the greatest danger was the people inside. ---  --- If you do an indepth look  you will realize  all the names of th epeople inside the cube are names of prisons in 4 different countries, and furthermore  their personalities decribe what the prison is like. ---  --- Kazan (autisic guy) come from  Kazan Prion in Russia  which is a psychiatric prison ---  --- Alderson  comes from  Alderson prison in West Virginia.  This prison commonly uses isolation as a punishment.  Alderson died alone having never ran into anyone. --- Rennes  comes from Rennes Prison In France.  Rennes was kinda the groups mentor.  He showed them 2 tips on how to survive, the  ---  group took these as policy.  Rennes Prison is where most of modern prison policy originated. ---  --- Holloway comes from Holloway Prison in England.  Holloway is a prison for women ---  --- Leaven And Worth come from Leavenworth Prison in Kansas --- Leavenworth has stict rules so does math wicj Leaven is a whiz at. --- Leavenworth was bulit corportely by architects.  Worth was an architect. ---  --- Quentin comes from  San Quentin prison in California.  Both Quentin's are brutal. ---  --- The makes of this movie really did their home work to make those connections. --- The plot was good also,  total strangers  with their memory of how they got there wiped out have to rely on each other to survive
This sharpener is the only one I will use for my colored pencils- and I've tried them all, I think.  It is the only one that will put a short point on them, and I realize this review is similar to the one above. What I don't understand is how everyone else above seems to be getting such a long wear out of them, because I go through one of these every 3 months or so, just about the time the warranty wears out (how strange).  If anyone has a better sharpener that puts the same short-angle point on these pencils, but last longer than three months, I would love to know about it, especially since Staples no longer carries it in my area. 
No where near as easy to use as my old system ,But with trial and error can have a decent amount of control over your Projects.But one interesting thing someone mentioned earlier --- is that regardless of with system you use these labels can alter --- the way DVDs play making them stick and freeze and wondering if its the disks,burner or what..after some experimenting I did --- confirm that it was actually the labels I was having so much fun making...It might be the weight but i think its possibly the way the beam shines through the disc and reflects off the white label backing..Dunno but if you all of a sudden start having problems try a labeling tape or a sharpie
I have tried lots of protein powders.  I get online the low-carb, low-calorie protein powders as I am just trying to put on muscle and it is hard to find one that you can stomach.  I was stuck on Champions Whey (Chocolate) for the past year as the best but I just got my shipment of the Gold Standard - Cookies & Cream and it is AMAZING!  I love this stuff.  I tried it with fat free milk in just a shaker bottle and it was tremendous.  I am going to have this before and after my daily workout, but best yet, rather than binging on any ice cream desires late at night, I am going to get a scoop of fat free frozen vanilla yogurt, put a scoop of this in with some fat free milk and I have my fat free protein shake
Despite some negative reviews I got this seat because I have an 8 mth and 2.5 yr old and my husband is deployed so bathtime can be very challenging. I also have a textured bathtub bottom so I knew a bathring would not work.  ---  --- Well this seat is fantastic - my baby loves to sit in it and tries to grab all of the bath toys so he can chew on them. Also, whenever I get the baby in the toddler wants to jump in too which is so much easier then conjoling an ornery 2 yr old into the tub. Since using the bath seat my infant hasn't scraped his legs on it once like some other reviewers mentioned so not sure what that is about. And although he has tried to climb out a couple of times he is usually content to sit there. Of course even with this seat you can't let such little ones bathe unsupervised anyways so it is fine when he tries to get out - I just put him back and he is happy. Even when I don't bath the two together I put the little one in here - just makes it so much easier then trying to hold him steady (he is such a wiggler - trying to crawl/stand immediately)and having my hands free to scrub him. To clean his bottom I just pull him out clean him and then stick him back in - no problem. To clean the seat I've followed the advice of other posts and again no problem. ---  --- I actually came back here to buy one for my sister but I see that it isn't available right now -boo - I'll have to find it elsewhere.  ---  --- Highly recommend
I was talked into buying this product for minor fine lines. This product that I used for 4 months, showed no signifigant results as well as any other product Ive used by Estee Lauder. Dont waste your money on it. I usually look at it like this. If any cosmetic retailer offer a free gift with purchase it usually needs one to go with it. This product is crap!
The software is easy to install and easy to use.  The "import prior year's return" feature saved time in completing multiple returns .  I completed one return in 10 mins because of this feature. I also discovered the "save as PDF" feature that made it easier to send tax returns to family and friends whom I prepare returns.  I have used tax cut for the last 4 years and it gets better with each year. The premium federal is great for multiple returns with all kinds of schedules
I also found this "Best of" collection to fall very short of the "BEST"! There are clearly MANY other episodes they could have, and SHOULD HAVE used and included to make this truly a "Best of" feature. The few cases they did showcase were by far NOT the scariest! A definite disappointment,...though still a fan!!
I grew up with the original DS.  I also saw the two "spin off" movies: "House of Dark Shadows" and "Night of Dark Shadows."  Needless to say I was extremely excited about the "revival," and I wasn't disappointed.  I felt that Dan Curtis was actually able to improve upon the original, by tightening up the script and employing wonderful actors who fit like the proverbial glove.  The original Barnabus was played by Jonathan Frid who was a Shakespearian trained actor and, Ben Cross is a member of the Royal Shakespearian Theatre in London.  I loved that the revival was able to be more overtly sexual, which as any fan of vampires must know is an essential element of the myth.  And I must say this series lived up to my every expectation.  Dan Curtis took the original and made it completely accessible to older viewers who have such fond memories of the 1963 soap opera.  I looked forward to 3:30 every day after school.  It's too bad that the Gulf War killed it.  Yes it did!  I was there.  After the Sunday, Monday miniseries, that Friday was to air the first "episode."  However it was pre-empted by coverage of the War.  Too, too bad.  I taped it, but unfortunately the last few episodes were accidentally taped over.  I am so glad to know that I can order it now in it's magical entirety.  I'm ordering it right now!  Thank you Amazon!!!!!!! ---  --- If you are a fan of things that go bump in the night, you will LOVE this series!!!!
After purchasing the item in december 2006 it didnt take even a week before the troubles started, it kept freezing after switching it on and took quite long to rebuild the data. At one point, (after two weeks) I lost all my data. Despite downloading the software from the website the problems didnt disappear and i am basically left with a promising player which doesnt even allow me to listen to music without frezing. ---  --- Since then i am struggling with Creative Technical SUpport team as there  --- is advise given to charge my battery or download the software from the website (which both is not been of much help) --- This player hasnt been much of use to me yet and I deeply regret having paid 360 USD.  ---  --- I gave it 2 stars because I was able to watch 2 movies while waiting at the airport and travelling, this was quite a pleasure
Very limited photo touch up. When it comes time to burn you might as well have customer service on the phone. Pretty much a total piece of crap!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
We are using this bather for our son who is one month old. What we like most about this bather is that the water drains away from the baby.  The fabric is also very soft, quick drying, and removable for machine washing.  The model we have does include straps that can be adjusted around the baby's waist.  To keep him warm, we pour cupfuls of warm water on him throughout his bath.  Since we don't fill up the tub with water, slippage has not been a problem
This album is simply one of the coolest things around, and when I listened to it, it inspired me to a similar project using the same 'weaving and zoning from place to place' kind of method. What this basically is, are field recordings of various different indigenous and mainstream musics from mostly Indian/Middle Eastern/Oriental festivals; they are then mixed together nicely into one flowing peice. You get Indian gamelan, mussette accordion, vocal choruses, foreign tongue talking, and psychadelic bagpipes all in one 33 minute track, and then some. It's very trippy, and it hints at some kind of endless dream where we flow from place to place without reason. Get this for your own good
I have burned over 100 of these in the past 6 months, I have only had 1 burn badly.  Haven't found a dvd player yet that they won't play in
These are all short stories, some very short; that's what he wrote. I remember reading a number of these (the science fiction ones mostly) in translation years ago. Rereading them now in the context of all his other work was really very interesting. As a collection of all his fictions, some of the items are a bit repetitive; the variations on the "knife fight" theme for instance. But the range of his imagination is fascinating, particularly in his thoughts about reality vs imagination and layers of reality and identity: a lot of it presages the information-based world of today, which sometimes seems to have left hard reality behind. ---  --- Perhaps the link to the internet is one reason Borges seems to have a bit of a following these days among technophiles. Is not the web exactly Borges' "Book of Sand" - a place that absorbs us with fascinating and unique pages of information, but when we turn to find them again, we never can? And how long will it be before an imagined "Orbis Tertius" engulfs entities such as the wikipedia we think we can rely on (one might suggest it's already happened - look up Tatooine, for instance...) What exactly is information when it's just a bunch of ones and zeros - everything's already been written in the "Library of Babel" after all! ---  --- The other fascinating thread to me was the influence of Arabic and Muslim themes; I'd never caught that before, but this collection includes a number of stories with an Arab perspective. Perhaps this is a well-known part of Spanish heritage; in any case, it was certainly interesting getting to know Borges through this collection, from the knife fights to the Arabian courts to the Immortals - not everything was great, but enough great stuff to be really worth spending some time with
I bought this after fidning my 2nd child who is 4 months old caught under the headboard bumper that came with his bedding.  This is my 2nd child & I have never been told of this danger.  I highly recommend this bumper.  It comes in 2 pieces, the shorter one goes across the front railing that you move up & down, the longer piece goes from the last slat on the headboard to the last slat on the footboard.  There are only 2 gaps which are where the handles for the railing are.  I was also able to weave a few places along the sides to make sure he couldnt get underneath.  I love that it's wide so that it reaches down to the mattress, it velcros at each end across both the top & bottom for a tight fit, it will collapse if an older baby tries to step on it but is still very tight & that it's very breathable but still has a little cushion to it. --- I just wish that I had known of the danger of traditional crib bumpers.  Thankfully I heard my son screaming when I did.  HIGHLY RECOMEND THIS PRODUCT, or one like it to avoid suffocation hazard from stuffed bumpers
These are not the original theatrical realeases. In addition to the changes made in the special edition versions of the films, American Cinematographer noted in their review of the DVD release that they had gone so far as to change the color-timing of the transfer so that the color scheme more closely resembled the more recent prequels. Though they are an impressive technical achievement, I'll be buying the academy award winning films that I saw when I was younger
I got this accessory with my Door Gym and I like it.  But, when they say this is an "efficient" accessory - they mean it.  It simply rests on the narrower neutral grip posts of the Door Gym.  The Door Gym has multiple grip areas, but two of them are perpendicular to the rest of the bar for narrow neutral grip chin ups.  The Broad reach bar is wide with downward grips (like lat pull down bar in a gym).   ---  --- Anyway, this works fine if you have the faith to try it the first time and prove to yourself it won't roll off because your body weight has it pinned on the posts. It has foam covering that adheres to the foam on the Door Gym posts. It will not roll easily, but it does a little. I think it is safe for adults who understand how to use it.  Do not give it to kids younger than about 15 (in my estimation) because some of them are too likely to play with, or misuse, it and get hurt. ---  --- Even though this thing works and does what you want a broad bar to let you do, I deducted a point in the rating because I don't think  they were up front in explaining exactly what it is and is not
Well, it worked out great because they were bought for a friend who now resides in California but is originally from New York. ---  --- They arrived in a timely fashion and they were in good condition and enjoyed by all. ---  --- In fact I would order them again.
I received one of these meals after Hurricane Rita. They were being handed out by first responders to people in the area before our utilities were restored. Excellent product. I wanted more so I could stock up in case of another disaster or emergency. I found their website and discovered that they were not for sale over the internet. I was very disappointed...until today. I went back to their website and saw that the meals are now available from amazon! This is great news! I suggest that everyone stock up on these meals in case of emergencies. They really come in handy.
I received my new shoes this afternoon and took a test run. I didn't really buy this a3 for its "functionality" but rather the look. I thought the honey comb and the color combination look kinda cool. However, I DID NOT at all feel being "propelled through every foot", and the so called a3 cushion heels felt very stiff. I even poked it with my hand, oh man it's hard. I also tried jumping up and down to try to feel the bounciness, but all I did feel was my feet stomping hard onto the cement.  --- BTW, if your feet are wide and flat like mine, it's going to be very uncomfortable when walking with these shoes.   ---  --- *** UPdate *** November 15, 2006 --- It's been 2 months since I've been wearing these shoes, and I've changed my opinion them. Once you get use to the a3 sequence, they are actually quite comfortable. The honeycombs under the heels do make every step a little bouncier now. Maybe it takes time to soften up the material and make them more flexible
I saw this THAI horror film about 3 years ago. I have to say this is the best supernatural thriller made from Thailand, and I have seen a fair share of them(Nang nak, the sisters, mae nak, art of the devil series). ---  --- The film focuses on Tun and his girlfriend Jane. Tun, a photographer reunites with his old friends. On the way home, they accidentally hit a girl with their car and from then on, Tun sees ghostly apparitions whenever he takes pictures or whenever he tries to develop them.  Ok, I am not spoiling anything, the story is more complex than it sounds. Tun and his friends have a past that catches up to them, with Jane caught in the middle. As usual, there is a vengeful spirit going around killing people. "Shutter" refers to his camera and what it represents. "Sometimes the dead cannot let go of their loved ones.." I'm stopping here, I don't want to give out anymore. ---  --- The plot is not that complex, but believe me when I say, the film is well-made. It does a great job of putting things together, each shocking scene is linked to the past and the present. I didn't see any scene wasted and it has that very atmospheric, creepy feel to it.  Also, there is a scene in the movie that Tun and Jane looked at ACTUAL photos of ghostly apparitions in a polaroid.  ---  --- Honestly, this film has some great scenes that can make the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end the very first time you watch it and the "shock ending" has the greatest twist of any horror flick I've seen! I've seen a lot of horror films, only THE EXORCIST and THE OMEN ever scared/creeped me out, and SHUTTER came very close. My female friends were scared out of their wits when they saw it at my place. ---  --- Since I haven't seen the TARTAN release and I only own the region-3 DTS-ES rlease from PanMedia (Hong Kong)but Tartan usually uses the same transfers from either the HONG KONG or KOREAN versions. The video is sufficient, with some dark and bright contrast. It is not free of grain but it does add to the atmospheric feel. the DTS soundtrack is great though, very crisp and loud. The english subtitles are excellent, the Thai language track is the only way to watch as it was meant to be seen. ---  --- A DEFINITE must-see if you are a fan of ASIAN HORROR or horror films in general. It rivals RINGU, ONE MISSED CALL and the original JU-ON 1 and 2. --- FOUR AND 1/2 STARS!
There's nothing unique about this text - all the topics & discussions have been well covered in other basic textbooks on Corporate Finance, Mergers etc....  ---  --- The discussions lack depth. The whole concept of Corporate Strategy has been miscontrued by the authors.... The link between this and Financial Markets is very ambiguous & blur! ---  --- FYI I'm a businessman & hold an MBA in Finance from an international university
It has made my bookkeeping for my small business soooo easy. Invoices in a flash,keep track of your expenses so easily. This program was the best investment and tax deductible! Very easy not complicated!
Simply THE tool for getting your business put together.  It's able to do just about everything you'd ever want to do!!
This isn't a product thats going to get you laid after she sniffs it a couple of times. It's starts the chat and dialog.   What it does do is start the conversation and keep you the their target. M-11 kicks up the yackity yak in her with you being the focus. I;ve tried a few of them including that 90 dollar rip off thats advertised in Popular Science, and this is  product works just fine. Give it a go guys. It gets you past that awkward dork moment when you are trying to talk about somthing other that what Starbucks you hang at. Its not a sex pill so forget it. But, it will open up the road you need to walk down to get to the garden of eden or whatever. So don't be a little whimp. Be a man and give it a go. Its a way to the women you want via the mental route. Yes, you have to think. It will work for you so do it
THIS PREVIEW HAS SPOILERS OF THE GAME PLEASE DON T READ IT IF YOU DIDN T PLAY IT! ---  --- I played Xenogears and when i saw Xenosaga Episode was kinda short compare xenogears in battle system but was ok because xenosaga was like an "introduction". ---  --- OK improvements: --- Gameplay was Longer than Episode 1 (I ended Episode 1 with everything in 42 hours) in change Ep2 (88+). --- Sidequest is like a plus if you want it to do it if you don t you can end the game anyways. --- The Idea of Epiloge after you finish the game was very cool because you could kill special bosses and get better and kill the final boss overkilled and stuff like that. --- Chaos Jr Momo Shion & Kosmos Looking was improved they looked more grow up. --- Battle system to put them up or down depending who you were using or fighting as well double Tech attacks --- All Characters were able to use all magic skills as long you buy them with your skillpoints and making able with the sidequests. --- Momo Bow was a very nice improvement and now she can be a very good Damage Dealer --- Recover Mp while stock was a good idea as well to use ep freely without any trouble. --- People complain because history was focus in Jr and URTVs but the title says itself (Jenseits von Gut und Bse) means "Beyond Good and Evil" wich means "Rubedo worring for the ladies in danger and his Red Dragon mode wich makes him go out of control (possible reason of Sakura Death), Albedo and his obssesive love for rubedo but at the same time to kill him as well, Nigredo wich refused to do a mission (involved with Rubedo) and killed his own father but he plays as good person at the moment as albedo said "Giving life from 1 hand and delivering death from the other". --- Honestly second episode history role was more development than first one because wasn t an introduction and we were starting to know how things were going... ---  ---  --- What they did wrong: --- I don t see how they could think throw away the tech attacks was going to be a good idea... --- Good Thing they added the tech attacks & special attacks in ep 3  --- You had to do stock a lot of times to make a good combo between characters(wich made battles kinda boring) --- Music in battle was kinda boring compare to Ep 1 --- Voices of Chaos(sounded boring...) Kos-Mos (like Fake silly girl trying to play as a robot) Shion (Pushing and like "I m better than you") Momo (Very Annoying) sad thing is my main team is Chaos Kosmos & Momo thats why i got sad for that voice changes but they said they refix their voices as episode 1 in the third and last episode. --- Ep 1 has almost 8 hours of movies Ep 2 4:30hours (i guess for the complains of the long movies) --- I still don t get it movies give more motion of the storyrole of the game wich is most of the attractive things Xenosaga has over most of the games. In Episode 3 is 4hours of full motion movies but plus the speak texts with faces included while characters move and do stuff like Valkyrie Profile --- They cut completly the close up when they cast spells or hit lights and stuff most of the time you see characters back all the way while you are fighting. (they fix that in ep3) ---  --- In Resume as everyone know Episode 2 had bad things but as well good things (as every game) no they shouldn t did it bad when they noticed the things people like of the game itself. Good thing is they fixed most of the bad stuff of Episode 2 to Episode 3. Battle system soundtrack and characters voices all is better only thing i didn t like of episode 3 battle mode is they make it appear as an average rpg system (attack, ether, tech, special tech, and others) so forget the 4 combinations to make a tech attacks & ethers cost "ep(cp)" special attacks cost boosts. i wonder if attack will give some "ep(cp)" later. Even with all this i recommend you to buy it before you get episode 3 because you will be losing a lot of storyline if you don t and more now they cost 20 dollars each (or less) ---  --- Atte: --- Roy_Master
Horror master Arthur Machen's crowning achievement, a still shocking compendium of interwoven short horror tales.   In late 19th century London, a scientist and an unpublished writer join forces as amateur detectives in an attempt to solve a minor but puzzling mystery which ultimately leads to the discovery of a truly diabolical conspiracy.  In the course of their investigations, the two men find themselves repeatedly surrendering their attention to a series of seemingly outlandish tales spun by an assortment of eccentric story tellers.  The stories, which all deal with imposture of some kind, are only tangentially related to each other, yet offer the somewhat bumbling sleuths important clues to the mystery at hand.  Machen builds suspense slowly and methodically, masterfully leading the reader on to a completely unexpected, gruesome climax.  Comical, tragic, sophisticated, violent, horrific, and even downright disgusting, THE THREE IMPOSTORS is a classic horror novel of sly deception and wit.     ---  --- The 1995 Everyman paperback is the only critical edition of this remarkably rich book released to date, offering a scholarly introduction (by editor David Trotter) that carefully details Machen's main influences (chiefly Robert Louis Stevenson) and themes (imposture of various kinds, also derived from Stevenson).  A short text summary nicely encapsulates the narrative's various twists and turns.  Finally, a section entitled "Machen and His Critics" provides a welcome offering of mostly contemporaneous critical responses to this remarkable book; while many of these reviews were laudatory, quite a few passionately outraged quotes reveal just how shocking THE THREE IMPOSTORS must truly have been in its time
The Speck rubber case is the best case i've found for my Blackberry 7290.  That being said, it's not ideal and i'd make a few changes. ---  --- Pros -- protects case well; no screen scratches; minimizes accidental keystrokes while in your bag; no need to use the belt clip (most women prefer purses/totebags to belt clips!); and i love the fact that you can easily see whether you have new messages (no need to take it out of the case in addition to taking it out of your purse or totebag).  ---  --- Cons -- clear case collects dirt; screen cover is slightly opaque and requires greater use of the backlight; screen cover doesn't fit squarely into the rubber case; and screen cover gets scratches on it, making the screen harder to read.   ---  --- I get a lot of compliments on this case, it's different enough to be noticed, and people are envious of my ability to quickly check for messages without having to fumble with opening and closing the case.  However, because of the cons, I suspect i'll need to replace this case more than once a year.  But i like it enough that i'll pay the $35 to do so.  Maybe the next version will have some improvements.  In the meantime, i feel like i'm getting my money's worth out of it.
Tunisian Anouar Brahem's "Le Voyage de Sahar" finds him in the same company- pianist Francis Courturier and accordionist Jean-Louis Martinier- as 2002's highly acclaimed "Le pas du chat noir." --- Having toured in support of that CD, the trio developed into a true group, something that Brahem accentuates to great effect on this program of new compositions and three favorites that are recast with the new ensemble. --- With "Voyage" Brahem continues a trend of creating music that is not as overtly "jazzy" as some of his earlier outings. --- Nonetheless, he remains a master a crafting deliciously vivid, richly evocative compositions that distill Arabic music and European jazz sensibilities with a warm, sonorous chamber music vibe. --- Among the ports of call on this "Voyage" are "Zarabanda," whose elegant lope recalls the French Riviera. --- Elsewhere the title track exudes mysticism tempered with intrigue, while "Cordoba" and "Ete Andalous" are meditative pieces with a decidedly cinematic scope.  The gentle bounce of "Nuba" and introspection of "Les Jardins de Ziryab" both include uncredited but effective passages of voice. --- Rarely do you hear music this gorgeous
My son (7) used a gift certificate to purchase this game for his birthday. It came with 4 dics that we downloaded correctly but the game would not play. We kept getting an error message that our graphics were not sufficient.  We don't do much PC gaming, but we have a fairly new Dell laptop computer that we assumed was sufficient. If the item description had been more advising that certain requirements would prevent the game from working -- we wouldn't have wasted his time.  We have yet to receive credit for this item. A HUGE HASSLE!!  We'll stick to the PS2 games from now on.
Anime Studio 5 is surprisingly powerful. Fairly easy to get started with and appears to have a lot of power waiting to be exploited.
I used Aveeno moisturizer and thought I would try something new.  I have eczema on my face (around my eyes, nose and mouth) in the winter and have no signs of it after a few days.  My skin is very sensitive, and have experienced burning with other products, but not this one.  I sinks in quickly and is not greasy feeling or heavy, yet strong enough to tackle dry skin.  I highly recommend it
These cookes are so good.  I have tried many that look similar, but none are as good as these, too bad most stores have stopped carrying them
This is the best outdoor cooking item I have ever used.  It has very high BTU's and cooks very quickly.  When using it as a wok it takes the grease out of the kitchen that used to linger for days.  We cook all greasy foods outdoors it is extremely fast and the food comes excellent. We use it more than out BBQ.
No need to say more, these f@gs are just making lousy punk pop for the teenage girls and mtv watching kids who think they're quite rebel with listening to this kind of sheit, and these suckers do it just for the money like green day or blink 182. There just have to be some stuff like this to fill all the pop and mtv charts
AWESOME!!! This product is wonderful. Take if from me I have been detailing for years and this exceeded my expectations. To be applied over any wax or sealant will not haze when applied and is extremely easy to buff off. Requires minimal effort at all it's like running a microfiber towel over your car it's that easy. I found that it works the best when applied over Liquid Glass which is a polish that carries a lifetime warranty on their product. You can find Liquid Glass at your nearest automotive store or at a local Autozone. I will keep on buying this product as long as they make it. Mothers recommends using their Reflections carnauba wax before the top coat which I am sure is great I have yet to do this since I love the Liquid Glass so much. The appearance of your car will change dramatically especially if you have a dark car. I recommend before you apply this product make sure that the vehicle has been clayed to remove any contaminates before applying the topcoat. Hope this review has helped you in deciding whether this is a great product or not.
I am a BR5-49 aficionado from the early days at Robert's when the band played for tips and usually played requests until 2am with little or no breaks.  Admittedly, I long for those days as much as I long for stirrups in Major League Baseball.  So I'm nostalgic, "IT'S A FREE COUNTRY."  It is also legal for a band to evolve and morph in any which way it feels.  Yet, whenever I read a review in some fishwrap publication that states that a band has "matured," I can do nothing but cringe.  Here's the flowchart:  Band starts out - Band plays hard - Band gets cult following - Band gets reputation - Band strikes out on road - Band gets contract - Band gets a little more pub. - Band gets contract with bigger label - Band gets new management supplied by label - Band gets "coached" in next recording - Band changes faces along the way - Band changes label again - Band gets new direction from new label - Band fights for identity - Band produces new "mature" album - Band gets lost as cult finds new local acts beginning this process. --- Gee, I sure hope this isn't how the end of BR5-49 comes about, but enough of the doom and gloom of impending implosion.  This record is OK.  Of course, I realize that any band can't just re-hash the same 'ol stuff on every album, but part of what got these guys so much early attention was the raw exhuberance they displayed both live and on the vinyl.  One part of this was their ability to do cover songs usually better than the originals, and a simple taste of this is what I sorely miss in the last few recordings.  This band live used to be a wild, jittery, moving organism on stage, and although they are still a solid live show (saw them on the last tour at Poor David's Pub in Dallas), something has settled down. Chuck is a great talent, but an early appeal of the band was the vocal volley of Chuck and Gary Bennett. Ok, I'll go cry me a river, but dammit, just go listen to the Big Backyard Beat Show one more time.  Mature?  I just don't want to grow up that bad
The product shipped immediately, a new Dell AC Adapter from Cable4Less. I am extremely happy with the company and the charger's performance as I needed a second one so I would not have to keep plugging in and out my primary charger. I didn't think I could get such a good deal on a real Dell product
This is the candy our two boys ask for the most. And their friends (and their parents) love them, too.  We gave them out for Halloween and had rave reviews back from neighbors. It's great to be able to give out candy to trick or treaters and to guests that we know won't hurt anyone (no peanuts, no corn, no artificial anything). Just great taste!  Rock on, Yummy Earth.
I just wanted to let all other bigger busted women know to NOT buy this product. It is made for smaller busted women in mind. There is no support and barely any coverage for bigger busted woman. It was a trial on my part but I hope by writing this it will help other women avoid making the same mistake. Stick with the strapless bras ladies!
Ehhhhh. What is this? This is one very stupid movie. How do I get a refund
Having read most of Grisham's books, I've saved a few of his "best" for last.  While it wasn't a 5 star book like I'd hoped, it certainly was one of his better books with a lot of detail and of course the plot was an interesting one. ---  --- Having saw the movie years ago, I had a good idea of what the book was about:  Two Supreme Court Justices are killed, a law school student, along with many other people become curious and try to figure out "who dun it"...only, she writes a brief and hits the nail on the head, and when the wrong people find out, she's on the run for her life! ---  --- I enjoyed the book mostly because it was fast-paced, and had a lot of detail.  So much detail and characters, I had a bit of a struggle to keep up!  Of course it was suspenseful and the characters, especially of Darby, the law school student and the reporter who starts to help her uncover the truth.  Good read
This bar is larger that most nutrition or meal replacement bars - that much is true. What is also true is that is contains more fat.  ---  --- What you will notice with the first bite, is that the bar seems somehow "inflated". There is an emptiness to consistency of the bar. You are not getting the quality nutrition you would get from a Myoplex or Apex bar. Stick with those brands for pure nutrition and FAR BETTER TASTE.  ---  --- These METRX bars leave you feeling as though you've eaten something that was bad for you - like after you eat a dessert, yet these will not be mistaken for desserts
This jacket is soft and almost luxurious.  I am greatly disappointed that when hanging the hoodie by the hood, it split and tore under its own weight!!!!  I think this says it all, no?  I would, unfortunately, not buy and American Apparel item again.  They are usually sized WAY too small and now I see the quality just isn't there.  Greener pastures.....
There's a reason the price on this is low ... because it's a worthless piece of merchandise.  I gave mine to good will two days after it came.
great for travel to protect your passport and hold anything else you might want.  looks great as well
Pro --- ---  --- * Compact enough to fit into a jacket pocket, yet opens to a comfortable working size with full-sized keys, including a number row.  --- For those who do serious number entry to spreadsheets, this is decidedly a deal-maker over the Stowaway keyboard which requires alt-key combinations to access numbers and symbols. The full-size keys require no revamping of typing habits as does the miniaturized key spacing on the Freedom Keyboard. --- To my knowledge, there is no other folding bluetooth keyboard on the market at the time of this writing which has *both* full-size keys *and* a number/symbol row. ---  --- * The bluetooth connection is clean, lag free, and accurate.  ---  --- Con --- ---  --- * The software for gaining a connection is a bit cumbersome, requiring entry of a checkmark into a box with each use, and then an access code on a second screen with each battery replacement (see below). ---  --- * Flimsy Locking Mechanism / Not Usable on a Lap.  ---  --- The manual tells us that a lock is provided to keep the opened keyboard flat "while on your lap or on a non-flat surface". --- This "lock" is a single piece of wire about the thickness of an undone paperclip, which travels 7/8" along the top of the board from the left half into the right. --- Even when locked, the keyboard doesn't lay flat, and with the center of the board hovering over the empty chasm between the user's legs, held in place only by one thin piece of wire, the two halves bend to an increasingly exaggerated "V" shape after any amount of light-handed typing.  --- HP could have saved themselves the trouble of this useless bit of cosmetics. A user must find a solid flat surface to type on, such as a book. And of course, when sitting on a flat surface, the lock isn't needed. ---   --- * The manual correctly tells us that one reason to use a wireless keyboard is to "enjoy the convenience of a wireless bluetooth connection up to 7 meters away from your...PocketPC". Unfortunately, the designers ignored this consideration when conceiving the non-removable cradle. --- A quick look at the Freedom Keyboard's pull-out cradle offers HP a lesson in how to do it right. ---   --- * The keyboard ships with no case, as do most other portable keyboards with non-rugged exteriors. The attractive brushed metalic exterior of the folded case thereby scratches easily in a jacket pocket containing loose change or a set of keys. ---  --- * It doesn't turn off. ---  ---  --- Yes, you read that last bullet correctly: You can't turn this thing off. There's no power switch.  ---  --- The button in the upper right corner of the keyboard is to establish and disengage the wireless connection between the software and the handheld; it's not a power switch. ---  --- What this means is, even when folded and not in use, even when appearing to be dormant, and even when the software shows that there's no bluetooth connection,  the keyboard is still eating your batteries.  ---  --- The automatic "sleep mode" simply disables the wireless connection; it does not power down the keyboard. --- Two weeks after putting in a fresh set of batteries and not using the keyboard, you'll return to find them dead. Not the coolest way to walk into a meeting full of executives expecting you to take notes. ---  --- The only way to power down the keyboard is to open the battery cover and remove the batteries. The battery cover, need I add, breaks easilly. ---  --- Sound unbelievable? Go to the major websites dedicated to PocketPCs, and do a search of their forums using the keywords "bluetooth keyboard". This is not a case of a know-nothing customer who needs to read the manual. The manual, such as it is, makes no mention of an absent power switch. ---  ---  --- For the mobile user then, in addition to the keyboard itself, one need also travel with something stable to rest the board on, to have something to prop the handheld against if distance is desired, to carry the batteries separately, and to re-enter the access key into the software after reinserting those  batteries. --- Although the folded board will fit easily into a jacket pocket, the additional loose paraphernalia negates any usefulness of this mobile keyboard for the mobile user.  --- Add to that the marred exterior and bent lock after minimal use, the HP iPaq keyboard is worth perhaps 1/3 it's $100 retail price, and then only if a consumer absolutely requires the full-size keys and number row. ---  ---  --- How HP ever expected anyone to sit still for this kind of idiocy eludes me. --- All potential buyers of iPaq handhelds should take this keyboard as a reflection of what, if any, emphasis HP places on quality of design and the integrity of iPaq name.  --- It reflects also the degree of respect HP has for the intelligence of their customers. One might easily forgive a negative design attribute like the non-removable cradle, or the parsimony of not including a case. One might even forgive the useless locking mechanism. --- But when HP is either too dumb to include an on/off switch, or they expect us to be so dumb to not notice or care, then I must seriously doubt the usefulness of other products bearing the iPaq name.  --- If HP is content to offer this marginally useful toy to consumers for $100, then I cannot believe enough magic exists in the world to suddenly make them sharp enough to produce a sophisticated device like a PocketPC for $300-400.  --- My next handheld upgrade, I'll probably stay with Fujitsu-Siemens Loox (I currently use a Loox720, a truly excellent PPC), or maybe go with a Dell Axim. I won't even consider an iPaq.  ---  --- The HP Bluetooth keyboard is quite simply an offense to any consumer with even the vaguest and most forgiving sense of quality.  --- Those at HP responsible for protecting public perception of the iPaq brand name should be truly ashamed of themselves.
My wife has a problem with earrings because she needs a small prong. I ordered her other earrings but I had to return them because they hurt her ears. These were a nice change because she can wear them without the pain. Plus she loves them
When we got our changing table from a friend who no longer needed it... They gave us the Diaper Depot as well. I love how it puts everything at an arms reach without clutting the changing table. It has lasted two kids before the one it's on now, so a total of three babies. I guess like anything if it's taken care of properly it won't break
The service from iGourmet is impeccable ---  --- Everything arrived in perfect condition i.e. ripe (and therefore "stinky" just like it should be!!) ---  --- The Styrofoam packaging was the perfect vessel for delivery; the cheese arrived "alive" from not being over chilled. ---  --- I have not had cheese of this quality outside France, and this is the first time I have found "perfect" cheese in the US. ---  --- If you like top quality "stinky" cheese this is for you........
I bought this grill basket for my husband for Father's Day.  According to the description, it had everything we were looking for: detachable handle, separate sections for separate cooking, grilled veggies won't fall through, etc.  Unfortunately, the basket is so poorly made that the baskets don't open (without a crowbar!) and the handle neither attaches or detatches without a whole lot of muscle.  My husband had to get out his tools and try to rebend the whole thing to get it to function.  What an over-priced dissappointment
This gate is almost totally useless -- unless your doorways and walls are all /perfectly/ plumb and square AND happen to fit the arbitrary slots where the gate will allow you to engage the lock, that is... 
Ok I picked up a corded Vidal Sassoon hairclipper at Target. The thing was so absolutely horrible that I had to come to Amazon to vent about it. The blades seemed blunt, if not nonexistent. It would only cut little tufts of hair, and the hair had to be taut, literally held by my fingers. It literally tried to rip the hair out of my head. My follicles still hurt from the hour or so I spent trying to shave my head with this terrible clipper. Most of the hair I actually successfully removed, was due to scissors. Lubrication and blade adjustment with the screwdriver had no effect--the blades weren't *stuck*, they just *suck.* ---  --- I don't care how much money Vidal Sassoon spends trying to portray themselves as the trendy cutting edge in fashion maintenance--judging from this horrible experience, they really, really do not know how to make a decent hairclipper. I have shaved my head plenty of times over the last few decades, and I have seen some bad clippers, but never have I experienced a clipper that was so bad that it would probably be bested by a haircut given by a sharpened stone instead.
This DVD along with her 2 international albums "Pure" and "Odyssey" are best stress reduction kits available in the market. Slip this in a DVD player and in a matter of minutes stress level, heart rate, and blood pressure all three are down and life if manageable again.
This pillow is the best! After sleeping with it the first night, I new I couldn't be without it.  My husband bought it for me and I am so thankful.  I left it at my mother's house one night and I could not sleep, I keep waking up.  The night after getting it back I slept like a baby again.  If you are having trouble sleeping you have to buy this!  Its very soft, and you can take the cover off to wash it
This lens is fairly inexpensive and the reason for that is while it definitely lets you get really close and the image is definitely larger than without it, the fact is the FZ7 and the FZ30 macro settings are already so good that the image is perhaps 15% or so bigger than without it.  If I can I'll post a couple flower images to permit comparison with and without the lens. The camera I have is a FZ7.  Because I want as large an image as possible of my focus I am very happy
Forgive me for the rhyme, but the sentiment is true.  This product is rich, but at the same time light.  After opening the jar, I loved the way the Hair Honey smelled, it has a sweet aroma but I didn't detect the "cirtus" smell in the product description.  I am only sorry I didn't get the larger size. 
I've tried many a serum, potion, lotion, cream... every over the counter fit-it on the market and none have had the wonderful effect that this has had!  I know, Iknow... there are those out there who say the effect is fleeting, but I've yet to see it
i though i hated yu-gi-oh because mostly everyone i played against summoned like a dark magician without even sacrificing  weird right :( so instead i bought the computer yugi the destiny 2 learn how 2 play im a very good duelist now  because i have 2 god cards obelisk and shining dragon so i bought this deck and i found this deck was unstoppable
Came quickly and was exactly as offered. I am completly satisfie
This was a book that finally answered my wife's questions.  She is a theologian (main stream, liberal.  Evolution is OK) and deals with science and religion frequently.  She kept asking me of my biochemical research "is it predictive?".  What she was asking was from my studies in protein structure could I predict the Taj Mahal?  I mumbled a great deal during those conversations.   ---  --- In this book Mayr give voice and coherence to the chaos that is biology.  It is not the science of physics, where one equation rules all.  Choices, and accidents happen, and they shape future development.  That is who we are. ---  --- I recommend this book to anyone really interested in what biology is, and what is can say about how it has arrived in this place and time.   ---  --- duke ou
I like Japanese films, and really wanted to like this one. However I must say there are a lot of confusing parts to the plot. Now I have read this is going to be part of a trilogy one day. If that is true I might give it a higher rating. As of now however, there are just a lot of things that don't make sense
I bought this stroller after much research and deliberation.  It is comfortable for my [...]as well as my [...]daughter.  It handles wonderfully. It folds pretty well too.  The front swivel wheel makes a huge difference with manuverability and the adjustable handle bar is a great feature. I am tall and it helps to have the handle where I need it.   I have used this for both walking, shopping and jogging and think it is perfect!  From purchase to delivery it took maybe 5 days.  I am extremely happy with all aspects of this purchase.  I love this stroller!
I use the Dusty Pink, and I have never ever used a blush that looks so natural, and makes my skin glow so healthy.  With or without the mineral foundation from Youngblood; just lovely.  Highly recommended
Been using the BAR388HGA-BK for about a month, now.  Appears to be very accurate for both temp and humidity.  Really helps in calibrating our whole house humidifier (who's hygrometer is way off).  Automatic atomic clock is cool, too.  Highly recommend
I have owned Wild Orchid for quite a few years and from the beginning thought it was a bit out there. Some of it doesn't fit, some of it doesn't make sense and some of it is just plain dumb. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because I like Mickey Rourke. Even though he does look at bit beat up in this movie and kind of scary looking at first with the slicked down hair he is practically oozing sex. Carre Otis's character, Emily, seems a bit aloof and childlike. She is bombarded by scenes of people having sex in an abandoned building, watching 2 people have sex in a limo. Wheeler (Mickey Rourke) almost seems to enjoy watching Emily squirm a bit. Wheeler is sort of detached, but wanting someone he can trust. Its tough to make sense of this movie because honestly the best part is the end. Now I have the unrated version so it shows more than the R-rating (for a movie like this one - unrated or NC-17 is the way to go)-the part where Wheeler and Emily make love finally. It is very arousing to say the least. I must give it to Zalman King. He knows how far to go to where the movie gets into your mind, but yet he doesn't go for the gratuitous sex. I suggest Delta of Venus, which is another Zalman King experience
These shoes are beautiful and comfortable.  I wore them at a New Year's Eve wedding... danced all night with NO sore feet!  This is my third pair of Carlos shoes, LOVE THEM
If you are buying this set for a beginner (i mean JUST STARTED PLAYING) then fine, this set DOES NOT come with the cymbals and even if it did come with the hi-hats, crash cymbal, and ride cymbal, they would be terrible sounding. If you have been playing for a few years dont get this set, this set really is only meant for kids and early beginners, because I'm 14 and have been playing for 4 years, and i'm still a beginner and i would not buy this set, so think it ove
Based on Bizet's tragic Spanish opera, this was Rita Hayworth's first film made by her production company, Beckworth (derived from her screen surname and from the name of her daughter, Rebecca). She decided on her close friend and favorite leading man, Glenn Ford, as Don Jose to her Carmen. The results are far better than some reviews would have you believe. ---  --- The glorious, lush Techincolor is fabulous (studio-bound as most of the sets may be), while Hayworth's unforgettable screen presence, dancing and bewitching beauty, and the heat generated between her and Ford makes this movie memorable. The sequence in which she describes what virtues a lover should have (complete with putting her finger to his lips) sparkles with sensual static. Granted, Ford looks stiff and ill at ease in his uniform (after he sheds his soldier garb and dons his "bandit clothing", he appears much more relaxed). ---  --- If it is deemed worthy enough to be released as part of the Columbia Classics collection, so should "Affair In Trinidad", another Hayworth/Ford collaboration. ---  --- It's just great to look at, flaws aside. If you adore Rita and Glenn, even in a tempestuous, volatile romance, this movie will provide that for you. ---  --- Was there ever a more enticing, tempestous gypsy with so many men in her life but only one true and ultimately tragic love?  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  
I guess this is a good buy, especially when Corporate Vice President and Chief XNA Architect of Microsoft says so.  I just thought it was interesting when J Allard gave a review of this product on Amazon.co
Unlike other classical-crossover artists minus Emma Shapplin, I believe Sarah Brightman works for art, not for money, or fame, or show off. Like what she said in an interview, she sees music a a whole--music is to be enjoyed (and categorization should never get in the way). That's apparent from this very endearing album La Luna. ---  --- I think this album is as a whole better than any song in it although my favourites are still the mystical Figlio Perduto, the dreamy Serenade/How Fair this Place, the gloomy Gloomy Sunday, and the sweet La Luna.  ---  --- I read what a reviewer said about how any other sopranos could sing better than Sarah on La Luna/Song to the Moon. I think that's not true, at all. Just because the singing isn't wagnerish, it doesn't mean it's easy or lacking in technique or whatever he said. I think it's easier to just sing full out operatic like, say, Renee Fleming than singing with so much passion and being lilting without losing any of the voice's qualities (laid back with 'THAT' voice at the beginning and successively powerful at the end). And, duh, she sings classical properly, ffs. --- And tell me a name of a soprano who could sing How Fair this Place with such grace, without sounding like a screeching steel can. --- I've also listened to many other versions of Gloomy Sunday. Billie's is weird. Sarah McLachlan's is out of context. Sinead o' Connors' is shabby although the intelligence behind the singing is fine. Only Sarah Brightman's and Bjork's versions are best for my ears. --- I have introduced her music (from Phantom of the Opera to Dive to Timeless to Harem) to many people, and apparently they enjoy them very much! There is this radio that's a favourite of us where Gloomy Sunday and Time To Say Goodbye are played as much as Bon Jovi's It's My Live and Sophie Ellis Bextor's Take Me Home and Offspring's Pretty Fly. They're good music and enjoyable. ---  --- Albeit I also like many other sopranos. I like Lucia Popp's interpretation of Richard Strauss' lieders, Christa Ludwig's of Schubert's, Natalie Dessay, Kiri te Kanawa, etc. :
Not only was this difficult to set up (even a generally polite but sadly ill-informed technical helper from Belkin was baffled regarding the simplest steps and keyphrases) but once I finally managed to get it to work (by simply as a last resort resetting the router with a paper clip) it had practically no range whatsoever; in fact, my MacBook Pro placed within 2 inches of the router itself only received a 75% signal, and once the threshold of the room was crossed, the signal disappeared altogether. A free four-year old Linksys router which I received with my Earthlink "home networking" package (and which this Belkin was supposed to replace) always worked with a full signal everywhere in the house and rarely failed, and Linksys is supposed to be notoriously Mac-unfriendly. Anyway, I hope that there are enough UPS trucks in America to handle the returns that this item -- mine included -- will require.
easy to assemble, lightweight, but solid enough for outside. comfortable to sit in and eat on. the table top is a bit springy but all in all perfect for tight spaces.
I recently used it over a few smoked sable fillets - tasty! We also like the Marinara. So versatile, flavorful and convenient. --- 
I got this when my daughter was 4 months old.  She would sit in it for about 5 minutes, then want to get out.  But now that she is 6 1/2 months, she loves this and stays in it for about 30+ minutes and just entertains herself.  She has great coordination now and she loves to smack and grab the toys, and she coos at the little sun and loves to pull on everything and put it in her mouth.  When we go to family functions or just to someone's house, we always grab the entertainer.  It is very easy to break down and put right back together (if it doesn't fit in the car).  This by far is the best toy that she enjoys and LEARNS from.  She is quite tall for her age, 27 1/4 inches and we still have 2 more height adjustments on this.  This is the best $$$$ we have spent so far
I'm a first time DE shaver and this razor is great.  My grandfather used these types of razors, and it feels wonderful to be able to enjoy shaving rather than scraping my face with a Mach III. ---  --- Only advice is, try a couple different blades.  Depending on your skin type/beard you'll need a different type of blade.  One blade doesn't fit all.   And always remember, this isn't the Mach III, don't apply pressure
I bought this because my 8525 eats batteries and it's nice to have one charging while I'm using the other--you don't have to be tied to a wire to charge your phone.  So I also bought one of Boxwave's batteries for the 8525. ---  --- Well, the spare battery charger will charge the Boxwave battery just fine, but it refuses to charge the battery that came with my 8525.  This really limits its usability as an off-line charging device. ---  --- The cradle itself plugs into the USB port on the phone, which was not designed with cradling in mind, so it's not easy to get the thing lined up to use as an actual cradle.  Since the camera button is on the bottom of the phone (who's idea was that anyway?) it almost always gets pressed while I'm wiggling the phone in or out of the cradle.  This is just a bit of nuisance it just means you have to quit the camera application every time you put it in or take it out of the docking station. ---  --- Anyway, just my opinion, but it's actually easier to connect the standard USB charger to the phone than it is to put it in the cradle, so I'd recommend save your money and just sticking with the standard USB charger. ---  --- If you really want to do all charging off-line you may need to buy two Boxwave batteries instead of just one
Before I bought this reader I considered 2 models 12-in-1: Lexar and SanDisk. I decided to buy Lexar. --- I bought this reader to use mostly with Memory stick. I have 2 cards: 128 MB and 1 GB. I had no problem with 128 MB card.  --- But I could not insert My GIG card into this reader. It just did not go. I tried hard trying not to break the card - no success. It was a surprise for me. May be because my card was made not by Lexar - by SanDIsk...? I contacted Lexar but did not get any explanation of this problem. --- Any way I had to send it back and buy 12-in-1 SanDisk Reader. 
This was the WORST sunshade ever!!!  Don't waste your money.  It is so flimsy that it offers no sun protection at all.  We used it on our double jogger stroller but it just flopped down into the faces of our babies.   I do not recommend this product.  I only gave it a one star because zero star was not an option
This headseat is pretty neat when you're on the road or just relaxing between work.  It easily switches from media player to handsfree headset when you get a call and also controls the pause/play and answer/hangup features.  The comfort of the ear budds could be a little better, but the stereo sound is great
"House of Mirth" is one of the most depressing movies I've ever seen. ---  --- To be clear: I've seen movies like, oh, say, "Schindler's List," or "The Heart is a Lonely Hunter" that treat tragic events, either in the macrocosm or the microcosm, that did not leave me depressed. Rather, they were powerful works of art that moved me and made me think. ---  --- "House of Mirth" deals with tragic themes, including human society's ability to destroy its own, and the power of hypocrisy and hypocrites. It wasn't, though, moving or thought provoking.  ---  --- I wasn't moved by Gillian Anderson's portrayal of a betrayed woman who lives by her own sense of honor. I didn't believe Gillain Anderson's portrayal of a betrayed woman who lives by her own sense of honor. ---  --- Rather, I was bored. I kept wanting the film to go faster. It's a great irony; Edith Wharton's novels are real page turners. Quick, to the point. Hollywood has yet to adapt one of her books in a way that honors this quality.  ---  --- "House of Mirth" has gorgeous clothing and sets. I didn't care about anybody onscreen, though. I didn't believe anybody onscreen. ---  --- I felt that this movie had a misanthropic agenda, and it moved its players around as if they were chess pieces, as if to prove these points: people are hypocrites, see! People are insincere, see! If a person has any decency at all, that person is destroyed, see! ---  --- I would tend to agree with all of the above points. So ... why do I need to watch this movie? ---  --- Also, as a woman, who, as Lily Bart was meant to, has lived her life by her own code of honor and paid the price for that, I felt that this movie, no less than the Polite Society it depicts so brutally, betrayed Lily Bart. ---  --- Lily Bart is just a step above a passive masochist in this film. She all but participates in her own destruction. You want, just once, for her to show some initiative, some intelligence, some ability to create her own fate. ---  --- The film denies her those abilities. In this crippling of Lily Bart, the film seems to hate her as much as polite society does. ---  --- Movies like "Gone with the Wind" that depict spunky heroines occasionally winning, and occasionally gaining some power, imo, are much easier to watch.  ---  --- One might argue that such films are not realisitic. I don't know. Even we real-life Lily Barts have our resources, and our triumphs.  ---  --- And, again, watching Lily Bart in "House of Mirth" slowly being eroded onscreen was not a feminist experience for me. It was more of an art house snuff film that utterly disempowered its female heroine.
Got 3 of them a few months ago, and buying another one now.  Excellent product, fits many different plug types. No flaws.
Very good piece of music history. I still like the LP's sound a bit better then CD's due to some of the characteristic noise flaws but unfortunately LP's do not play in the car.
The copy of SimCity4 that I purchased came without the access codes to support instillation. When I called Electronic arts all I got was an automated phone system... press 2 now... EA's manufacturing quality control is so poor that they had a selection for products without access codes! I could never find a way to talk with a human beibng about the problem. The automated voice suggested solution was to send the product to them at my expsnse to prove that it came without the access code! I have returned the game to Amazon for a refund. I would never buy another EA product
These pencils are the best!They are the perfect texture and they last a long time
I think I must have got a bad batch because this polish is highly rated.  It never dried to a haze for me.  The first time i used it I thought I hadn't shaken the bottle enough.  The second time I shook the bottle - seven days later it still hasn't dried enough to buff off.  I'm not sure if its the product or whether Amazon are selling an inferior conterfeit
I love this minisisc. It holds an incredible amount of songs--the equivolent of an I-pod mini-- and the ease of use of my minidisc recorder is great. BUT DON'T BUY IT HERE! Just by having it in my order it jacked up the shipping charge by $9.00 while everything else in my order would have been shipped free. And you can get them at your neighborhood Radio Shack for the same price as here. I got a HI-MD recorder instead of an I-Pod and I'm glad I did. Just don't buy the disks from Amazon
Book is totally disorganized.  Beautiful pictures, but no way of researching values.  The price list is in the back organized by lot no & auction no.  NO reference to the illustration of the marbles in the front of the book, no way to look it up.  Starts out promising, then becomes a total jumble.  Totally impossible to locate anything.  Too time consuming, and then still no resolve
I bought a CASE, they expire in one month. They taste great, But SHAME on AMAZON. I also bough Butter Rounds, they expired LAST YEAR
I ordered this product and it arrived 2 days later. It is genuine Canon ink for a great price. I will definitely buy at amazon.com again
I don't know why this is, but when I put on the Dale Sr. shell for this car it started to understeer on left turns and would always crash into walls
I like this small thing. Work great and cheap
I just found this car at ToysRUs for $3.49; plus others in this series. I came online to Amazon to see if I could find characters not available at the store and I was blown away by these prices--$29.99???? You've got to be kidding me! I bought the TOY cars for my five year old son to PLAY with--the only reason I can see TOYS being priced this high is they must be trying to catch collectors. I'm glad I could find what I did at a local store; I definitely would not pay these high prices... --- I would have been very happy to buy others in the series from Amazon, but at these prices I am definitely NOT going to!
I had to repurchase this product, because my first one broke, the hinge that they use to attach the battery door to is pathetic, seriously a design flaw. However, with some Epoxy glue and a different type of hinge you can modify the origional product to be something better. In this case you really get what you pay for... Its dirt cheap plastic and it breaks easily. I wouldnt recommend getting this unless you need something dirt cheap and only plan on using it a few times.
I can say before I started to use this product I was always afraid of wearing white clothings but Tide to Go has totally changed everything.  Initially I thought this was just a gimmick but I thought it was worth a try,...soo...I bought it with me during our two-week trip with my parents in August..and it came handy...My dad bought a brand new white jacket and had it put on immediately and then decided to drink a cup of coffee..unfortunately, he spilled the coffee on the white jacket when he tried to open the lid to put sugar in it...my mother immediately wiped the coffee off with napkins..the coffee stain, however, was still there...Then..I remember I had put a Tide-to-Go in my purse...I immediately used it on all coffee stains on the white jacket...and to my surpise, all the brown spots resulted from the coffee spill were GONE...amazing..I have used this on different kind of food stains.  I've used it on Coffee stain, spaghetti sauce stain, juice stain and they all worked.  My mother, my mother-in-law, and my sister-in law they were all so amazed at the result that they all asked me for one to carry with them.  Nowadays I don't leave home without one in my purse..I used to be afraid of wearing white clothings, I am no longer afraid of wearing whites because of Tide-to-Go..this is definitely a useful product to carry with you everywhere you go..oh..as far as the smell goes..The smell is bearable to me...and in order to use it you have to push it down to get the actual fluid to flow out through the tip of the Tide-to-Go marker.
I have looked at many photography magazines - many of them are just filled with ads....not what an amateur is looking for. I wanted indepth articles, helpful tips and information to help me improve my craft. I found it here. I read every issue cover to cover and back again. I find helpful information in every issue. I highly recommend this magazine - even if you aren't purely an "outdoor" photographer
My SECOND review, as my first did not get printed (AS USUAL).  Anyway, I'll try to make this short and sweet.  I usually try and give credits to directors, producers, writers, and actors in most of my movie reviews; however, I'm going to make an exception here.  I've read other reviews that have called this gigantic turd "hilarious", "Night of the Living Dead + money + color", "wonderful for gorehounds", etc., etc., etc.  All I can say is it must not take much to please you people. ---  --- This is, WITHOUT A DOUBT, the WORST excuse for a movie I've ever seen.  (My most humble apologies to Tobe Hooper and "Mortuary").  The whiners of horror movies are always moaning and groaning, "why don't critics take horror movies more seriously?".  Well, Einstein, here's a glowing example.  This is nothing but grade D trash:  horrible effects, horrible acting, horrible writing, horrible directing.  You name it; it's NOT in there.  This movie's most FEEBLE attempts at humor come off as just that:  feeble.  I bought this, together with "Dead and Breakfast", and I can't begin to tell you which one is worse. ---  --- So, here's a little advice from me:  go check out a book at the library, buy a book, go to a REAL movie, have your hair done, have a manicure--do ANYTHING but waste your time on this gag-fest (for all the WRONG reasons) of a movie.  Another one that I would give ZERO stars to, if I could.
Authenic but a little bland for me. I add Ponzu sauce to taste and make sure it gets really HOT in the micriwave. If steaming when you take it out, it tastes better. Pre Rinsing the noodles (as directed) is nonsense. Just cover them with good clean water (I never use TAP) stir in the sauce and toppings and nuke it about 90 seconds, uncovered. Stir and serve. It had everyone in MY OFFICE drooling with questions! Best price is on Amazon, just order 2 so you don't pay shipping.
The pedometer worked great for the first two weeks. Than my 1 1/2 year old snatched it off my jeans, it fell on the tile floor and broke the casing of it. It still worked, but I had to be careful when I opened it because the back was broken and no longer attached. Last w/e it stopped working completely. Everthing is set to 0 and won't move. My husbands odometer seems to be working fine. However, I'm dissapointed for the short life-span.... ---  --- M. L. McDermot
My 11 year old saw this movie at school and wouldn't stop talking about it or asking for it. Since we couldn't find it at any store we amazoned it and there it was!!. Part of his Christmas present, he loves it. This movie is very inspiring and from what he says it makes him have hope in other people and what we can do to help others
I currently have two feeders in the back yard for the hummingbirds.  I love the way this one looks but the birds don't feed from it and I'm not sure why.  The other one will be empty and they still don't come to this one
This is a tasty on the go snack if you are lucky enough to get good fresh batch. The last bunch I got wasnt as enjoyable as I was used to. I realised it was because it lacked crunch. Would buy it again though. Great guilt free snack. Great for kids too
I love this show so much!! IT just has so much passion and beauty and all the cast members sing so well!! Sutton Foster as Jo, was cast very well, its obvious she deserved that Tony nomination in 2005, and the sisters, even though they weren't the leads, they all had such great songs, especially Beth, whose song, "Some things are meant to be" always brings tears to my eyes,its just so touching. I would definitely recomend this CD to anyone who loves musical theatr
This book is written from the viewpoint of a flaming socialist with the attitude that anything white or European or is overly valued in American history textbooks.  Loewen does have many valid points about what history textbooks omit, but the degree to which he is clearly slanted to the left is ludicrous.  "Lies My Teacher Told Me" could have been an amazing book, but all it did was aggrivate me and motivate me to write a 23 page paper debunking half of what the author wrote, much to the dismay of my idiotic Sociology professor.  The only reason I didn't give the book 1 star is because the overall intent and effort put forth were good, but the book as a whole is just far too biased
Feel sexy and tingly without the burn of most lip plumping products.  Your lips will be glossy, shiny and soft when you use this product
...for more than a couple of minutes (no matter what I did) and the toilet monster kept falling into the drink.  Overall it was quite underwhelming as a practical joke.  I've gotten much better results for the same money with other products
I bought this for my husband last year, and it's still in good condition.  We love it.  The whole family can fit under it.  It keeps the wind out really well, due to the double layers.  It never ever turns inside out
Decent quality, and no issues with interference at this frequency. Cannot be beat for the price
The day I ordered this pair at Amazon, I saw the same Homedics slippers at Sears for $21.99 on sale and I was immediately assured that price wise, this is a great buy. I got the slippers within 3 days. The material is very soft and "towely", and pretty in pink- it feels really good to just walk in them. Though they have a battery compartment underneath the sole, they are not too heavy to walk in either. Each slipper uses 2 AA batteries. The massage is actually more effective while sitting. And my mum and my sister keep eyeing my slippers. I ordered another one for my future mum-in-law as well! I'm sure she'll love it. Also, I wear a shoe size 8, sometimes 8.5, but the Homedics Small Size for the massaging slippers fit just fine, actually a little better coz a good fit gives a better feeling of the vibrations. If you're thinking of buying this, go for it
 ---  --- I have a pretty complicating sleep schedule because of my graveyard shift at our local convenient store, with school and all it's kind of hard keeping my sleep schedule straight. I've tried many sleep aids and this one worked the best for me, no grogginess which is totally awesome for the days I have class early! --- 
For those of you who only saw the new film last year (I bought it with this sight unseen because it looked interesting and it allowed me to get my favorite free shipping deal) here's your chance to see the Original stories of Flicka and her son Thunderhead.  These 3 films which I am told are pretty faithful to Mary O'Hara's novels of the same titles (I have them too but never read them).  The main difference between them and the 2006 remake is that is the central character is named "Ken (rather thank Katy McLaughlin", well at least the kept the same name in the remake) and is played by a young Roddy McDowell in the first 2 films and Robert Arthur in the third.  The reason he probably didn't do "Green Grass" is that the same year (1948) he was making the second big screen version of Robert Louis Stevenson's Kidnapped.  The first film was released on VHS years ago, and both the first 2 had been previously released on DVD to celebrate their 60th anniversaries.  Unfortunately those discs are out of print, albeit some Amazon sellers are still offering them separately or together.  But the copies in this set are exactly the same discs, except for the pictures on the jackets and the labels on the discs.  The text on the back of the boxes and list of chapter stops (on the lists and discs) are exactly the same as the previous releases.  This is also the only way to get all 3 (if you don't count the old copies) as only the first film has been re-released as a separate item (it also marks the first appearance of "Green Grass" on video in any way, shape or form).  By the way, it was also made into the a short lived tv series in 1956 which I doubt we will ever see again.  If you like the books and movies of Anna Sewell's Black Beauty and Walter Farley's Black Stallion and the 2006 remake interests (or interested you), get this set before they go out of print again.
This toy is the coolest toy I've ever used! When I have slumber parties I always play music, and my friends always say that I have the coolest boombox. Some of them are even thinking about buying one. I love listening to music on my brand new bratz lips boombox. And this year at my birthday slumber party, I'm gonna play music all night. This toy is just so cool!!!!!!!!
I bought this for the Jeffrey Dahmer and John Wayne Gacy documentaries, like I imagine you might. I'm not disappointed really, I don't regret buying it in any sense, it's just that this DVD isn't very good at all. It doesn't attempt to make any insight, which isn't something I particularly care for anyway. What each documentary offers is a limited and quite dated view of the serial killers. I can't imagine anyone learning something they didn't already know from them. It's mostly told through pictures when it seems there's option to use video. The Dahmer documentary, made in 1993, doesn't feature anything of interest. There's no interview with his father or anything, just a voice telling a story over pictures we've all seen before, with occassional clips of victims' families in court. The Gacy one, made in '96, is the same. There's also a program, made in 1997,on criminal profiling. This look at three farely well known killers whose capture supports profiling. It's told often with video rather then photos, which is good, but still they're somewhat boring subjects. The Criminal Profiler, Dahmer, and Gacy are all episodes from the A&E series Investigative Reports, if you didn't realise. The last program is on Charles Manson. It's quite different from the others on the disc. Made in 1997, it originally aired on television as Biography: Charles Manson: Journey Into Evil. I don't with have any interest in Manson, but I guess it's ok. It features significant interviews with Manson and main female members of the Family. All programs run for about one hour or more. I wouldn't reccomend any of them, none are good at all. I might even describe them as terrible, considering what else is out there
Please do not spend your time and money with this wristtop. I received with battery problems, it does not charge completely and suunto does not have the proper tech service available to fix it. You have better and cheaper options such as forerunner 201 or 301 or the timex trail runner. The suunto signal detection is quite weaker and when hiking grand canyon the unit remained most of time without capturing signal at all
I read some reviews that there were some compatability issues with this sensor and the main unit. However, I had no trouble at all getting this sensor to work with my existing unit and sensor, once I realized I need to reset the main unit in order for it to recognize the newest sensor. I have one sensor outside in my garage and the other downstairs in my basement and they both work well and are pretty accurate with the actual temperature. This was an excellent purchase
It is great! you have to buy it, believe me. Don't waste your time looking for another case, this is the best
Besides that outdoor temperature and relative humidity, I use the base station inside along with three remote wireless monitors to measure temperature and humidty in my crawlspace, attic and outdoors to monitor possible water intrusion issues and if there are freezing temperature concerns for the pipes during cold weather periods
NO TECHNICAL SUPPORT THAT'S WORTH ANYTHING!  PROGRAM DOES NOT WORK PROPERLY! VERY USER UNFRIENDLY! OTHERWISE I WISH I WOULD NOT HAVE PURCHASED IT! NEED SOMETHING THE AVERAGE COMPUTER NUT CAN USE EFFECTIVELY
I am utterly disappointed in the direction that Gamepro has taken over the past two years. I actually stopped my subscription for about 1 year, but came back to the 20 issues for $10 at their (10?) year anniversary.  I forget.  But the magazine is really bad. ---  --- One thing I laugh is, the retro corner.  They have info about issues from 5 and 10 years before, and they always announce the number of pages from 10 years ago. I think the most recent issue, they said: 140 pages?  Huh?  I think my last issue was around 100.  And don't try to tell me they've lost 40 pages in advertising.  ---  --- Too bad on-line reviews and websites, are taking over the subscriptions of the hardcopy magazines. I'll stick with hardcopy until the end of my life. Or until the quality of these types of magazines gets so low, I can't stand it anymore.  Or until my subscription runs out on this craptacular effort.  ---  --- You guys were pretty good 5 years ago, but you've gone to pot these past two years!  I'm talkin' to you Watchdawg!!! ---  --- You guys are suckin' lately!!! ---  --- MC White said:  You guys are suckin'!!
Used this product to softmod my xbox. Had to download an older version of the software though. If you just use it to cheat in games..probably not worth the money.
I have used this twice a day and love it. Best buy at this price
I was so dissapointed with this camera! I purchased a Sony Cybershot 3 years ago and, it had been such a great camera, I automatically thought this newer model would be great. Almost every picture I took was either blurry or the light areas of the picture were blown out! As an experienced Cybershot user, I tried all settings to fix the problem, but no luck. Terrible for capturing a child's first steps, as the description says. Would not recommend
I will be utterly honest, I don't buy music CDs anymore.  With so many bands hitting the streets faster than I can imagine, I honestly cannot keep up with them all.  Music begins to sound the same, corporations seem to have their pre-determined hit prior to the public even forming their own opinion.  Those like the Simpsons, Backstreet Boys, and even hip-hop artists are blending together to sound uniform, unoriginal, and overly drab.  I had nearly lost my faith in music, retreating to some of my older music like DMB, Counting Crows, and Travis, but then I found ... The Suns. ---  --- Stumbling around the Internet I discovered, shockingly, one of the videos to their album called "Romantic Death".  It was one of the most creative and disturbing videos that I have seen in quite some time.  Then it hit me, I couldn't get this song out of my mind.  Throughout the whole day I had the beat, the lyrics, and the overall sensation of the song stuck in my mind ... and I had only heard it once.  Like a drug, I needed more.  When I returned home that evening I found the song again and couldn't stop listening to it.  For the first time in a long time, I had found a new band. ---  --- Then, I bought this album.  Knowing nothing about the band except for the "Romantic Death" song, I put this in my DVD player and continued to be impressed.  Their videos are just as smart as their music.  Their tracks seem to cover every genre of music from folk, rock, and even hard edge.  Their lyrics seem well-considered, smart and a voice to a new generation.  My favorites of the album are:   ---  --- "Must Be You" --- "Romantic Death" (Parental Guidance is suggested)  --- "Lost at Home" --- "Rockstop" --- "We Tried" ---  --- In fact, every time I listen to this album I find a new song to explore, a new song to jam to on the way to work; a new song to enjoy!  For those skeptical of this band, I suggest this album to test your tastes.  Not only does it provide songs for you to burn onto other CDs which allow friends and family to explore this band, but also all of their energetic, original videos that will never see the light of day on MTV, but can be watched from the leisure of your DVD player.  The Sun are a breath of fresh air to the music industry and this album finally got me out of the corporate rut that seems to be plaguing this industry. ---  --- "...if the rockstops, it'll be all my fault..." ---  --- Grade: ***** out of ***** 
Like someone else said, I don't have a problem paying for a high quality beauty item that works as it says it does.  Cinnamon buns has a great lather, smells wonderful when you use it, and makes your skin soft.   ---  --- I have used it as a shampoo and the scent lingers a bit longer using it on your hair, but it really doesn't function as well as a shampoo as it does as a shower gel.  For a bubble bath ya have to use so much of it I just can't do it. I find myself counting  the ounces I'm pouring under the faucet and have decided to use it as a treat only. ---  --- The smell doesn't last very long, but have found that it does linger longer if you lather, rinse and repeat, like it says on the bottle.   ---  --- It's a dollar an ounce.....not sure if I'll try any of the other 'flavors' simply because of the cost
Nice cushions that dry out pretty fast.  Seem durable.  They also seem high quality.  The only thing is they are more of a tan color-- the picture shows them as white which is what I really wanted.  But they are nice.  Could use a strap at the top also so the wind doesn't constantly blow them over
I received this as a Christmas gift and thought, "Why not... I'll try it."  The woman who bought the gift for me also has one and told me NOT TO APPLY ANY PRESSURE when using the device.  As a redhead, I have extremely sensitive, thin skin so I followed her advice very carefully.  I did not apply any pressure what-so-ever, and didn't keep the device in one area for too long.  The result..... worse than any sunburn I've ever had!  My legs are burned in various areas, as the product sanded off the first layer of my skin!  The skin hardened and has begun to crack in the burned areas.  I'm a little concerned and think I should call my physician, as the condition is extremely painful.  Worst of all, the hair grew back immediately the next day and I had to shave the areas that were not burned.  This is a terrible, dangerous product!  
I bought this for my 5  year old daughter and we tried to take very good care of it.  Within a few days of careful use, one of the latches bent, a hinge broke off and a piece of the edge came unglued.  It is a great idea, but needs better construction.  On a positive note, my daughter loved it and would have spent hours drawing and creating with the tools inside if I let her.  However, I had to take the box away so further damage does not occur before I can fix it.  The drawers work fine.  The problem is with the two doors on top that flip out.  Note about drawers; Little plastic door knobs pop out.  Need to be glued in. 
This was the movie that gave us The Brat Pack, a staple of a certain 80s cultural set.  The term Brat Pack was derived from an article writen by a journalist out one night with most of the men starring in St. Elmo's Fire on a boozy night of partying.  Since then the gals in the movie as well as a few others who weren't in the movie (Anthony Michael Hall, for example) suffered a bit of a ripple effect.  Here we will see all of them at their prime and at their peak of heart throb success on every teenage girl's bedroom wall. ---  --- Out of all the dramedies of the John Hughes movies, this was the one I liked the least.  Maybe it was the fact that all the characters were so vain and self centered.  Maybe it was the fact that it was all so idealized seeing all of them trying to adjust to their lives after graduating college.  It was trying to be the next generation "Graduate" movie, and I didn't relate when my time came.  Maybe it had to do with the fact that I have been let down by many people and didn't have that network of friends in similar situations, and the isolation I felt during that first year adjusting to the outside world having left the nest of academia.  I guess I was just a little more bitter.  Plus, as my life was surrounded by work and little else, I didn't have all the dramas going on they did. ---  --- That was kind of sad, the one scene where Rob Lowe goes back to his old frat house and they tell him they need someone like him to couch their team.  It proves you really can't go home again and there are some clinging to the past.  Not to mention embarrassing with that one gal who has managed to hold onto her virginity for so long and in one of the attempts to releive her of it Rob Lowe finds those enormous granny panties.   ---  --- This caputed more of a time in fashion and music than it did a mindset.  It's not a bad story, but the vain and self centered antics of the main characters left me cold.   
I gotta be honest, when I first listened to this album I was dissapointed. But like any truly amazing album, it just took some decoding, listening to the songs multiple times reaaaallly helps to appreciate what these guys are doing. Essentially, GaT are four people who are amazing at what they do, and we should feel lucky that they have found a way to mesh together perfectly. Their first album, emphasizer, blew me away, but I felt it lost steam around halfway through. This album does no such thing, and what is more impressive is that this is an all acoustic album, which means skerik is using the natural sound of his sax as opposed to the various effects that he is known for. This gives the album a much more natural feel and it shows that these four are able to make amazing music without any wizardry in the production department. But dont get me wrong, this cd SOUNDS amazing. Anyway, I saw them live last night in NYC, and they blew my mind... I recommend this CD to ANYONE, and see them live if you get the RARE opportunity!
This book is a somewhat linear history of the past 13,000 years across the continents.  Diamond seeks to sum up history across various societies on all the continents in a relatively short volume.  The impetus for this search starts with a question from a friend of his from New Guinea named Yali.  Yali's question was, "Why is it that you white people developed so much cargo and brought it to New Guinea, but we black people had little cargo of our own?" ---  --- Reading the book, I think I gulped at this point.  This sounds like a classic, loaded question.  It sounds disturbingly close to why have we (Europe and its former colonies) succeeded where they have failed.  Diamond does not descend into that territory though, but he does not evade criticism for skirting it completely.  There are references to a culture's success in industrializing or condensing populations that Diamond brushes off as a mixed blessing, for instance.  The advantages of a hunting/gathering culture are not really explored outside of the remarkable sustaining nature of southeast Asia. ---  --- This history can probably be described (or perhaps is most successful) as based around environmental causation (as opposed to the racial/ethnic/social causation that the lump in my throat had been fearing).  Descriptions of climate (note: that the history begins with the cessation of the last great ice age), longitudinal or latitudinal axes, elevation and landmass differences play a strong role in determining the fate of humanity.  Still, it is interesting to look specifically at the items gathered in the title. ---  --- Guns.  Europe's refinement of this technology was based on China's innovations with gunpowder.  Today's dominant society is a product as much of what it has swallowed and thus incorporated as by what it has innovated.  As an interesting counterpoint, Japan had owned more and better guns in c. 1600 CE, than any country in the world.  Samurai rulers first limited then outlawed the technology.  Japan wouldn't resume manufacture until mid 19th century.  Obviously, there is an indisputable importance in the weaponry's influence in shaping the geopolitical world of today. ---  --- Germs.  Epidemics left people from cultures based on cities with who could resist smallpox and those dense populations more easily replaced those who didn't survive.  Smaller groups have a distinct disadvantage versus the interdependent and consequently more interchangable larger cities.  Epidemics develop out of these civilizations as germs jump over from domesticated animals (and smaller groups may not even have animals to domesticate).  Interesting note: the emperors of the Mayan and Incan civilizations both succumb to disease (likely smallpox) rather than guns. ---  --- Steel.  Technological advancement is keyed on innovations brought about by dense populations and the possibility for abstraction of responsibilities.  A hunter-gatherer culture lacks the abstraction necessary to divide responsibilities to allow for such developments as literacy and mining, as the energies that would fuel these are directed toward survival areas.  Diamond makes an interesting and controversial point that the hunter-gatherer culture may be more attuned to intelligence as an evolutionary necessity over civilized society, where the evolutionary energy may be directed at surviving these epidemic illnesses. ---  --- There are many aspects of environment that serve as limiting conditions for the development of these things.  First, there appears to need to be sustainable farming.  Many of the staples of modernity are the crops first domesticated in the fertile crescent region (where today we invade, suck oil, and force the conquered to endure freedom).  The western Asian breadbasket provided the means to bank food so that trades could develop.  As a complete side note, the Genesis book of the bible can be viewed upon through this filter as it goes into great detail how Joseph set up a system of storing and meting grain in Egypt to greatly increase the population and avoid the calamity of drought and famine brought on by sustenance farming. ---  --- Another factor in the civilizing of Eurasia is the landmass itself.  Compared to Africa and the Americas, Eurasia is mainly west-east axis versus north-south.  Movement of successes in cultivation and domestication could more easily occur because climate differences are easier on a latitudinal basis than on longitudinal.  Something like corn (maize) which was domesticated in central Americas took a very long time to make it to North America because of geography.  Llamas and guinea pigs (which could be useful for pack animals and food) never made it north.  Conversely, all those fertile crescent crops and bigger domesticated animals like cattle, horses, pigs were able to spread from one tip of Asia to the opposite tip of Europe. ---  --- To answer Yali's question, some of the answer is luck.  Africa, Australia and the Americas may not have been afforded the botanical or zoological advantages that Eurasia had.  Some other is environmental determinism, where you are helps make up who you become.  For going forward, Diamond cites transportation, communication and information advances as factors that likely will obliviate these historical forces in the future. ---  --- After word: Harpers Magazine tackles an issue that was brought up, but not as fully developed here, that of pre-Clovis Native American discoveries (pronouncements), knowingly confronting a loaded racial/ethnocentric question in a folio called "Might White of You: Are American Archaeologists White Supremacists?"  The archaeological records supports people living in the Americas since about 9000-11000 BCE.  There are scant scraps of evidence prior to that date, but plenty of theories typically more titillating than substantive.  One wonders if the pre-Clovis discovery (especially all the business about "caucusoid" skulls), isn't so much about archaeology as setting up an imagined genocide to justify a documented genocide. ---  ---  --- 
I love a good, intricate storyline in a game as much as the next person. The RPG, known for it's generally intricate plotline, is one of my favorite genres. And to The Incredible Hulk Ultimate Destruction's credit, it does contain a story penned by a seasoned comicbook author. And again to the game's credit, the story really isn't too bad (fairly generic, but servicable). The script is voiced adequatly, and presented in a way that doesn't deter from the real focus of the game: Rampant, wanton, gratuitous destruction in some of the most creative ways possible. I love The Hulk as a character. I even liked the Ang Lee flick (no hate mail please-myfriends give me enough crap for that one as it is). There's something cathartic about a nearly indestructable creature that operates on pure Id. Who doesn't want to just lose it when we get pushed too far? This game has many things going for it: it controls very well, nearly every object in the vast and varied environments is destructable in some way shape or form, and the graphics are certainly servicable (although not top-notch). The best way to describe this is to take an open gamespace like the Grand Theft Auto games, minus the infuriatingly difficult missions, and add a set of missions that beg you to destroy everything. Every mission is based in some way on the premise of you as a giant green demolition expert. Now this may sound like it would wear thin quickly, but the game does remain fresh do in large part to a huge selection of upgraded moves that you can 'buy' with smashpoints, which are awarded via smashing things (deep huh?). It is really a massive orgy of soothing mayhem, and mercy is it ever satisfying! If you tried out the first Hulk game, please be aware that this is NOTHING like that. There are no more tedious sneaking missions as Bruce Banner. YOU ARE THE HULK, and the Jade Giant is an absolute gas in this title. Like the GTA games, you are not forced into playing missions (although this does unlock new moves and arenas to play in). You can take on side quests which are not only pretty creative, but downright hilarious in others (try 'batter up!' for an example of the latter). If the first Hulk game and Ang Lee's movie left a sour taste in your mouth when it comes to Mr. Green Genes, then give this one a shot. In my opinion, they got the essence of the Hulk down pat, and show him for the fun character that he can be. Later!     --- 
The Night Owl Optics monocular had a major flaw as soon as I started using it. The system uses high voltage derived from 2-AA bateries. Occationally the unit would create a large snap(arcing noise) and emit a bright flash of light from the eyepiece. If one is using the instrument, the light actually hurts the eye. I have returned the monocular to Night Owl for repairs. I do not know the result of the repairs as it is still in transit. They told me to ship it at my expense. --- Another strange requirement of the instrument is that the batteries are recommended to be removed if not used for 24 hours. --- Other than the above, the monocular has performed well. --- epilogue-Night Owl Optics did repair the unit and returned it.
I've had foot problems this past year. Shoes that I had worn comfortably for years, including other Rockports, Ecco, New Balance, Avia, Reebock, Asics, etc..., were suddenly uncomfortable and painful to wear all day long. ---  --- These Rockports are great. I'm finally NOT in a hurry to get home and get into my slides. I was to the point that I'd pay $300 or better for a comfortable pair of shoes. This shoe is well worth the money
The product came promptly and I am happy with the quality.  However fitment wasn't perfect as the ends would sit a little higher than my treo.  Not a huge problem, but something I would feel everytime I reach for the stylus. But the pen works pretty good, and it feels sturdy in my hands.  I would definately recomment this product to others
Great Music, Great band. This is a must buy. Recommended to all hard rock lovers
This film starts out so promising.  It could have been a punchy dramatic piece about the nature of belief, and the legitimacy of the concept of free will.  Instead, the characters dribble into infantile sexuality, and the film becomes a travelog.  I can't believe this film found financing...a real waste of obvious talent.  The effect of the ending is to trivialise the opening premise, hence the film winds up being an exercise in meaninglessness with an unpleasant aftertaste
The earrings were very cute and the screw backs were definitely a good find. My daughter loved them so much she actually had them almost a whole month before she lost one.  But that is no bash on the earrings, the fact that she did not lose them the first week is a major accomplishment. ---  --- I would definitely buy them again.
Love my new watch!  It is very thin and comfortable.  I get compliments every time I wear it.
Purchased this for my son. He loves wearing it (he's a big fan of ny and the pd). Fits well, washes well
All year long, my three and a half year old daughter asked for a digital camera for Christmas.  3-weeks before Christmas, she sat on Santa's lap at the mall and asked for a TRUMPET of all things.  I immediately came home and searched online.  Everyone had the colorful play trumpets that were electronic with diferent characters on them, but none of them looked real!  And I'm pretty sure that my daughter was expecting Santa to bring a real trumpet, so I found this, ordered it and it was here BEFORE the estimated delivery date! ---  --- It is extremely lightweight (cannot be used as a weapon), each button has a different tone to it AND it looks real (besides the fact that it's not brass).  She loved it!  She plays it all the time and unbelievably, it's not the most annoying toy she has.  I would recommend it to anyone with young children interested in musical instruments
I purchased this camera a year ago (summer 05).  Definitely a great upgrade over the original rebel, although the new xti has a larger screen which is the one aspect of this camera that is not perfect.  There are other sites that will perform more comprehensive reviews of this camera, but after a year mine is still working perfectly
I bought this perfume for my husband, and both of us love it. Very sexy, and yet a clean scent at the same time. It's light enough to be perfect for the man who normally doesn't wear perfumes, yet elegant enough for the man who does
I love the workmanship in this piece. Nicely done, and Silver Insanity has Awesome customer service
A big disappointment.After filling with hot water as instructed the water temp cooled off immediately regardless of the "warmer" as advertized.It was too shallow to cover the feet if massage attachments were in place.I returned it for a refund
Both my 3-year old daughter and my 5-year old son (to his father's chagrin) love playing with and endlessly dressing Dora. Her outfits are darling and my children enjoy mixing and matching (or not-so-matching in some cases) the clothes, too. We are looking forward to adding new outfits as well as the armoire and bed - Dora needs a place to sleep! ---  --- Dora is well made and sturdy, and her clothing has even been through the wash and no harm done.  ---  --- And I have to admit ... I've been known to dress Dora a time or two myself. We have the same problem with the shoes not staying on well, but it doesn't seem to bother my little ones at all
This item is such a great value.  Everything included is a basic necessity.  For anyone interested in getting into boxing, I suggest this set as your first purchas
An excellent project for your child's school report.  We purchased the Velociraptor kit for our 8 year old daughter not knowing what to expect. After opening the package my wife came up with the clever idea of pouring melted chocolate chips into the dinosaur molds, instead of using the plaster mix that comes with the kit. We experimented with white chocolate chips and created realistic looking dinosaur bones! We buried these edible bones in ground up Oreo Cookies.  What a thrill to see our daughter's 2nd grade class excavate these delectible prehistoric fossils!  We can't wait to purchase other kits in the Eyewitness series
Love this little lamp!  I bought it for my crafting area, and its compact and nice and bright as well.  I love the swivel head too so I can adjust which direction the light shines.  Buying Partners, LLC (through Amazon) is the company I purchased from and they were quick to ship! 
This book is very disappointing, as is most of Gunaratna's work on islamist terrorism. It's the sort of stuff governments and many of the public want to hear, ie. bin Laden and AQ are everywhere, responsible for every terrorism attack and all regional terorist groups (such as JI) are AQ franchises - total bollocks. The book lacks solid and verifiable reserach and is written by a "scholar" who spends most of his time doing alarmist media commentary
This CD is supberb!!  Absolutely fabulous.  I received it timely and have enjoyed listening to it over and over again.  All my deslings with Amazon thusfar have been outstanding. ---  --- Thanks, Amazon ---  --- Laura Rig
This watch died (battery?) one year after I bought it.  I like the watch, it  fits well and I'm able to swim in the pool and ocean with it.  But I can't find a place to repair it here on Maui.  It has a 3 year warranty but I'd have to mail it in.  After the battery is changed it needs to be pressure tested.  What a hassle..
I received one of these towels as a gift several years ago.  It was, by far, one of the best gifts I have ever received!  It soaks all of the water out of your hair and leaves it perfect for blow drying.  For women, this is a five star gift
Flight from death is a "must see" documentary. I saw it three times since i've received the DVD last week and each time i discover new aspects. Images are beautiful and the commentary (narrated by Gabriel Byrne) is just outstanding. Before seeing it, i was a little bit anxious to see how they can translate in a documentary the rather complex thought of Ernest Becker. As a reader of Becker's books for many years i can tell that Patrick Sean and Greg Bennick had done a fantastic job. Each important parts of Becker's understanding of the impact of death anxiety on human behavior are explored and very well explained. I understand now why this documentary won seven prizes. Please do not hesitate to buy this DVD you won't regret it!  --- 
When my boyfriend bought this for me I was so happy and I remember I would play this music and sing for him in the car on cool dark, starry nights and I would be mesmerized not only by the intensity of those nights, but by the music she sang and how she deeply, richly portrayed those songs. She really knew how to set the mood for any lover or lonely lover as well. I totally recommend this CD to start if you have not heard much of her music...SHe truly is addicting once you hear these songs...These songs will definetly put you in an enchanting and romantic journey
I have many men magazine, none comes close to Men's Health. Some magazines are too glossy that spell "expensive" for what ever they wanted to promote. With Men's Health, I get to everything from A to Z. I always pass my old copies to my local library for their own collection
This is absolutely the worse digital device I have ever owned.  The manual is worthless and the web site even worse.  I try to delete the included photos, and nothing happens.  I can't download photos from my Mac.  If your digital memory card has many photos, good luck trying to find the ones you want to download to the frame.
The off-on switch on this product is very difficlut to use.  I am not able to turn off or on with one hand and find it very difficult to turn on with two hands.   
I have used Synmatec products for many years and have been fairly pleased by them.  However, don't buy the upgrade or renew your subscription until AFTER your current subscription runs out because Synmatec will not give you credit for the un-used portion of your previous subscription.  I asked and they said "no way".  That aspect of "customer service" is very disappointing
Not only is the popcorn incredibly salty, but they do not taste very crispy.  Quite stale.  Overall, disappointing.  I sent my stuff overseas with delivery within 4 days after receiving them, so it is not that I kept them too long.  Too bad, they are too far to return.  Overall a disappointing experience
This mix was very sour, and because of the way the fruits are dried, there were a LOT of crumbs inside the packets
This was one of the most dissappointing debut albums to come out of the Mid Nineties G-Funk heyday. Warren G. didn't even produce one song on this sorry attempt at making hard/soft gangsta rap except for the title track that was already used on his album a year before. The skits are ridiculous, the music is halfass, and the lyrics are amateur. There is absolutely nothing that keeps the listener's attention for a whole album. This is similar to other West Coast rap albums that play it too safe such as W.C. and the Madd Circle's debut and Coolio's "It Takes A Thief". One star for the hit single "Summertime in the L.B.C.".
I bought this net to accompany a Kettler basket I recently bought for my bicycle - and it fits perfectly - It was as if they were made for eachother...I can either wrap it around my basket or hook it onto my rear rack...6 hooks and a directional bias make it immensely practical..
For this price these are a steal! Purchased mine for $15 (with shipping) and let me tell you, it was worth it! The headphones come with a 1/4 converter too! So you can use them for cd players and amps! The sound quality is good, and the headphones don't hurt half as much as other ones after wearing for several hours. These are an amazing deal for the price, I'm honestly surprised these arn't marked for $50. Don't pass these up if your looking for decent quality headphones
When I saw that most of the critical parts, the ones that bear the brunt of the force were made of plastic, I told my wife "this isn't going to last long." ---  --- In the very place I had concerns is where mine broke.  A simple metal pin, instead of a plastic one would have made all the difference. ---  --- I also just noticed in these "customer reviews" that right after someone posts a negative review, a positive albeit anonymous review is posted.  That always makes me wonder
There's nothing in this I'd say even remotely resembles jazz. It's repetitive, has a rock beat, and consists mostly of licks taken from other players. If you're looking for backrgound music to play in a waiting room, this might be a good choice
I watched parts of all the "Let's Dance Salsa" DVDs and what a joke.  Is this guy serious?  He needs to get a few DVDs himself to find out about Salsa, rhythm, lead and following, and just general concepts of dancing.  I agree with a few other folks who wrote reviews...what qualifies him as an instructor?   ---  --- I think he's doing an injustice to Salsa.  If anyone is considering learning from these DVDs...don't.  You'll not only learn some bad habits in dancing, but you'll be a joke on the dance floor. ---  --- The only worth these DVDs have to anyone interested in Salsa is for a good laugh.  Seriously...Amazon should consider removing this product
This was a subject of much conversation when I was deployed to Saudi Arabia and it's still a favorite with most military and Civilians in Iraq. "Ground Hog Day" is a term used to describe the seemingly endless days that are all the same...until finally,the day comes when the alarm goes off and you wake up realizing it's the day you leave. The movie is high in entertainment value and the story is unusual and unique; Bill Murray was the perfect choice to cast in the lead roll and the supporting cast all played their parts just as well. It's fun watching the lead character develop and become a new man, and it almost makes me wish we had a piano here.
This item is cute. My only complaint is that it really can only hold the camera. There is no space for an extra card or battery. It does however have a convenient belt clip on the back that you could also attach a shoulder strap to.
This book is nothing more than a chaotic brainstorm session with no pertinent information at all. You could save yourself time with a pen and some paper and a group of friends because thats all this author did. Book doesnt SHOW you how to start up any of the ideas it just lists them. It also has a plethora of grammatical errors and is almost as if the editor didn't even bother to read it before sending it to the presses. It is a complete waste of time and not worth the ninety cents it costs to buy it used.
I ordered the product thinking that it should be good for the price. But it doesnot keep the warm water warm for 10 mintues. The pedicure set is hard to use. The bubbles are not effective.I guess cheap is expensive!!!
Most of the items were fine. They were just given as gifts with 4 damaged. --- I have tried to return without success. I am disappointed that I am not able to return damaged or not functioning items. --- I may think twice about ever doing this agai
This camcorder is the best I have ever had!I have 5 others all higher and lower priced models for my business, I do video photography as one of my jobs. I love this camera, I dont know what would do without it! My kids can even operate it, we have made so many quality movies at home. I also use this camcorder for paid wedding and special occasion videos, it works great and I love the brand I really perfer it to others. Its not for you if you arent going to use alot or have a problem with the size, I dont think it's that big but then again I use some equipment thats enormous. This is not a palm Caamcorder.  --- Once you figure out if this is the camera for you, you will be please, I enjoy it a lot!! There are descriptions of the camcorder, options and quality of the product on this page. --- I love it and hope my short review helps. I know this is a non-detail review but all the info is on this page. This isnt for a person looking for a $400 dollar camera, if you want quality movies or use it for your job, ect. I really think this one is great! Hope this is useful, Camcorder Fanati
I love these things. Amazon is the only place I found to order these Cheddar Fries. The 1 oz. bag is the perfect snack size, especially for those on WW. Each 1 oz. bag is 3 points. Not bad for a "junk food" snack!! Awesome price and fast delivery
Going from charging my phone a couple times a day to charging it once every couple days has definitely changed by opinion of my A900, making it less high-maintenance and allowing me to do some web browsing, headset using, and general multimedia mayhem without the constant paranoid fears that this fooling around will cost me when the OEM battery decides to die at the most inopportune time.  Quite a cheap price for the freedom and peace of mind.  It's been 12 hours and the thing has yet to change from 3 bars.  What!?  Aside from the piddling cost of this battery (which is about double the tax you'd pay on a battery at a Sprint dealership), there is the tax of the bulge it creates on its backside.  To me, this is not insignificant, but is ignorable, as it doesn't detract from the aesthetics of the phone and it provides a way to grip it when dialing, talking, or using the buttons
I've used several types of cervical cold packs over the past few years, both at home and also professional cold packs at chiropractic appointments to help decrease muscle inflammation, and this is by far the best because of its super flexible fabric immediately from the freezer and its ability to stay cold for a longer time if needed
this in an uninspired telling of a transparent political fable.  Good enough to watch once
In general...this program worked very well.  I've had a hard time putting my new Dual Core Pentium D computer in the RAID 1 configuration, so I bought this instead.  The clone function works extremely well and is an adequate alternative to the RAID 1 configuration, but I was a bit confused about how to use the "incremental backup" function.  The initial backup went well, but when I went back for incremental backup additions, it would tell me it was "impossible"....so I just clone the C drive every few weeks now.  I have two Seagate 320 GB SATA hard drives, and it's great to know that I have an exact copy of the c drive if I fry it.  I live in Ethiopia, so the power fluctuations are frequent and disastorous.  I've already lost one hard drive to power flux abnormalities.  I'd buy this product again, and it's comforting to know that it's on my system and that I can back up my valuable data easily and quickly when I need to
This dryer works great but it gets pretty hot.  Watch your ears and fingertips
This movie is a wonderful follow up to the first...Anne has the same charming spirit and the cast is just as wonderful as they were the first time. I highly recommend this movie to anyone
Europe and Japan - the final great pop frontiers !  ---  --- ....last I heard it was Austin ?  - OH WELL !  ---  --- Canada shows love too...our favorite neighbors....do ya a favor !  ---  --- There are some really interesting Japanese based labels...search on web and be impressed !
After her amazing performance in Misery, Bates takes the role of another Stephen King character: Dolores Claiborne. --- Dolores is a tough, bitter, sarcastic woman who is accused of murdering her despotic employer, Vera Donovan. We are all hasty to set a judgement upon her, but as her story unfolds we realize that things are far more complex than what they seemed at the beginning of the movie.Jennifer Jason Leigh proves why she is one of the best young actresses around by playing Celina, Dolores's troubled daughter who hates her mother for the wrong reasons. I own this dvd since 2000 and it is still one of my favorites
Bought this as a girft for my mother, and she loves reading them. Must be really good
Je suis un peu du par cet album... c'est morne, le son est pas top... a trane dans les longueurs... bref ennuyeux! mais bon il faut se mettre  l'poque aussi! a  qd mme 13 ans
I tried, I really did, but I couldn't get beyond 100 pages.    I love Iris Johansen books but it seemed she had no joy in writing this one, almost as if she were forced to do so.  It contained none of her usual style.  The dialogue was choppy and boring and nothing made you care about the characters.  I'm still a fan and hope the next book is written in more typical IJ style. 
Well worth the money, and considered on the the most timeless and staple classics for your makeup bag
Excellent value for money. My razr is a fully functional mp3 player now! Thanks. :
I bought this Item for my husband for xmas and he loved it but once they were all put together they would fall apart fairly easy but other then that they are great I highly recomend this especialy for a husband or son
What a pleasure to put together!! It  took me 1hr. to assemble. --- All the parts were there, and I diden't need assistance. Just leaned it against the wrought iron rail of the patio and presto!! I was enjoing a fire in no time!
I have been a 34 size for my entire life and this bra fits terrible...the fabric is stiff and so uncomfortable..I could not wait to take it off. Champion should stick to making sports bra...do not buy this bra or you will suffer. Plus, it looks much thinner in the picture..it is really thick...it feels like a maternity bra. UGH
Works work, what cam I say. I have been using microsoft products for years. Quality easy to use products are the reason they are a software giant.
[First of all: I only gave this one star because the rating doesn't let you go any lower] I only listened to this album because someone who was utterly disgusted with it threw it on the floor and stomped on it, leaving me to pick it up. I proceeded to suffer through it so I could give you fair warning. If you buy this, consider yourself warned
I first came across Taste of Home Magazine about 10 years ago. Some friends of mine were quite the experimental couple who loved to try out new recipes. As the recipient of tasty appetizers, dips, and desserts, I asked them for the recipes. It was then that they shared this magazine with me...and I've been a subscriber ever since! ---  --- Each magazine features several special features, as well as mainstay departments such as Potluck Pleasers, My Mom's Best Meal, Getting in the Theme of Things, and Super Snacks and Appetizers. Arguably the best part of this magazine is their clip-and-keep section of recipes which feature color photos of the dish. Just cut out the recipe, and ouila! it's ready for your recipe box. ---  --- Other information-packed sections include Ask Our Food Editor, Touring Country Kitchens, Ted's Toothpick Contest, Lively Leftovers, and more. Each issue also features a recipe contest to win cold, hard cash.  ---  --- Some of the great recipes that are in the most recent issue include: ---  --- Swiss-Stuffed Porkchops --- Open-Faced Turkey Tacos --- Spinach Shrimp Fettuccine --- Coffee 'n' Cream Brownies --- Cucumber Potato Salad --- Asparagus Chicken Crepes --- Hearty Jambalaya --- Barvarian Strawberry Pie ---  --- and many more. Besides being tasty dishes, one of the great things about the recipes in Taste of Home is that they don't call for some exotic ingredients. Rather, they feature ingredients that can be found in any department store...even if you live in an out-of-the-way rural area! ---  --- Some of the recipes aren't exactly "quick", which is why I give it four stars. There are certainly quite a few quick and easy recipes, but there are also some that take quite a bit of prep work. If you're looking for a magazine with mostly quick recipes, try their sister publication, Quick Cooking (I subscribe to that one, as well...and actually like it better.) ---  --- Taste of Home has NO ads (amazing!), so it's nice that the magazine is chock full of recipes and information--not fillers and ads. This magazine also is very "country", so if you're looking for something trendy and cosmopolitan, this mag may not be for you. But if you like down-home country cookin', you'll likely love this magazine
"Better Homes and Gardens" has been a staple in our home for years. This essential magazine seems to always be there for you. When I think about it I would say that it has enriched our home and ultimately our lives. Its very visual style of lending ideas for enhancing our domicile and our surroundings has always been simple yet effectual in enriching our lives
TurboTax has what looks like it would be a geat feature -- the ability to import data from your financial institutions so that you don't have to enter all of your stock sales by hand.   ---  --- Some of the cost basis (how much I bought the shares for) was empty, so I had to go in and enter them manually.  No big deal, just took a few minutes. ---  --- However, when I went to e-file, the program had flagged these changes as "overrides" to computed values, and refused to let me e-file the return.  Equally bad is that if I just leave the fields empty -- as they came from Charles Schwab, then it looks like I got the stocks for free, and have a huge tax bill (that is incorrect).  ---  --- So, after many hours of trying to see if I could change the field so that it would not be flagged as an "override", I determined from other upset users of TurboTax in the forums on intuit.com that I was out of luck.  I'd have to print it out and mail it in. ---  --- As a special reward, TurboTax doesn't even tell you what attachments you need to include on the return that you are now forced to mail in.  The help screen says that what it prints out will tell you what to include in the return.  That's wrong. ---  --- So, the main reason I got TurboTax was to e-file.  Now, I get to print it out, find out all of the crap that I have to attach to the return, mail it in, then wait for weeks to months to get my return. ---  --- Thanks, Intuit!!!! ---  --- The saddest part is that H&R Block had sent me a free copy of TaxCut before I bought TurboTax.  I should have used that before I spent $30 on a piece of crap like TurboTax.  Won't do that again
I was very disappointed in the quality of this DVD.  I would not recommend anyone buying this DVD until the quality is back to that of a professional recording
Great if you are serious with your kickboxing or any other martial art pad drills or sparring even!   Wrap easily and securely - nice and snug - real leather - soft but good padding and supports inside. Great wrist and fist supports upon impact!  I'd buy them again.. Need more color choices now.. :
I agree that this is a beautiful product; however, I returned these earrings not long ago. The reason is that there is a half arrow at the end of the hook which is used to lock the earring. I tried to wear them, but the half arrow was too big, and I couldn't get them through my earlopes.  
I began using Gillette's Mach 3 razor when it first came on the market, and was very happy with it (until recently...) The original Mach 3 would give consistently good, smooth shaves, and worked well for about six or seven times until it dulled and began to give rough shaves. That was an excellent product. However, with the introduction of the new Fusion razor, the Mach 3 suddenly became much less effective and the shaves I was getting were much rougher.  ---  --- I had heard about the Fusion and decided to try it instead, figuring may that Gillette was trying to "migrate" its users towards the Fusion by downgrading their reliable old product, putting all their new design juice behind the newer model. I was shocked by what a shoddy, difficult product the Fusion razor turned out to be. I went from getting several good shaves per razor to, well... none. I'm lucky with the Fusion to get two decent shaves per cartridge -- usually it roughs my skin up on the very first pass, and it doesn't cut my beard back right to the skin the way the Mach 3 used to.  ---  --- What's the deal? Did Gillette decide they no longer wanted to provide a quality product? That they'd rather have customers have to buy a new razor right away, rather than have us use the same cartridge a few times before needing to buy another one? If so, that marks a huge change in their corporate policy, from giving us a quality product to basically shoving customers around and trying to rip us off. I know they *can* make a great razor -- they used to -- but if Gillette has decided to stop doing a good job, then forget it. So much for my customer loyalty. I'll either switch brands or stop shaving until there's another razor on the market that provides comparable quality to the old Mach 3
An hour and a half of beautiful men prancing around wearing very little can never be less than watchable, but aside from the nudity and homoerotic horseplay, there isn't much else. Granted, there are a few nicely filmed poignant moments, but it's often dull
The shoes are comfy and of great quality. I wasn't sure if I liked the buckle, but decided to risk it b/c of the great price. The buckle is a nice accent and overall I'm am very happy with the shoes.
Following up on the success of The Chocolate Chip Cookie Murder, this is the second volume in the Hannah Swenson Murder Mysteries.  Here again, we find Hannah coping with the brutal Minnesota winter when the unthinkable happens.  Hannah finds a body!  The local high school coach and secret wife beater is found dead face down in Hannah's strawberry shortcake.  His wife certainly has a motive, but is she the real killer?  The police are inclined to think so, but Hannah certainly does not.  With the aide of her sister, Andrea, she sets out to find the real killer.  Many suspenseful twists and turns follow as Hannah and Andrea proceed on their relentless mission to free an innocent woman.  Will they succeed and find the real killer?  Only in the last few chapters will you find out the answer to this riddle. ---  --- Once again, author Joanne Fluke has surpassed herself with another excellent novel.  The cozy and inviting atmosphere found in the first novel continues here against the backdrop of the cruel Minnesota cold.  Many delicious recipes are included so you can share the experience right along with Hannah and her friends.  Her strained relationship with her mother continues as her friendship with Norman grows and her closeness to her sister Andrea deepens.  The novel keeps you in suspense right up until the very end providing an exhilarating mystery ride.  This is a novel not to be missed.  Very highly recommended. ---  --- Smash 
I ordered these shoes for my wedding, so you can imagine my nervousness.  I received them within a week and fell in love!  I've shown them to my bridal party and my mother and have received nothing but raves!  Even at the shoe repair where I had no-skids put on them and the dress shop where I had a fitting no one could take their eyes off my shoes!   --- Order a 1/2 size smaller
A GREAT PRODUCT FOR DRY SKIN, WITHOUT LEAVING A GREASY FEELING.  NOT ONLY DOES IT MAKE MY SKIN FEEL SOFT BUT IT SMELLS WONDERFUL.
Nothing much to report.  They were as advertised and fulfilled my need
I think some of the reviewers here did not use the program more enough, am using it since version 2 till now as an illustrator this program can't be beated... gradient fill was so stupid to create in earlier versions of adobe illustrator u must create two objects then blend them together to form a gradient fill then you have to mask it within a path or the shape you are filling, one more thing the mask in corel "container" is a wonderful tool to have much better than the mask used in illustrator that sucks (u have to see me pulling out my hear if i made i mistake using it) do you want more i have a lot to mention. ---  --- Am using both program everyday know them very well and to be honest i do all the artwork in coreldraw then i export to illustrator for color separation and printing and that becuase the printers agancies in my country don't know how to use corel so i have to ride the wave and finalize thing in illustrator. ---  --- I do all detailed drawings precisely using the guidelines and grid (first in available in corel) creating layouts, realistic objects or models with shadings and shadowing as well with ease this software is so powerfull if you are a real artist you must get i
My 3 boys (ages 4, 7 and 9) love their lightsabers so the idea of a spring activated version was too hard to pass up.  Imagine the disappointment when the fragile spring/force action is only good for about 3 tries and then it falls apart with no way to get inside and fix it.  We have 3 of them (Darth Vader, Obi-wan and Luke Skywalker). Vader was done before 9am Christmas morning. The other two are hanging on by a thread and now the boys have to be "very gentle" when they load the saber. The worst part is that the light up feature is tied to the spring so it does nothing now.  These are not rough kids and it's just a matter of time before the other springs get jammed.  Stick with the original light up sabers and forget the force action. 
This is one of the most offensive and anti-gay movies I have ever seen.  Don't let the title or the box fool you.  Every character in this movie is oozing with homophobic sentiment.  I was shocked that such a film could come out of France.  If you're a homophobe and want to sit and watch a bunch of hateful people sit around and attack and harass (verbally and physically) a man who pretends to be gay to save his job, then rent this and snack on a can of worms. ---  --- HIDEOUS
Great I love using this product. It goes good with xylitol too
I have used this software for about 4 weeks since posting my comment in reply to that review.  Having now had a chance to use the software, I can only say that I am almost 100% satisfied with it.  Some times, it's nice to have a spanish dictionary when after a few lessons, you still can't quite grasp the concept of the word you're being taught, but other than that... ---  --- Yes, it is repetitious.  For those who want to learn another language, this is to be expected.  No, it's not a magic pill. ---  --- However, in as little as three weeks I found myself largely able to understand what native speakers around me were talking about, even if my understanding of it was imperfect. ---  --- Repetition (as they say) is key, but even if it were not, dedication is absolutely required.  You can only learn if you stick with the program, and even I have been rather lax about that much.  Still, I am wholly satisfied with my purchase.  It is clear to me that the program is only as good as its user though, and I really ought to be more dedicated to following it
This "key hider" wouldn't fool my 18 month old! With a VERY visible seam on the bottom, it's obvious this thing opens. You can practically see the spare key through the cheap plastic! Awful, awful, awful
The first one I purchased lasted about 2 weeks, then sparked and smelled like something was burning and quit working.  Exchanged it for another one - it lasted about 3 weeks - then the same thing.  Have now purchased a different brand.  Would not recommend this product
No free lunch & you get what you pay for...is that the verdict on this product? ---  --- Well, the poor rating given by those who have purchased this product has discouraged me from buying it.  I need disc binders and the Case Logic brand, while being the original, is pricey.  Low cost alternatives are needed, but not at the expense of quality and TCO (total cost of ownership).  But the flap about poor customer service (rebates) and poor quality (zippers and sleeve binding) is enough to give me pause.....  So, if someone from Xtreme's management is paying attention....fix it or be content to lose business.  Price isn't everything to everyone in the markt for your product..
A magazine filled with hot women, movie reviews, game reviews, and nonsense that is sure to make you laugh out loud because of its stupidity. 
Color and image are delightful. I do wish I had gone up a size as I like to wear it with a long sleeved t-shirt underneath
I think it is a great movie. I bought it for my grandson he loved it
Stay away from this seller "Salter".  I ordered this product 20 days ago and finally got an email saying that there's an unexpected delay!  I cancelled right away, after waiting for almost a month
Remember Seagal's movie "Patriot" where he saves the day with flower petals dropped from a plane. That was bad. This one was by far the worst movie he has ever made. With the dubbed in voice (Why?) to the disjointed plot it should never have been released
I saw this on tv and loved it, so i had to buy it
Out of all the loads of baby gear I bought- this is by far the best money I spent.  I thought, its a little spendy, but super cute.  After my preemie came home the 3rd week of November and it was 27 degrees... I realized how great this thing was.  Its super snuggly for her and keeps her warm.  No need for a jacket that would mess up her straps!  also in the wind and the rain, to just be able to flip it over her face is so great!  This is way better that the ones with sherpa inside in my opinion.  My daughter will be able to use it well into Spring.  Not to mention, not a day goes by that I don't get a compliment on the sack and people asking where I got it.  Love it Love it
When I ordered this item I already knew it didn't come with the driver/software cd but minutes after I ordered it DLN sent me an email telling me that I was able to download the software for free from Samsung and event sent me the link. That was nice of them... i'm kind of bummed that that charge feature doesn't work on my phone (D807) but that's just an issue with my phone I guess and nothing with the product.
This is the same unit that HP sells, but has Lite on do its support. Great unit for about a month. Support is not good.
This is a good granola. I like that it has lots of seeds with the grainy things, and a few nuts tossed in. Nice taste. Thanks to Amazon for carrying so many gluten free items! Makes like so much easier!!
I've tried several lumbar cushions from Amazon and this one is the most comfortable, despite being so inexpensive. ---  --- I only wish it didn't have the "wings" on the side
My kids really like the memory cards because they can keep playing there game once they get off andthey save it
Fortunately my brother was nearby when I had a flat.  He pulled the Electromate out of his trunk hooked it up to the flat tire.  In about 20 minutes I was safely on my way to get the tire repaired.  I swore I would buy one, just in case he wasn't there next time, or worse yet, if I got stranded without help anywhere.  The jumper cables are a plus!!  I HIGHLY recommend this item to anyone
This was the best series on television in the late 1980's.  My sister and I never missed an episode.  Yet it still isn't on DVD.  I can buy "I Love Lucy" and "Dawson's Creek," but I can't have all three seasons of my beloved Vincent and his velvet-over-gravel voice.  What the heck gives?  Please put this out on DVD!!
As owner of Every single Chill/Lounge music CD I am aware of, this was the biggest dissapointment in a long time.  Ultra Chill series 1-4 was outstanding.  While Ultra Chill 05 is not a complete disaster, I could not find one song worthy of a 5/5 star rating.  Quite a few 4 star songs and lots of 2-3 star songs.  Some of the better songs were repeated on older Chill discs or present on other series of lounge discs.  There is a lot of Jazz and Latin chill on these two discs, which I also like, but the Jazz/world/latin chill tracks here were repeats or nothing great. ---  --- I think the person that rated this 5 stars doesn't own a lot of lounge/chill and is probably a lot easier to please.  I'm very dissapointed.  Maybe this 'genre' is all dried up! :) Oh well... --- I'm off to listen to "Chillout Seesions 8"... Hopefully it will be a lot better.  I highly reccomend Chillout seesions by Ministry of Sound.  Chillout sessions 1-7 are outstanding... Time to go listen to the new 8!
Someone near and dear to me loved it...and the price was right!  Valentine's Day is coming...it makes a great gift
A scientist is held captive.  He is to perfect the missile.  Only the  scientist knows what to do.  If he is not to do it.  His wife will be  executed.  Also in sub-plot.  A assassin is hired to kill the scientist so  he can not finish his work.  The IMF team has a gaget that might work.  Wil   they rescue the scientist in time.     EN
I wonder how long it will be before Frost's literary stock is devalued as much as it deserves to be. These are trite and banal poems that do not ring true or sincere. Frost seems distant from both his poems and the reader. What he has to say is obvious and unoriginal. How he says it is on the level of a hallmark greeting card at its best; at its worst, it is no better than a limerick. Posthumous revelations about his horrific cruelty to others and his shrewd creation/manipulation of his celebrity image as the New England farmer-poet only confirm that there was something seriously wrong with this man and his poems that an earlier generation missed. How earlier generations could find genius in such obvious observations is astounding. --- Bad poetry from a twisted man
I received this item today and was surprised --- 1) It was shipped from overseas (UK) --- 2) It came with only one CD instead of two like a previous reviewer thought --- 3) No paperwork - it came in a clear case with no artwork, info, etc --- 4) Sonic Foundry sold ACID to Sony in 2003 (according to Sonic Foundry's website) and SF no longer provides support --- 5) I can't get this to register online, which seems a little dodgy, but other than that, it seems functional. No huge library of loops, either. Can't really say I got what I expected
It's a big nasty mess.  As big of a mess and disappointment as Floa
Four stars seem a little generous. The film is certainly memorable, and certainly different. There are a lot of odd things going on here. The oddest is why the central character, Mark Lewis, is so obviously a blond, blue-eyed German. Very strange, this. Is there some weird subterranean comment about the sickness of Hitler's Germany, and how we ought to feel sorry for the perpetrators of his crimes, because of their blighted childhoods? Much of the rest of the symbolism is very heavy-handed, however, as other reviewers have pointed out. It is consistently perverse. The director of the film within the film: "The Walls are Closing In", is played by an actor who was in point of fact virtually blind. He had a bit part in several James Bond films. Is there some message here? Peeping Tom's father, the heartless psychologist, was played by Powell himself. What is this telling us?  Is part of the message meant to be that the camera kills? It doesn't hang together somehow. What's the meaning of the model with half a hideous face? Why is the would-be girl-friend's alcoholic mother blind? Why is the only presence with real star quality, Moira Shearer, playing a stand-in? Much of the premise of the film seems promising, but it is clumsily written, and directed with a leaden hand. In fact, what many of the Powell-Pressburger films seem to lack is any real sense of pace or excitement. It's all a bit tired, and slow. There is nausea, but no shock or thrill. Loco, perhaps, but Psycho, it isn't.
In 1973, director Nicholas Roeg took a Daphne Du Maurier story about a strained family situation, added a child in a red coat and some superlative direction, cast wonderful, talented actors such as Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie, and produced a seminal and classic piece of seventies horror, the unmissable "Don't Look Now". ---  --- Six years later, Cronenberg - obviously, oh so obviously having been influenced by the starkly pared-down imagery and understated elegance of the Roeg picture - decided to put his own markedly different spin on a terribly similar theme, with disasterously boring results. ---  --- To synopsise the plot: Frank Carveth's estranged wife is crazy, and undergoing unconventional therapy at her psychiatrist's controversial institute. Suspecting her of abusing their daughter, he removes her from his wife's care, to the strenuous objections of her shrink. Several people connected to wifey's emotionally crippling past begin to show up dead, and Carveth finds himself fighting to save his daughter from her crazy mother's 'other' set of kids. ---  --- So it's David Cronenberg. So what? ---  --- Performances and direction, as well as screenplay, are all simply mundane. There's barely a shred of the sleek, polished talent we have come to recognise as David Cronenberg, and what we have instead is a sort of mishmash of some of the better aspects from classic American horror movies, as seen through the obviously tired eyes of the writer/director. It's almost got the sense of isolation of 'The Shining', but there are too many incidental characters. It's almost got the same sense of murder-by-numbers as 'Hallowe'en', but lacks the decisive action of that movie. It's close to the stark imagery and sense of motherhood-gone-awry as 'Carrie' (and even the lead actress bears a striking resemblance to Piper Laurie!), but Samantha Eggar's performance is too overblown.  ---  --- Makeup effects, too, are over-ambitious for the time and fail to create any sense of impact or drama, in that they just look silly. Of course, you could say the same for 'The Exorcist', nowadays, but where that film still has the incredible strength of Ellen Burstyn's and Linda Blair's performances, all 'The Brood' has to go on is some deformed alien-figures that hiss a lot. It's not good. ---  --- In short, where a movie matters most, 'The Brood' fails wholly to deliver, instead regaling us with 90 or so minutes of unfulfilling cinema. ---  --- A note on the subtext: It's difficult to feel any sort of respect for the social commentary contained herein. Sure, topics like the state of the Nuclear Family and the negative effects of a Mother's love are riveting things, when handled properly. Unfortunately, when the package and presentation are so obviously hollow and overdone, who could care less about subtext? ---  --- I couldn't.
My daughter recv'd this from her grandmother for her third b/d and i think its alot cuter than in the picture. It has worked fine for my daughter she has figured out how to work it by herself and even has shown mommy how to turn it on once in awhile. she likes playing the cds with her name in them that her grandpa got her for her b/d.  The only thing i did wrong was let my daughter keep it in her room w/o me checking up on her, she went and poured some kind of liquid in the storage compartments so i had to take it away as punishment. I have forgotten about it until i seen this ad which now i think i will get it back out and let her play with it again. I have even played my cds on this while cleaning the kitchen and they sounded fine. My daughter has alot of the princess furniture in her room and this really matched and is very cute, and we have had no problems with this item so far. (knock on wood).
This case was well thought out for snorkeling/diving and using your own digital camera without going to the expense of a really expensive camera.  Definitely a better choice than using those throw-away underwater cameras or renting one.   --- The only drawback is that it triples the size of the great 720SW camera - since size is one of its strongpoint
Great coffee and a bargain when buying it by the 5 pound bag.  California does some things better than us here in Indiana, coffee is one of them
Really neat program and it may be a tad over my head right now.  The tutorial is helping a great deal.  I am positive that I will find all the right buttons
like the product very much. comfortable and convenient.  i would recommend then if: you have a small hat size, don't mind carrying around an odd shaped soft carrying bag.  with the above i don't have a problem.  the most distracting problem is your eyes sweat inside the foam enclosed, goggle like eye pieces on warm days.  i've thought about cutting vents in the foam around the eye, but have not done this as of jan,2007. i like them very innovative
I got this set as a party gift for a sleep-over for my kids. --- They loved it and the price was really hard to beat
When I bought this CD it was for a little bit of nostalgia - Those Were The Days.  Since playing it once when it blew me away with the tracks and the memories, I have played it so often that if it were vinyl it would be worn out by now.  If you liked Mary Hopkins then this is a fantastic selection of her music and well worth a place in your collection
heads up lightening fast..very cute purple*..works great i wonder if they make these smaller as well..ill be looking i love this thing : 
The rechargeable battery lasted for approx. 5 minutes once fully charged.  After five minutes it did not have enough power to allow the air hog to fly. I would not recommend this as a buy.
 I would not reccomend wearing these hose for very long at all. The silicone bands which hold them up were burning my legs by halfway through my wedding day and left me with blisters on my wedding night.
Although this charger is suggested when purchasing the Verizon Razr, the phone complains that this an "Unauthorized Charger" and it will not charge the phone. Do not waste your time with this
i bought it 15 days back and it broke when i am chopping onion.. but its great to cut soft vegetables and even carrot is also good.. but i couldnt cut onions as mentioned.. probably we have to buy the onions from them hahhahaha... i dont suggest buying it for onions.. coz i bought only for onions so that i could save my tears
This is the kind of gift you will give to someone you really, really hate. This thing does NOT shuffle plus it WILL eat up your cards badly. DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE... that is unless you wish to annoy the hell out of someone and have fun doing so. If you do go ahead and spend your hard earn mula on this purchase here are some suggestions on how you can use your brand new Card Shuffler. ---  --- 1. Pet Dog's Chew Toy --- 2. Door Stop --- 3. Play Street Hockey --- 4. Stress Release Stomping Toy --- 5. Mother-in-law Birthday Gift --- 6. Modern Art for Coffee Table --- 7. Nerf Ball Target Practice --- 8. Condom Dispenser ---  --- Kind of think about it, this is a great toy. Have fun! ---  --- PS. If you are looking for a shuffler that really works maybe you should take a look at: Excalibur Professional 6 Deck Card Shuffler; you might like it
I've been using SpySweeper for 2 years now.  It generally does what it is supposed to do.  However, it was nearing time for me to renew.  SpySweeper becomes a huge, irritating nag when it comes time to renew.  Not only does the software bug you all the time, but Webroot sends out reminder e-mails too.  With 3 weeks left on my subscription, I decided to renew, mostly just to get rid of all the nagging.  Well, guess what? - the renewal process reset my expiration date.  Rather than giving me 3 weeks plus 1 year, the renewal starts immediately, and ends in exactly 1 year - which means, that I've been ripped off for 3 weeks of paid subscription.  Maybe Webroot thinks their users are too stupid to notice this deceptive practice of moving up renewal dates.  I've complained to them - and if they don't make amends, then I cannot recommend this product to anyone
I was overwhelmed by the choices, and selected this model, in part, because of the reasonal price.  I had read reviews which mentioned problems and the need to return the product, but I decided there was only a small possibility of that happening.   ---  --- The instructions said to use the lowest setting initially, which certainly made sense.  However, the INSTRUCTIONS said to move the adjustment "toward the tip", which turned out to be the highest, not the lowest setting!  The diagram on the handle indicated that the movement was toward the LARGER opening, but I read the directions and did not look at the diagram until later.  The spray was very powerful and actually "hurt", especially when it was by my tooth with a crown.   ---  --- The next day I tried adjusting the settings with the pik over my sink, not in my mouth!  It felt wonderful on the lower setting!  I reread the directions again (and again over the next several days) to see if the error was mine or theirs.  I still think the directions were not written properly.  The third day I had trouble getting any spray at all.  This continued for about a week, some days getting more or less, but never a full spray ON ANY SETTING!  My guess is that it was in a permanent "pause" mode. I gave up and pursued returning the item.  It needed to be returned to an "authorized repair", which luckily was only a few miles away (there were only three in my state).  The repair man had told me, over the phone, it was a discontinued model and hadn't been made in about  a year.  When he looked at it, he found it had been made in 2006.  He said he could fix it, but wasn't allowed to; I am awaiting a replacement to arrive in the mail. 
Our 21-month old daughter has been using this tub since birth and we love it!  It does hold water and she can splash around and play with her toys.  The sunctions are great since they do stick pretty good to the tub.  Easy to clean and easy to put away when my husband or I need to use our regular tub
Hey can you please tell me when the next platinum timberlands are going to be in stack
I must admit I had no idea what they were, but my daughter wanted them.  --- I was disappointed that all you do is basically rub the pins together to get another color. This color did not last long so you had to keep doing that little process to get the colors to blend.  My daughter who is 7 lost interest quickly.  She uses them like regular markers.  I could have paid 5 dollars for a new pack of markers. As for the material to use them on, she used them all in a couple of hours. 
THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT,"TOP OF THE LINE" NEVER GET LOST AGAIN NO MORE SPAT WITH YOUR FRIENDS, OR OTHERS. JUST GET THE MAGELLAN AND YOU ARE ON YOUR WAY. EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE ONE
I read this book the first time 7 years back and left a lasting impression on me, that's why when i came across it again after so many years i felt compelled to buy it and read again. Oh Boy am i glad i bought it! Since last time i read it i have read many romance novels, many great one and many bad ones too. i thought i might not like it so much the second time around because of all the exposure i have got to romance novels since then but i was wrong. This book still made my heart race, made me smile at Joe's attempts to make Ronnie laugh and still made me sigh at that sparks of atraction flying between them.  --- Joe's character was just amazing, and most endearing was his insecurities.Here was a Navy SEAL,one of the toughest possible guys, and he was insecure about his upbringing and background. He felt Veronica would be ashamed to be seen with a guy like him. He was sooooo sweet. He was so cocky, stobborn and arrogant but he was scared of rejection from Veronica. Just goes to show how a person's outward appearence rarely show what is really inside them. --- i can't find any more book of this series , i am still searching for them. i know i have to read all of them.
Didn't realize how easy and effective it is until now. I can clean a room in a couple of minutes. Definitely worth buying
This product works well, it takes a while to warm up but it can keep my feet nice and warm once it gets going.
Pik Stik reacher/grabber did exactly what it said.  I used the 32 in size to pick up items from the floor and in the yard.  I'm 5'4" and did not have to bend over to pick up things.  It picks up coins, small pieces of paper, as well as jars, and leaves/gumballs from outdoors. I am completely satisfied
This is the worst waste of money I have ever had. the only good thing about this mirror is the suction cups. 3x magnification??? more like 9x !!!  you have to have your face right on the mirror or it looks like you are standing by one of those funny distorted amusment park mirrors. --- My suggestion would be not to waste your money on it. its a joke
This cocoa is gritty and has a bitter taste.  The dark chocolate mint is particularly bitter.  We don't care for the chocolate raspberry and chocolate vanilla flavors either.  The chocolate supreme flavor is sweeter and tastier than the other flavors, but the child in our family still remarked that his cocoa "tasted strange".  There are many non-gourmet commercial mixes that are smoother, more palatable and less expensive than this gourmet brand.  We won't buy this cocoa again.  This gift box selection is very handsomely packaged and looks great in holiday gift baskets. But the cocoa fails the taste test.  
I really like it it's an excellent watch and also a very elegant one
I BOUGHT THIS LIKE A IPOD BUT ITS BETTER I HAVE ABOUT 20 MOVIES ON IT AND ABOUT 500 SONGS AND SOME PHOTO'S AND STILL HAVE 50 GIGS LEFT. THE ONLY HANG UP IS YOU STILL HAVE TO GO PAY ANOTHER 20.00 TO GET THE PLUG-IN DOWNLOAD THAT LETS YOU SHOW MOST OF THE MOVIES. THEY SAY IT CAN DO ALL THIS STUFF BUT NOT WITH OUT DOWNLOADS AND SOME ADD ON'S ONCE YOU GET ALL THAT THERE ARE HOURS OF FUN TO BE HAD.
You can't beat it when all you do is unwrap it and use it!  The cover is a high quality, perfect fit product (odd shape and all) that looks great and fully protects the grill.  I highly recommend it&gt
Small holes, unstable, no space for the bum. My daughter cried everytime we tried it. We had a Pool School deluxe baby float before but we left it at the pool and it dissapeared. She loved that one. I could not find it in the store so I bought the Swim School and am regretting it. --- Buy the Pool School!
I love this stuff.  I have a 12 pack at my office when I can't get out for lunch.  90 seconds in the microwave, and I'm eating
I bought this the year it came out, after seeing George in concert and it is great! Most of these were big hit songs and I found that I really loved the others too especially Hard Day
 --- VISTA is appropriated named.  VISTA defines something great to look at.  If all you did was look at Microsoft Vista it would be the perfect operating system indeed.  Unfortunately Vista is a computer operating system that was designed to be used and there is the problem.  Vista is so secure and so over burdened with layers upon burdensome processor power robbing layer of sheer garbage it is rendered totally completely and utterly useless. ---  --- Vista will take the fastest XP computer and turn it into a slow worthless pile of trash.  Vista is so slow it takes me back to the days when I used to walk away from my IBM AT computer get a cup of coffee and walk around the building.  What makes Vista worse still is Microsoft Office 2007 the absolute pits in word processing.  Add Office 2007 to Vista and you won't be productive at all but dang won't it look pretty. If you just want to watch your computer make pretty colors and areo-glass catch yourself some goofs watch Vista.  When you want to work and be productive turn on your XP computer.  Windows 2000 and XP work hard while Vista Hardly Works at all.  Vista is garbage don't buy this dreck! ---  --- Everything you try to do on Vista is not allowed.  Almost every peice of equipment you run on Vista needs to be updated to so called Vista friendly versions.  The messed up Windows explorer to the point to where it is beyond useless.  The problem with Vista is that Microsoft had taken all the wizards and helpful features far as they could in XP.  In Vista they had to try to top a operating system that pretty much did what you asked of it with little fuss.  In Vista the software code writers were just changing things because they could.  Vista makes nothing better or easier.  In fact Vista is built in a manner that almost seems to go out of its way to make even the most simple compater related tasks unpleasant needlessly long boring and tedious. ---  --- In a word TEDIOUS IS THE BEST SINGLE WORD TO DESCRIBE MICROSOFT WINDOWS VISTA.  VISTA HAS SUCCEEDED IN BRINGING THE ENTIRE COMPUTER EXPERIENCE IS PAINFULLY NEW LEVEL OF THE PURELY TEDIOUS THAT HAS NOT BEEN DREAMT OF BEFORE!  I just wish I could give Vista no stars or more honestly a negative star rating.  I won't be buying Vista for my current systems and even when I get a new computer I will not be using Vista is it comes pre installed.  I have my own old trusty XP disks and I will reinstalled XP the last useful usable operating system Microsoft made. ---  --- XP is the goofy kiddie skool like interface is ugliest operating system Microsoft ever made but while it was an ugly duckling it did work pretty well.  Vista is by far the prettiest operating system Microsoft has ever made but it is pretty and dumb.  Vista is over burdened with programmatic junk has a way to high opinion of itself.  Vista is so much more secure because all the dumb security features make the operating system unusable.  Any computer you make unusable is the most secure because you can't do any productive work on it.  Vista makes your computer experience endlessly tedious and makes your computer system a must see door stop.  The philosophy of Vista seems to be that a good computer should be seen but never productively used.  Vista is a great system for that  well monied executive that wants to look busy while doing nothing productive
This was nothing but a cheap piece of masonite board that you can have cut for about $5.00 at any hardware store. It cost me a total of $23.00 after shipping for this product. It doesn't even look like the picture. It isn't black with Angelcare written on it. It is literally a normal, brown piece of board. It's blatant false advertizing. I feel sick, not to mention a total idiot for thinking I would actually need this particular board to go with my monitor. If you have the Angelcare Movement Sensor monitor and don't have a flat bottomed crib then all you need is any old piece of wood or thick cardboard. Do not buy this. It is a disgrace
This book is a gem that is filled with ideas from many of THE BEST speakers in the world. What a great resource! It is my favorite book now for ideas on how to be more "impactful" in my message to the audience.  This reminds me of one of my other classic favorites, Think and Grow Rich.  I'm ordering another copy for a friend today
This is the worst purchase I have made from Amazon or anyone else. The "first" unit arrived with several parts broken and the tread immovable. After a number of calls to tech support, it was decided to return and replace the unit. Amazon promptly replaced the treadmill. This one had a movable and usable tread but the electronic display did not function. My friend at tech support did not have a clue. He suggested that he send me all the electircal cables used on this unit. It is not clear what I am to do with them. I strongly recommend that anyone wanting a manual treadmill puchase it from a diffrerent manufacturer
I bought this bundle me in Nov and it did not even last 2.5 months.  The zipper broke.  It is not well made.  Stick with the other bundle mes.  The urban bundle me is cheaply made.  Not worth the pric
I encourage many to stay away from this usb product; like previous reviewers said, just spend the extra money on a better usb dongle. As soon as i got this thing out of its package, i almost snapped the casing off due to its poor construction.   --- The main problem that i have experienced with this product is that although its range is ok(not the 100 meters that it claims), as soon as i go into a room thats only 10 feet away, has doors or walls in the way, the reception starts to fluctuate in and out every 2 minutes.
love love love this scent. i have received many compliments about it. long lasting and definitely addictive. i think its more of a late-fall and winter scent if i do say so myself
I was very excited to get these earrrings for my daughter for Christmas, however upon opening found that one of the front of the earrings was dented.  Now I need to return them.  Other than the dent, they were cute. Even though they were only $25.00, there should be some quality control by the manufacturer
I was really excited about this toy. I was very forgetful when it came to putting my son on his tummy, so I thought this would be a great toy for him to  have some good quality tummy time on. Wrong. He could care less about this toy. The second I'd lay him in front of it he would just roll onto his back. He was five months old when we bought it, and it is just sitting there. He STILL loves his Gymini and he is six months old now. Also, by the third day the aquarium had sprung a leak..which apparently has happened to almost everyone who  has bought this thing. Do not  purchase this toy, it takes up too much space, and it's a waste of money. Baby could care less about it
I had a few of these covers in lilac and sage and i cant use any of them anymore, they all shrank so much when washed that they wont even stay on the contoured pad. i am now using a white cover from especially for baby which fits and washes great, unfortunately dirt shows and it stains easily. and they only have white blue and yellow and my daughters room is purple pink green and white
I ordered two of these. For the first one, neither the firewire nor the USB worked on my iMac G5 (MacOS 10.3.9). A copy would start, and then hang after a while. I returned it and the second one worked using USB, but the firewire would hang like the first one. ---  --- A friend has one that works fine with his iBook G4 under 10.3.
let me just say my girlfriend loved them and then loved m
As a Gene Autry fan, particularly of his Christmas recordings, I was really looking forward to this release.  But...what a disappointment!  I will look over the dropouts - obviously the source tapes have deteriorated - but what happened to the final three cuts?  They are so laden with noise reduction artifacts that they are barely listenable.  And, I know the disc is short, but were the 2 second pauses between tracks REALLY necessary?  Talk about choppy. No flow at all.  ---  --- This CD did make me do one thing...go back into my archives and pull out my original Grand Prix vinyl.  I think I'll be doing a transfer and retire this CD to the bottom shelf.
My kids and I have several backpacking stoves - and we are currently ONLY using the Brunton CRUX... all the others have been mothballed.  The Brunton is well made and very reliable.  It's lightweight and very efficient.  We are able to cook for 3 people for one week using one large fuel canister
I don't keep regular hours. So I don't want a book that goes from say 8 to 6 or whatever. This great Moleskine lets you track time the way you work. You can plan your week and make lots of notes on the right hand side. I love Moleskine. I write a lot with a fountain pen and the Moleskine paper is great for fountain pens. It's the finest paper you can buy. And this is a nice, buttery soft leather book. It's not too small or too large. I keep mine on my desk but often take it from room to room as needed. Or in the car. You can't go wrong with this book. And you never go wrong with Moleskine. It's always worth the extra cost
We were excited to give this to our 5 year old for his birthday.  After opening he loved the design and having his own cool looking notebook computer and was very excitied.  However the screen is very disappointing.  I can't even rate the games because overall I simply just can't see what is on it.  The product is relatively useless in a dark environment and dissapointing.  I should have gone to a toys r us and actually compared the product to other simular products.  I would suggest anyone do the same prior to buying it
This shirt was larger than I expected.  I got a 2x because i'm a 12-14, but it was way too big.  Also the pink was a lot brighter than pictured
Angela Davis stands in my perspective as one of the most accomplished women of the postmodern era. This autobiography draws from her childhood to her young adulthood. Her account of prison life offers an unsentimental analysis of the sexual habits of women in prison. One factor that prevents me from giving this memoir a 5-star is her abandonment of her personal life as a woman. She focuses entirely on the black power movement. In closing, this memoir can offer women the strength to fight injustice but encouraging them to first empower themselves
I have been using Source of Life Energy Shake for many years.  I recommend one scoop in 8 oz. of orange juice or milk twice a day.   Basically, I pour the milk in a shaker cup and put the scoop on top, close the shaker and shake for a few seconds.   This stuff tastes great and has loads of healthy vitamins, herbs, minerals, and more!     A few months ago, I actually used this drink to cut down on my Starbuck's daily double shot of expresso!   Guess a Source of Life Starbucks Latte would be great, maybe I'll try that someday!  This product deserves more than 5 stars and it is absolutely a great product in every way.   If you are looking for a healthy energy drink that tastes good, you have found it
i like how the people on here who turn to sarcasm when rating this cd think they're funny.  heh, so witty.  anywho i'm not a big fan of fall out boy, but there are a couple of good songs on this cd........notably grand theft autumn and saturday.  those are really the only two that hold up its rating for me tho...2 stars
ANOTHER HYPROCRITICAL NUT. THESE CHRISTIAN FUNDAMENTALISTS LIKE  ARE LITERALLY SCREAMING JESUS,WHILE CUTTING YOUR THROATS, NOT UNLIKE THE JIHADI FUNDAMENTALISTS. THE ONLY THING IS THEY CANT DO THAT NOW  AS  THEY USED TO COUPLE OF HUNDRED YEARS BACK BY ENSLAVING AND LYNCHING BLACKS,KILLING NATIVE AMERICANS,AND SHOWING THEIR CHRISTIAN LOVE FOR THE JEWS- BY EXTERMINATING THEM. HOPE OUR FUTURE GENERATIONS DONT HAVE TO LIVE IN A CHRISTIAN SAUDI ARABIA. THIS IS WHAT THESE WHACKOS ENVISION
This CD should have been called "The Most Annoyingly Overplayed Songs of the 1990's." With the exception of "Shine," every single track on this CD is juvenile, mindless, fluff that was overplayed on the radio in the radio until you were ready to scream! If you're looking for a CD that represents the greatest music of the 1990's, check out Non Stop 90's Rock or Forever 90's instead.  --- However, you might be interested in this CD if you want to host a cheesy 90's dance party. The songs are kind of fun and catchy if you listen to them in moderation
This bike may be cute, but it tips over too easily.  My daughter was on it for 10 minutes and she tipped over several times, then would not go on it. I returned it to the store, after reading on this site that it is obviously a common problem with this bike. 
This battery only gives me about an hour of playing time on my Philips PET724 7" Portable DVD/DivX Player. ---  --- After that it claims to have 75% charge left but can't even get the player to turn on and doesn't charge it if it's turned off
Great movie but CD not perfoming in the last few scenes.  It gets stuck or restarts itself.  Very frustrating and more frustrating to have to return new CD
Straps on this shoe are very short and since they close with velcro, they are too short.  I tried to add velcro, but that didn't work.  I had to give the shoes away.  The strap rubbed across the top of the ankle and on the side of the foot and were very uncomfortable.  Would not recommend if you are on the heavy side
This creatine works very good on me building muscle,it has no flavor,i recommend it with a good diet!! --- see results in weeks!
This was required reading for my British Literature class. It's the only novel in the class that I struggled with and only struggled from boredom. It is entirely possible that I just do not understand the genius that is Forster, but I did not enjoy this novel. A lover of Forster or Modernist writing might enjoy it more. It must be a classic for a reason.
I bought this item for $40 online and then found out my Canon Camera didnt need a Cannon brand charger and I could have bought one for $10 instead. In total I spent for this charger which included the shipping and handling. Not worth it. Go to another store and by one for $10
Unfortunately, this book is the sign of what passes for humour these days. Even though it may have been remotely funny (sometimes the author comes close to being bearable), the book never actually tries to be.  ---  --- Humour is supposed to be smart. However, this book gives us the worst case of dumb
"Con Express" has lots of action in it, which is great because this hides the poor writing and uninteresting characters. Unfortunately, the action isn't enough, and in between stunt pieces and shoot-outs, the audience is tempted to doze off. City Heat Productions isn't really known for producing films of the highest quality, so usually I go easy on them. If this were a big-budget company producing this, I'd be inclined to pan it entirely. But I wasn't expecting much and got a little more than I bargained for. The action is, for the most part, pretty good but nothing competitive with your usual dumb action movie. Flanery and Vosloo are perfectly casted, but everyone else seems to stiff to add any more flow to the movie. Vosloo especially appears to be enjoying himself as an over-the-top bad guy hijacking a train containing deadly chemicals. The film moves fast and contains shades of better movies like Under Siege 2, Con Air, Spy Game, and Speed. If you liked those, you probably won't mind this one too much. Just go easy on it
My son LOVES cars and trucks so this looked like it would be a big hit, but like the other reviewers, we have had to put this toy away because of all the injuries.  He used the handle to push it, but the toy is unbalanced, so any pressure on the back causes it to flip up and hit him in the face.  He's had several big bruises and one cut lip.   ---  --- Since posting this, I've spoken to a rep for Little Tykes. She said they would look into this toy a bit more and sent a replacement toy for my son to play with until he is able (if ever) to use the dump truck again. If you've had a problem with this truck, please call them so that they can get it on record
These taste like "real" carrots, and not the things that have been sprayed with who knows what and grown wherever.  I buy these all the time since they never seem to last long in our house.  They are particularly nice dipped in ranch dressing with bacon bits, and just have a sweeter flavor.  When kids are grabbing them all the time instead of cookies, well, then I guess that's all you can say!  Highly recommend
I am disappointed with this product as I thought I was ordering the stretchout strap which is all nylon and very durable which I give to my patients. This one is made of nylon and elastic. The stitching broke within 2 days of minimal use. The elastic may be more comfortable on the hands but the stitching is poor quality and just fell apart. Go with the Stretch Out Strap which I have been very pleased with
I haven't purchased one of these, but I'm curious if this is as reliable as as a traditional set of jumper cables?  Or are there some jobs that jumper cables will do that this will not.  Also, how long does it take to jump start a car? Thanks in advance
This item is BR1500, which also called RS model vs. the BX1500 called XS models.  External battery BR24BP can be used for both BR1500 and BX1500.  The capability to connect external battery is great, since that can help reduce the downtime when California experiencing "rolling black" in the summer. ---  --- There are basically 2 differences between the Back-UPS RS(BR1500) and the Back-UPS XS (BX1500) models besides their names. ---  ---  --- 1. The Back-UPS RS models have both 1-line 2-wire phone/fax/modem data-line protection and 10/100base-T ethernet protection, where as the Back-UPS XS models only has 1-line 2-wire phone/fax/modem protection. ---  --- 2. The Back-UPS RS models have both Boost* and Trim** as features of Automatic Voltage Regulation (AVR), where as the Back-UPS XS only has Boost. When the input voltage increases above the high transfer point of a Back-UPS XS model it will only go to battery. ---  ---  --- *AVR Boost: The UPS is compensating for a low utility voltage. While the UPS can run in this mode indefinitely without any negative impact on the UPS, the circuit should be checked by a qualified electrician if the utility voltage is consistently low. ---  --- **AVR Trim: The UPS is compensating for a high utility voltage. While the UPS can run in this mode indefinitely without any negative impact on the UPS, the circuit should be checked by a qualified electrician if the utility voltage is consistently high.  ---  --- BX1500 does not have the AVR trim feature, when AC line voltage is higher than spec, it will switch over the battery power till the line voltage drops into the spec range. ---  --- Please note this is called "backup UPS", not the "smart UPS" line.  Backup UPS does not produce pure sine wave. When power lost, it will take some milli-seconds to switch over to battery power.  "Smart-UPS" produces sine wave and the output AC was from DC source all the time. When AC input lost, the AC output will not have any interrupt. ---  --- For most computers, the "backup-UPS" is good enough, since the power supply inside PC always have capacitors that can hold for about 100MS or longer. When "backup-UPS" switched over in about 20MS, the computer will continue operates without much impact.  But for A/V equipment, this may be an issue, especially the output is not pure sine wave.  I would not recommend use this UPS for A/V equipment
I've only used the unit 3 times, and the flip-over trimmer broke when I "flipped" it over to attach to the main clipper head. The plastic attachment for the flip over trimmer is supposed to fit over the main head, that cracked in two, and about 8 pieces scattered on the floor. It's very disappointing. I'm hoping the rest of the unti will perform for longer, I can't seem to find the receipt
We have had this camera for about a year.  We wanted an inexpensive camera but buying this was a big mistake.  The picture quality is terrible and now it is not even working. We have a Canon Powershot A60 as well and have been very happy with the performance.  I would not recommend this Polaroid camera to anyone
I didn't have any trouble with them being too large. I tested them in a battery-operated light string against a no-name, non-rechargeable brand and they lasted almost exactly the same amount of time.
LOOKED GOOD ON ME THIS WATCH BUT I FOUND OUT JUST IN TIME THAT THIS DID NOT CARRY SEIKO'S REGULAR TWO OR THREE YEAR WARRANTY SINCE IT IS A GREY MARKET WATCH. HAVING READ THE MANY COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS SEIKO MONSTER I DECIDED I NEEDED A WARRANTY. SO FOR THIS SIMPLE REASON I HAD TO RETURN IT TO AMAZON RIGHT AWAY AND AM IN THE PROCESS OF EXCHNAGING IT WITH ANOTHER BRAND THAT DOES HAVE WARRANTY.
I have owned this watch for almost 4 years now with absolutely no complaints.  After going through several cheaper watches to wear at work and on a casual basis I decided to spend a few extra bucks to see if I could get more wear out of one and I am sold on this one.  I work in a facility that deals with chemicals that are hard on watches and I also work with mechanical equipment that is hard on crystals and this watch has held up in my working environment quite well. Because I am not a diver, I am not sure that this is a good diving watch but I do fish and play in the Atlantic and this watch has held up through use in the sand and salt with very little care given to it.  I am still on my first band and battery and the watch still keeps accurate time.  The band is starting to crack a bit but, after what I've put this watch through, I am surprised it has held up this long.  The crystal is a tad bit scratched but the other watches that I have had would have blown apart or would at least be cloudy from the blows that it's taken
I use my hammock about 75% of the year and find it extremely comfortable.  It was bit expensive but I guess in the long run it will be worth it.  I have had mesh hammocks that only last one season.  I think this one is going to last for years
The chip works just as advertised.  I have had no problems with it, it was easily formatted to my Kodak camera, and it stores a huge amount of pictures and video, either about 280 pictures or almost an hour of video.  Great product, I would recommend it for anyone looking for a lot of storage space for a good price
Make sure you do other forms of exercise and good diet habits to compliment this. I like using it when I'm at home and don't feel like going to the gym. I cardio, (running or something) afterwards. It's really effective if your form is correct.
Well for startes this is one of the best cologes out there.  The smell is chrisp and will last a long time.  It is a great cologne for any acasion.  I have many colognes and this one is on the top of my list, very masculine but girls love it!!!!
Initially I had some trouble figuring out the right port to use. But now it works and I've used it constantly for at least 2 years
we have these in those hard to see parts of the cupboard. --- One tap it is on and another it is off. LEDs are the way of the future
i would like to know what kind of a wuss needs to use a stradegy guide for a FIRST PERSON SHOOTER!?  i mean, they're pretty straightfoward - walk forward and kill all the bad guys you see!  how hard is that!?  Halo is an awesome game but it's REALLY not hard to figure out what to do!  i mean you'd have to be a complete MORON not to know what to do or where to go.  it tells you more than once what to do during the game - you got that extrememly annoying Cortana yacking in your ear pretty much non-stop, tellin' ya what to do.  but anyway i'm done ranting at you wusses
I have to tell anyone, who has lower back or foot pain, to try a pair of Merrells.  When you try them on, they feel comfortable, but once you wear them for a week, you'll never wear another brand of footwear (unless you have to).  Most of their shoes need no "break in" time.  I own these in four different colors.  My eldest daughter owns two pairs of these. I own more than 20 pairs of Merrells, I have been wearing these for years.  The cool thing about them is, when you see someone else wearing a pair, it's like you're both in on a secret.  You know, you're walking in heaven
Seinfeld-Season 6 would see the sitcom finally hit #1 in the Nielsen ratings. This was also the season where the storylines became more complicated as Jerry, Elaine, George, and Kramer would all be involved in one caper or another in the same episode. George's parents, Frank and Estelle Costanza, as well as Jerry's parents, Morty and Helen Seinfeld, and Newman are featured more prominently and we also see the debut of several strong role players such as Mr. Pitt, David Puddy, and Kenny Bania. Amazingly, the storylines stayed strong throughout the season as several episodes would become classics. And while Jerry was usually considered the weakest of the four main actors, his work improved a lot during this season.  ---  --- Disc 1 starts the season out strong with the excellent episodes "The Big Salad" and "The Pledge Drive" as well as the hysterical classic, "The Couch." "The Chinese Woman" and "The Gymnast" are also very good episodes, both showing the continuing neuroses of the Costanzas. The sitcom always seems to have great episodes on Disc 2 and this is no exception with "The Soup", "The Switch", where we finally learn Kramer's first name, and "The Race" all being classic episodes. Disc 3 is also top notch, featuring the excellent "The Scofflaw", "The Kiss Hello", and "The Doorman", also known as "The Bro", as well as the two-part "Highlights of 100" episode. Disc 4 starts out with the classic episode "The Jimmy", which earned Michael Richards an Emmy for Best Supporting Actor, the excellent "The Fusili Jerry", and the strong season finale, "The Understudy", which mirrors the Tonya Harding/Nancy Kerrigan fiasco, only with Bette Midler, of all people, playing the victim. As usual, the extras are just as strong as the episodes. The Running With the Egg featurette that shows how an episode of Seinfeld is created is probably the best feature thus far in the Seinfeld series. The bloopers are also very funny from this season, especially the ones from "The Fusili Jerry" episode. The deleted scenes, inside looks, exclusive stand-up material, and the Notes About Nothing are also top notch. Although not quite on the level of Season 4, which was their best season, Season 6 was another great season for Seinfeld as the writing was still top notch and the ensemble cast was running on all cylinders. Highly recommended.  
When I first installed the program I was able to access the images, but since that first time I haven't. My operating system is XP and I don't know if that is the problem with the software. I have since then uninstalled it. I did not think this product was very easy to use
I picked this up with a music order for my 350d - big mistake.  The class came chipped, scratched and smuged; Tiffen filters are of very poor quality. ---  --- Do yourself a favor, like I did, and find your local camera supply store and pick up an optical grade filter for maybe, oh, 10 dollars more.  This Tiffen one was so bad that the scratches made their way onto some shots and ruined an entire day of shooting
 ---  Don't get me wrong..I love the two hard cover books, Real Simple Solutions and Real Simple: The Guide to Organized Living. They are gems. However, the magazine simply betrays it's words. As one rater stated, it seems like the reader is cajoled into buying un-needed expensive products, and my god..the magazine is cluttered with ads and inserts, plus it is very hard to turn the pages and read. I realize ads are necessary, but this is extreme, especially for a magazine that supposedly promotes a less complicated and cluttered life for it's readers
I received the Fresh Roast Plus 8 as a 30th birthday present from my parents, which has allowed me to take my coffee snobbery to an entirely new level!  This model has worked admirably in the 2+ months I've had it, roasting one batch at least every two days.  It's not automatic (there isn't a good roaster that is) and you need to carefuly monitor color, aroma, and "cracks" to achieve a consistent roast, but the coffee it produces is balanced, consistent, and far and away better than anything you can buy in the store. ---  --- The negatives are that it does feel a mite flimsy:  the glass roasting chamber sits precariously on the fan unit and could easily be knocked off and broken.  Also, it only roasts a few ounces at a time -- perfect if you just want to roast enough for your morning cup, but don't expect to be able to roast half or entire pounds of coffee for gifts.  The smoke is pervasive, so it's helpful to roast the beans under your stovetop exhaust fan, lest you set off the smoke alarm. ---  --- Overall, this is an excellent product for the home roaster who's just getting into the world of coffee roasting.  Should the interest take hold a little more, it would be wise to upgrade to a larger capacity table-top drum roaster, or a used commercial machine
When I first purchased the low-budget movie named "Pranks", I didn't really know what to expect.  After all, "Pranks" is a slasher/horror movie from the 80s, a very fertile period for such movies and time period which quite honestly produced some pretty good slasher and horror movies in general...unfortunately, after viewing "Pranks", I can honestly say that this is not one of them. ---  --- "Pranks" is about a group of college kids who are staying on campus over the holidays preparing a building which is going to be torn down I think (herein lies another problem in that it is very difficult to understand what is going on in this movie because the acting is so poor).  Obviously, most kids have gone home for Christmas and New Year's except for this group of kids and one "weird" kid who ostensibly becomes the lead suspect as gruesome murders begin to occur.   ---  --- The murders remain largely unbeknownst to the characters in the movie, so the director and screenplay writer wanted to give the audience information to which the main characters are not privileged.  The plot is decent enough although the execution is formulaic/generic and lacks luster throughout the film.  One of the reasons for this is the pathetic acting we see in this movie, which really overshadows any kind of merit this movie is able to produce as a horror movie.   ---  --- There is no question that "Pranks" is a low budget production to begin with and along with that, there is going to be some subpar acting, but the acting in "Pranks" is borderline-awful!!  It is this acting and poor direction that really makes it difficult for the tasteful horror movie viewer to stay interested.  In fact, the movie comes off very generic in style and substance, and rather predictable and boring.  The only thing that is even remotely interesting are the kills which aren't too bad considering the era in which this movie came out from.   ---  --- The Director does use some weak misdirection to attempt to keep the audience guessing as to who the killer is, but the savy horror movie audience can clearly identify the "weird guy" as a "red herring" as another reviewer put it.  In summary, "Pranks" is a poorly executed attempt at a horror movie which suffers from terrible acting, extremely poor production values and flawed direction.  The result is a dull, boring and weak horror movie with a few decent kills...certainly nothing to write home about.  Also, as a final note, the actor who plays the killer does a terrible job and comes off, in the end at least, like a total wuss
You have listed this battery as an accessory to the camera and now that I have purchased it I discover that this battery doesn't fit this camera. It is listed wrong
Does not work like advertised.  Ball falls way to low and right next to the pole way before you can hit it again.  It may also damage a wood or aluminum bat.  Last time I buy anything before reading the reviews on amazon.
I don't own one yet; But I am buying one this week!  Although I am a diehard amazon customer.  I am NOT buying it here cause LOWES regular price is "half" what it is here.  My friend has owned his for a couple of years & loves it.  I have had some food from it & it was so moist & flavorful.  I'd recommend it, BUT I would probably check around to see if it's cheaper in your area.
I was aniticpatng a riveting documentary... After reading some books on Tibet, I thought this documentary would be especially enlightening. I found it to be slow paced, repetitive and thin on factual information (factual history and an intelligent logical supportable case for the Tibetan side of the Chinese invasion/occupation) and heavy on "experiences and testimonials" of certain Tibetans. The bit about "the American's abandoned us" was un-necessary and somewhat of a turn off. Not that this man felt abandoned (I have the utmost compassion for his experiences), but rather that the editors of this piece opted to include his comments along side the "evil communist Chinese" bits. Overall, this documentary of the Tibetan experience is too heavy on the emotionally charged (I did cry at one point), too repetitive (frankly, it gets boring), and too thin on (non emotionally charged) information.
I was searching for a watch for weeks, saw a picture of this watch and paused. Intrigued  I began to read the specs: alarm, chronograph, thermometer, light, stopwatch, world-time zones and more, what's the catch? $55USD C'mon seriously with all those features is that all? I was still skeptical but when I got the watch & put it on my wrist I was sold. Solid, well crafted, unique sporty/elegant combination. My only gripe is that slight increase in body temperature can give an innacurate room temperature. We can't have the world but CASIO has come close with this price I can honestly say go for it
Our family loves this game and has played it for years.  The tiles on this version are smaller than the original and some might find them difficult to handle.  If you like Scrabble, you will love this game!
I have two penguin humidifiers which I purchased a couple of months ago. For the money I think these are great and simple to use. I did not have any problems with leakage--the key is to make sure that the top is on securely. Also, some minor dripping is to be expected when you take the penguin body off the base--just carry a washcloth with you--no problem. --- Super quiet. I think it is just the right size for a bedroom. Easy to clean and fill. I had tried others (honeywell and vicks) and this is by far my favorite
I purchased two items at $4.99 each.  When I received them, they were marked with store stickers at $1.98 each
I deinstall the product after two weeks of use.  It did not allow me to select Adobe Reader as my default program and was not able to open many PDF documents.  If a document was opened it was often incorrectly formatted for viewing.  Also, the feature to allow editing of the documents in Word or Excel was most often non-functional
I was very disappointed in the content. There were not enough color plates and transparency in the color was lacking. Many of the instructions were used with black and white sketches and plates. Many of Kautskys subjects and scenes appeared to me to be "pre watercolor career" pencil sketches which I recognized. ---  --- Dark somber and sparse in my opinion
When I first received the product and installed it I had a few configuration issues (not unusual) but now, after 8 months of service, they are telling me I need to purchase an upgrade ($69.99) or I will have no virus protection.  I contacted Customer Service (what a misnomer) as no one was available to actually speak to me and the automated system was like one of those automated phone loops you enter when trying to contact any company.  I finally gave up and an now shopping for a newer and more reliable antivirus and protection system.  I did not get a full year of service, got jerked around and have lost all faith in this software package.  I wish any other users good luck
This is about the only mouse I buy, have gone through a couple of them in the past few years.  I just can't see spending alot of money on something thats going to naturally wear out.  This model is one that I find comfortable for the hand and durable in the using.  If you want a good, reliable, comfortable mouse, this logitech is a good choice
I bought the ultra hydrating shampoo, conditioner, and the treatment, oh and also the hairspray.  These products dried my hair out horribly and weighed it down.  I gave it 2 weeks because it was so expensive and after two weeks my hair never has looked any worse!  I have naturally wavy, thick coarse hair and this made my hair unmanageable - like a helmet head.  My hair had no movement, no shine--just made it very heavy and weighed down.  Last night I used a hair purifier shampoo that gets gunk, minerals, etc out of your hair and after that I deep conditioned it with Kerestase Masintense - wow, what a difference!!  Afer blowdrying my hair it was soft, shiny and had so much bounce!  I woke up this morning and my hair was still awesome.  So glad to have my old hair back - I was beginning to think I had a hormone problem or water problem but it was this Ojon product - horrible if you have the type of hair I have.  Good Luck
The Biosafe Thyroid Test is accurate and simple to use. The results came back in less than a week and matched my doctor's results! Thanks Biosafe
I recently purchased this clock and it's a great little clock! The time and temp are cool features as well as the projection which is very cool and useful. The projection (usually on the ceiling) is not too bright to hurt your eyes when sleeping or awakening. ---  --- The only problem with the projection is that unless you have the clock on the side the numbers project upside down. I mean to say that if you have it facing you straight ahead the numbers will be above the clock upside down.  ---  --- The atomic feature was a bit tricky also. I live in central NJ and when setting up the clock for the first time it didn't pick up any signal. After I searched for a signal, took the batteries out and tried everything I knew and everything the manual mentioned it wouldn't get a signal. So I had to write an email to the company and they sent me a response with several suggestions, the one that worked and was most useful was to search for a signal (by pressing the down arrow) and then while its searching place it where it can recieve full signal, which is shown by the meter on the left, like a cell phone. Once you get enough signal let it sit there until it sets itself (you may need to take it outside)...this can take from 10 mins to days. In my case it took about 5 mins. So it set the signal and the company says once it sets you can put it where you want and it will keep the signal. Other than that problem, which is fixed, the clock is hassle free and very easy to use.i highly recommend it. Oregon Scientific was also helpful and I sent them a thank you email stressing that they need to put more signal suggestions in the manual, because if they did I wouldn't have needed to bother email the customer service. Hopefully most people didn't give up that easily and kept trying to get the signal to set if they didn't they may have returned the clock needlessly. ---  --- The alarm is loud enough for me to awaken and the snooze button is useful and on the top so it's can be reached easily in a drowsy stupor. ---  --- Overall it's a cute, useful, and stylish clock.
There are a few magazines about writing serious writers need to read. "Poets & Writers" is one of them. It has a literary bent, but avoids the nose-in-the-air attitude. It is practical and educational, and is pleasingly presented. ---  --- A favorite factor for me are the long feature articles on the culture of writing. In the issue out now, there are two major articles. One is about author Stuart Dybek and his fiction that pulls from his experience growing up on Chicago's colorful South Side. The other is about writing contests, dealing with how ethical they are run, the view of literary judges, and when a writer should considering entering one. ---  --- The secondary articles are as informative and as useful, whether you want to learn about promoting your book, doing online workshops or understand the trends driving the industry. ---  --- Contests, incidentally, are a big part of PW's value. The magazine tells you who won, and which contests/grants are currently accepting submissions. PW is careful to screen which contests are listed, ensuring only legitimate ones make it through the editors. ---  --- The writing itself is interesting. It is not always true that writing magazines are fun to read. It should be, and in the case of PW, everything is engaging. ---  --- PW's design is clean. It looks like what a small press literary magazine should look like. The typography and layout are not pretentious or overbearing, but get the job done. It is never work to read this magazine. ---  --- I fully recommend "Poets & Writers." You will be better informed about writing and writers, just like the titles implies. ---  --- Anthony Trendl --- editor, HungarianBookstore.co
Bought as a Father's Day gift for my husband, who is interested in learning to play.  For a very moderate price, it seems very good value for the money
1) Like others here, my charges do not last more than 5 hours.  The beeping from the parent unit WILL wake you at about 3am every night (unless you leave them on the charger). ---  --- 2) Both of my parent units now (after only two weeks of minor useage) refuse to connect with the nursery unit, beeping endlessly.  "Cycling" them on and off per the prescribed (though not well detailed) manufacturer's trouble-shooting method has done nothing.  Only logical conclusion: the nursery unit has apparently died and is not sending out a signal. ---  --- Also: while they were working I did not really get the hype these units generated.  My home is a very common 1800 square feet of two-story "box" type arrangement.  The static would become unbearable once the parent unit was taken downstairs and (maybe due to a weak or faulty nursery unit from the get-go), the signal would cut out before we even got to the kitchen.  So we either got static or no signal at less than 50 linear feet from the nursery. ---  --- Poorly designed (operator interface, controls, directions and trouble-shooting), poorly engineered (poor reception, enormous static, fast battery drain) and poorly manufactured (apparent faulty parts and lack of quality) product
This is a very clever product.  It's a totally new design for a pen.  Now it probably won't take over the world--the old design is pretty good too. I bought this because of it's uniqueness.  I bought 2, and gave one to my 4th grade daughter and the other kids thought it was the coolest thing.  I had hand surgery last year with very limited mobility, and this would have been great for me then
I was excited to try these because I liked the idea of getting my son something that let him put his legs together.  I am tired of seeing him so bowlegged due to the diapers.  And since I like the other Huggies styles, I was very enthused.  Until I went through 5 diapers, everyone of which leaked.  Leaking of urine was the biggest problem but after a BM came out the legs, I gave up.  I tried everything possible to make these work, but they leak.  Maybe in the smaller sizes, but size 5 on a 22 month old definitely did NOT work.  Also, my son is in 50% percentile for height and weight, so skinny legs were not the problem. ---  --- No more Natural Fit/HugFlex for us
I really do not feel tend skin works as advertised. The irritation to my neck persisted and if anything had only gotten worse after applying as instructed. One good thing is that you if you are like me and have trouble waking up in the morning --- tend skin helps for that! Just take a strong whiff and you'll be alert and ready for your day! 
I purchasese the red ones, and I love them. They really go well with many different colors. I was really pleasantly surprised
Truely speaking, this is a very hilarious episode. Must see for every one
PROS: Very cool toy/model for a 12+ with extra time on their hands. ---  --- CONS: Too many microscopic pieces to count.  ---       Very little room for open play.  ---       Requires extreme caution playing with it because the propeller and other pieces fall apart at the slightest breath.  ---       Not appropriate for under 7, at least.  ---   --- First just let me say that my son loves the Lego Duplo blocks and spends hours creating all kinds of different designs with them. He has been begging for the "big boy" Legos, and I have been turning him down, pointing out the recommended ages on the box, (knowing that I would be picking up infinite numbers of tiny pieces throughout the house for the next 18+ years). The ages they put on the box seem to be purely arbitrary, based on this particular toy. A well-meaning relative decided to bless him with this present on his 5th birthday. (I will be seeking revenge as soon as they have children.) I spent the next several hours constructing this nightmare, which in and of itself defeats the purpose of a building toy, in my opinion. I have no idea where they have the idea that this is appropriate for a 5-year-old, given that it was a challenge for me to put this together. Given the amount of microscopic pieces in this toy, one has to wonder who designs these things and if they have children of their own. So much of it seems purely sadistic. ---  --- When the helicopter was finally assembled (and I warned him that that was the one and only time I was putting it together), my son spent some time playing with it, only to be constantly frustrated by the fact that pieces were constantly popping off, particularly the propeller, and this was with very gentle play.  ---  --- Bottom line, if you have a child under 10, they would probably have many more hours of play if you just bought a lot of inexpensively priced Lego blocks (of various types) that they could make into all kinds of different designs. These expensively priced City lines and the like are really neat once built, but then it's just like a very fragile model. Once you've spent the time constructing it, you really don't want to take it apart, so I'm not really sure why you would buy this over a traditional model. I guess I miss the point.
This shoe transcended all my expectations...the style, color, and fit were all everything I hoped for and more!!!  All this plus a modest price!!
The left palm pad keep peeling, possibly from the uneven heat. --- This make the protection pad a lot less useful than one would --- think, which is most people buy this pack fo
I have an Acura CL TypeS, and I got this steering control when I got a Pioneer AVIC-D2. The unit wasn't too hard to setup, the manufacturer's website is pretty helpful. I did notice that it sometimes is pretty slow to process my steering wheel button presses. Rarely, it also completely ignores them, I have to let go of the button, pause, and press again. ---  --- Even with these little issues, I still like the unit, mostly because I can use my left hand to control the volume while my right hand is reaching for the phone, or whatever else
I just bought this small fountain for my office at work thinking that the soothing sound of water would be a nice addition.  However, after setting it up, I added the water and the waited and waited and waited to hear the cascading sound of water.  No cascading sound.  I added more water -- nothing... I added less water -- absolutely nothing.  The design is built such that the water moves down without making any noise.  It is useless from that perspective... plus, you can tell it is made of plastic so it isn't really that nice to look at either.  I would definitely not buy this again and am contemplating getting rid of it after 1 week of use
I so do not understand all the rave reviews on this book. I read it recently for a book club selection, and let me tell you, If I didn't have to read it, I would have put it down after the first twenty pages, and never picked it up again. I found it to be dark, depraved, disgusting, and depressing! An examination of love in all it forms? Hardly! These characters were just plain goofy. I finally figured it out towards the end of the book, these characters were so miserable because they were lost spiritually. They were looking to other humans to provide them with true love, and that is just barking up the wrong tree. I am giving it one star only for the rich use of language
I've been using Quicken for Windows for years.  Since I recently bought a Mac, I thought I'd switch Quicken over from Mac to Windows.  Forget it!  The Mac version is totally incompatible with Windows, you must export your data and then re-import it on the Mac.  This works OK for simple checking / Visa accounts, but it **fails completely** for investment or brokerage accounts.  If you look on Quicken's support site, they say "Reinvest Dividend, Reinvest Income and banking transactions in an investment account must be *manually entered*"  Hello?!  Like I'm going to manually enter 12 years of investment transactions?  With most major products (Adobe Creative Suite, MS Office), the same files work transparently across Mac and Windows.  Quicken's inability to even import the data, nevermind actually opening it, reeks of incompetence.  Stay away from this product
When you watch commercial children's television, you have to accept the commercials because, after all, the programs are "free". But when you pay to subscribe to Nickelodeon magazine, I don't expect for it so be so full of alluring ads targeting children. These ads appear similar to the editorial content. It seems like 50% of the pages are advertisements! ---  --- I was disappointed and won't be renewing our subscription. Better to look at something from the Highlights magazine series.
First found this concentrate a few years ago in Kroger and took it camping because of its small size. Small size, big on flavor and not too salty. Was glad to find it online, as I can't get it in stores nearby anymore
Great multi pen.  No need to carry a bunch of pens, pencils, styluses.. All in one unit. ---  --- The best part for me is the thickness.  My stylus was so thin is gave me cramps. I can use this with no pain. ---  --- Highly recommended
Really delightful and has stood the test of time.  My recording had a few hic-cups with the lighting in one of the acts.  Music lovely, as were the costumes and scenery Can recommend
Not very pretty but the comfort makes up for that.  I am on my feet all day and used to wear reeboks, nike etc, I decided to try the Crocs and have not gone back !!! Its like walking with slippers on. I have been wearing them for about 7 months or so and just recently tried my tennis shoes again and barely made it through the day. By that night my feet and back were hurting so bad I didnt want to do much but sit down. Right then and there I made up my mind to never go back to tennis shoes again !!!  I do wish they were a little cheaper so I could add all the colors to my wardrobe. Buy them you wont be sorry !! Stay away from the look a likes they are nothing like the original crocs in comfort !
I can't get the software to scan past 30%.  The software locks up when I try to end the scan after being stuck at 30% scan
Lookslike it would be a nice product, but it's only for very small babies up to 12 pounds and 23 inches. My baby is very long and just doesn't fit - wish Target/Amazon would have been more upfront with the sizing
the crocs butter turned out to be a sponge with a light infusion of some sort of oil which you rub on the shoes.  I have used it about three or four times and I don't feel it will last much longer. What there was of it seemed to work well, but it seems rather a waste of money considering the amount of actual use.
If your child likes the Wiggles like my 2 year-old does, then she'll love this keyboard.  Except that there is no volume button, which I consider rude to the parents.  :
This seemingly simple piece of molded plastic was recommended to me by a professional photographer.  Basically it's the shape of an open box that slides firmly onto the flash.  It is small and sturdy enough to stash in your camera bag without worrying about damage.  When used the light disperses more evenly and is less harsh on the subject being photographed. ---  --- The white box is for general use.  Also available are the green Omni-bounce for florescent lighting and the gold Omni-bounce for a warming effect. ---  --- PROS: --- Inexpensive solution for better flash photography. --- A quality product that works. ---  --- CONS: --- Non
We received this as a employee gift and were so excited to have it.  Not only does it not fill anything pass 15 PSI, the 12V cord is very cheaply made where it plugs into your cig. lighter.  The plastic on the tip started to crack after pulling it out.  With the few more times we used it, I the tip completely broke.  At least it comes with 7 year warranty.  Save yourself the disapointment and headache
 Make no mistake; "Chato's Land" is a sprawling, unforgiving environment that offers little water and no reward.  The blistering, sprawling landscape of rock and sagebrush, however, is but a backdrop in this story that shows man at his most ugly of moments. ---  --- Charles Bronson stars as Pardon Chato, a half Apache Indian who is enjoying a drink in a saloon when he is antagonized by an arrogant sheriff.  Chato goes against the sheriff's wishes to leave because of his heritage, and lets his actions speak for themselves, leaving the mouthy lawman dead on the floorboards.  A posse is soon rounded up with a variety of area men, many of them farmers and ranchers.  They embark on a trip to find Chato and avenge the death in town, as well as feed some of their own continual hatred towards the Indians in general.  Greed, Hate and Perseverance battle Logic, Pride and Tolerance as the group soon start battling each other over what they think is right and wrong when it comes to avenging the death of the lawman.   ---  --- A great western film from 1971, Chato's land offers a solid and stoic storyline that is wrought with irony as well as themes of loyalty and revenge.  Charles Bronson aside, a superb supporting cast is experienced as well.  Victor French (later of "Little House" and "Highway to Heaven" stardom) graces the screen as one of the posse members, and with Jack Palance and James Whitmore in tow, its a well rounded cast that never lacks quality in acting despite a somewhat linear storyline. ---  --- Palance plays the part of Quincy Whitmore, a war veteran who understands, and sometimes even respects the Apache's actions more than most.  His arch-nemesis is Jubal Hooker (played by Simon Oakland) who has the "fever" of wanting to see the Apache man hang, even if it costs them lives which could end up coming down to the last man.  Jubal is excellently played by Oakland as a man who is consumed with his own destiny of vengeance.  Loyalties loved and lost, a large part of the movie is very emotional in power and prestige as we experience the dismay of the men as they deal with the battles that rage within their very own camp, and minds. ---  --- With Bronson portraying a cunning, intelligent and yes even ruthless Apache warrior, Chato's Land is a western that is filled with buzzards drinking blood, the dark side of man, and the notion that if you go to battle with someone in their own back yard, you better think twice about who has the best odds, regardless of how many men you bring with you. ---  --- The scenic landscape and the shots taken at night as well as during the scorching hot days are excellent, and the sound quality of this DVD in my opinion is very good if not perfect.  If you want a western that gets dirty but portrays a deep story within, see "Chato's Land"
Disney made its mark as a major studio in 1937 with its first full-length feature film, Snow White and the Seven Dwarves. Ironically, given this early success, Snow White was their only hit movie for the next 13 years. World War II kicked the hell out of Disney's overseas markets. Even movies today regarded as classic Disney - Pinnochio, Bambi, Fantasia - lost money on initial release. Disney eked through by diversifying into training films for the US government, and the South American films that were part of FDR's Good Neighbor policy, etc. - stuff that made back its costs but not much more. By 1948, Disney was in dire financial straits. They had just enough money for one more movie. Walt Disney realized he needed a hit or his studio probably wouldn't survive, and it would have to be what they did best: a full-length animated feature film. Walt said to himself, "What we need is a movie about a girl in trouble. Audiences love that. They loved Snow White." That's what he wanted: a movie like Snow White, but even more so - more comedy, more drama, more magic, more music, more lovable characters. He chose as the basis of his company's Hail Mary pass arguably the most famous fairy tale in the world: Cinderella. ---  --- Disney didn't have the money, as they had on earlier films, to lavishly storyboard every scene. Thus they hit upon the wonderfully clever idea of shooting the entire movie in live action, then the animators used stills from that as storyboards. The photos used survive to this day, and many are provided as a Special Edition "extra." In some cases these photos have the animator's drawings over them, turning for instance an almost bare stage into a hall in Cinderella's family chateau. ---  --- In 1950, Cinderella was released and was everything Disney so desperately needed. Even today, Cinderella is arguably the best movie Disney's ever made. It's just awfully hard to argue with any aspect of this film. The animation artwork was a product of Disney's famous "Nine Old Men" - at that time not yet old. Cinderella pulls off, superbly, something not particularly easy to do: it integrates believable human characters with funny cartoon animals and makes it work. From Eric Larson and Marc Davis' beautiful and graceful Cinderella to Ward Kimball's wonderful Jaq and Gus-Gus the mice and over-the-top Lucifer the cat, everything flows together so well it all seems perfectly natural. ---  --- Part of Walt Disney's plan to out-Snow White Snow White with Cinderella involved its music. He very consciously wanted Cinderella to be a source of hit songs. There had been hit songs from Disney films before ("Heigh Ho" and "Whistle While You Work" from Snow White, "When You Wish Upon a Star" from Pinnochio, etc.) but they'd been almost accidental. "Oh, we have a hit song, well that's nice." For Cinderella, Disney for the first time went to Tin Pan Alley (28th Street in New York City where the professional songwriters could be found). Disney wanted his girl's music done by the very best craftsmen, the guys who wrote hit songs for a living. The Cinderella soundtrack hit big (a #1 album with 3/4 million units sold) with songs even today considered quintessential Disney, most notably "A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes" from the movie's opening scene, "The Work Song" while the animals help Cinderella clean the house and simultaneously build her ball gown, and "Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo" (nominated for an Academy Award as best movie song of the year) from the Fairy Godmother transformation scene. ---  --- For their best movie, Disney apparently spared no expense producing the DVD. Not only has the picture quality been digitally restored, but the audio has also been cleaned up with a new 5.1 surround sound mix. Totally gone is the background hiss associated with so many old movies. (Cinderella has the distinction of being "the noisiest movie ever restored" according to its audio crew.) The original mono soundtrack has also been spruced and is provided as an option for purists. ---  --- A word about the movie's aspect ratio (i.e. how wide the picture is compared to its height). The DVD cover says Cinderella is presented in its "Original Full-Screen Aspect Ratio (1.33:1)". This is untrue. Virtually all sound films until 1953, including Cinderella, were 1.37:1. Since a TV screen is 1.33:1, you don't lose a lot when the original is "formatted to fit your television." I just wish they hadn't lied about it. ---  --- Cinderella ends at breakneck pace: we go straight from her foot sliding into the glass slipper to the wedding to Happily Ever After, bing, bang, boom. Walt Disney believed "Audiences like a happy ending, but they don't like a happy ending that goes on too long." Hey, who am I to argue? Well, maybe I'll argue. A DVD extra addresses scenes originally planned for the movie but not actually used. One of these would have occurred after the fitting of the glass slipper and before the wedding: Cinderella is taken by the Grand Duke to the castle in her normal everyday clothes; the first time Prince Charming sees her since the ball she's not wearing a lovely gown, she's wearing her scullery maid outfit. Cinderella is frightened, how will he react when he realizes she's not a fine lady but a poor servant girl? And of course he doesn't care how she's dressed, he loves her anyway. I can **see** that scene in my mind, it would have worked beautifully. This is the one way in which an almost perfect movie could have been even a tiny bit better
My husband bought me this camera for my birthday in May 2006.  I loved this camera.  Well, it stopped working on Christmas Eve.  I used it that morning with no problems, put it on the charger to recharge for later that evening.  When I removed the camera that evening, the screen remained black.  It would not take any pictures. --- After talking with the customer service folks, I sent my camera in for repair.  It was under warranty, and I had not done anything to break the camera.  Well, they voided my warranty stating that it was "Impact Damage" and my repair bill was $111.00.  You have got to be kidding.  I called to question the voided warranty since I had not dropped the camera.  The technician I spoke to explained that "Impact Damage" could happen if the camera bumped up to something in your purse.  So I asked to speak to a manager. --- I am sorry, but if I am going to spend this much money on a camera, I expect a little better quality.  I have called and email the Kodak Company several times to have someone talk to me.  Nobody has bothered to return either my calls or emails. --- I would SERIOUSLY think twice before spending money on a camera that can break by no fault of your own only to have the warranty voided and billed an amount comparable to a brand new camera.  I have discovered that the quality of a product is only as good as the company that will stand behind it.
I purchased this towel warmer for my wife.  She has been very disappointed.  It simply does not get hot enough to heat towels so she has stopped using it.   I would not recommend it to anyone.
This product has worked great with my 2Wire Gateway modem from AT&T Yahoo. ---  --- The real plus has been the USB connection so its not necessary to take off the desktop's back panel.  ---  --- The connection has been good, and I set it up in minutes. ---  --- I tend to think that people who are having connection problems have a problem with their router, and not this device.  I can see 50%+ networks from all over my neighborhood
Jeff Beck is the best guitarist on the planet and has been for a very long time. --- What you get here is an abbreviated version of him live. --- His song selection is not the best, but Freeway Jam which is one of my all time favorite Beck songs is included. --- You also ger Scatterbrain and Blue Wind. --- She's a Woman the old Beatles song is also included. --- Jeff Beck at this time was playing some of his best guitar and his solo instrumental career was taking off. --- The songs with the Jan Hammer Group to me are very average and infact distract what Beck is trying to to. ---  --- Unfortunately this is his only Live album from his instrumental era. I truely wish he would release a DVD of himself in concert for those who either havent seen him live or would like to see him live on DVD. --- The idea was good, the Cd is too short and not up to snuff
Set in a German village reminiscent of Grimm's fairy tale world this book will quickly have readers under it's spell.  This tale within a tale within a tale concerns a young clockmaker,Karl, who needs to create a figure for the great clock of Glockenheim to mark the end of his apprenticeship.  Time is running out for Karl and he is fretful because has not yet made the figure. At this same time Fritz, a young storyteller is telling his latest spooky tale to the villagers.   Fritz launches in to a very mysterious tale of a prince, who it is disovered at his "death" is actually kept alive by clockworks rather than by a heart.  Also in Fritz's story is a stange man named Dr. Kalmanius.  When this highly unusual man is described by the storyteller an identical man suddenly appears. The stunned audience quickly leaves.  As the others leave this strange man  approaches Karl and presents him with the needed clock figure "springing" Fritz's tale alarmingly to life.  As always Philip Pullman creates a vibrant and engaging cast of characters who will leave an imprint on the reader's memory. The illustrations by Leonid Gore capture both the fairy tale spirit and the horror under the surface.  This is a quick but original and engaging read that will appeal to both horror and fairy tale fans.  Don't miss it
This is *awesome* soup!! I was a little iffy about it (about any soup coming from a can or bag!) but ordered it anyway, it sounded so good. My hubby, toddler and I *love* it and could eat it every week if we had more money to buy it!  We took some on a camping trip and shared with all of our friends that we were with, and everyone agreed how great it was. Not as good as home-made, but really really good!  I'm not sure about the taste buds of the reviewer that gave it 1 star, but we all thought it was worth getting again..!
I got my Adidas Adissage WHT/PNK sandals in record time. I was able to take them on my trip with me as intended. Also, the price was the best that I had seen on the internet.
This product helps you copy anything on your computer to your nokia phone.I love it to death and use it almost everyday.Eforcity really did a good job shipping it to me and I completely want more bussiness with them
This works great on short and long hair and you can use wet or dry. I have long hair and I love using this product. It works great for those evenings after a long day and you want to give your hair new life. Fantastic
Another lense jam problem. The lense cover accidentally slide open in my pocket, and the lense extended and jammed. This happened frequently with my old Powershot S30 but never caused a problem.  ---  --- Canon said the warranty is void because there's a tiny dent on the front and back. They said ANY physical damage voids the warranty. I complained that the camera has an all metal body which dings easily. They gave me 20% off the repair
I originally bought this monkey on vacation.  I showed it to my son and he grabbed it and hugged it.  How could I not buy it for him doing that?  It was so soft and cuddly and the feet are like beany babies.  I eventually ordered a 2nd one from Amazon for my parents house.  So now I don't have to drag it from house to house.  As he gets older, he is liking it more and more
We bought this stroller not only for jogging but also to use at places like Disneyland.  The swivel wheel makes this stroller the easiest thing to steer and our kids love it.  Our kids our three and one, both fit in the stroller comfortably.  The only draw back to the stroller is it does not have a cup holder for the parents
This cd its just horrible, they sold only 10,000 copies enough to pay for their instruments lol ! There are better bands than this an example is bleeding through so i think no one cares about a re release peace out
I just got this turner and it feels really nice in my hand. The grip feels very comfortable and the turner has a very nice solid and balanced feel.  I got this turner so it would work better with the cast iron griddle I got. I tried out tonite cooking burgers and it felt easier to flip the patties than a normal cheap spatula. I felt like a short order cook! 
Very nice product. The retractable cord keeps it out of the way and it extends out far enough to use the phone. My complaint with all Palm chargers is that the weak point is at the connector and they break. But the price on this one is good enough that you should buy 2.
I am very pleased with the product - I had trouble with my system and Microsoft tech support was outstanding on helping me solve the issues
Wonderful grill.  Everything we expected.  Shipping a problem. Showed up a week late.  Sat at home for three different delivery dates before the shipper finally showed up.  Grill was slightly damaged - we elected to keep it rather than start the shipping hassles over again.  Not sure the money we saved buying through Amazon was worth it
I also bought this magazine sight-unseen and I wish I hadn't.  For re-decorating purposes, I found this magazine to be not useful at all.  The homes and gardens are pretty, but what they feature (furniture, wall and window coverings) just would not go with the middle-class home...way too opulent.  I was wanting more of a magazine that could give me a look that can be found in local or chain furniture stores... not that would try to make me get a one-of-a-kind table from XYZ Antique store in New York.  Also, I found this magazine text-heavy.  All in all, an OK magazine for a professional decorater maybe, but not for a average home-owner trying to redecorate
All I can say is DO NOT buy this [...].  I just got this stuff and used it for the first and LAST time.  It smells horrible.  It left a wax like film over my hair that was so bad I could not even get a comb through it.  I had to wash my hair (with a different product of course) at least 6 times to get it back to normal again...........WHAT A COMPLETE RIP OFF!!!
Very nice piece, just beware of the size, it's much bigger than it appears in this picture. ---  --- It does hang nice on the silver cord, however, the clasp is backwards, and with the cord, it does not flex to the correct position. 
I've had Norton Anti-virus since 2002 on my 2002 Dell machine which meets teh program requirements.    Its gotten so slow as to be really annoying to use. --- It takes 30+ seconds to open a 2 page word document.  When Norton is updating the virus file, the machine slows to a crawl, instead of downloading quietly (and a bit slower) in the back ground ---  --- Its slowed the machine to such a great extent that we don't use sleep mode anymore because when the machine is woken up it can take 10 minutes on a DSL to update. ---  --- Its so slow that I am trying Kaspersky 6.0.  I don't know if thats better or worse, but since I don't go to "dangerous" sits or perfom lots of downloads its got to be better than teh current state. ---  --- The way I look at it - with Norton Anti-Virus my machine functions 100% of the time as if its being slowed by a virus.  Anything is bette
Video game magazines have been all the rage in our lives. Yet there are just so many of them that tell different stories for different video game systems. That has been the case with one of the biggest-selling ones of all time, Gamepro. They truly have made it one the most provocative and well in-depth magazines with detail about what games are popular according to their writers, and what upcoming games and systems are all in the works. The magazine is quite well, but I honestly do wish they could try to publish more in the way of codes and helpful hints for several games for Gamecube and Game Boy Advance, when most of it primarily focuses in on Playstation 2 & Xbox. Yet, Gamepro really handles itself as a very deep gamer's magazine. Anybody who wants to be enjoy the field of video games, this magazine is worth reading. ---  --- Overall: B 1/2
Great product, arrived in good condition.  Shipping cost made it unlikely for me to order it again
the alarms don't pay any attention to the settings in sounds and notifications. they repeat twice and then quit. the light doesn't flash except the first time. half of the time they don't work. i sent it back for repair and they didn't do a thing to it but send it back to me the next day. same problem, it is the way it is designed but they won't admit it
Mail Fraud,I believe its called!! texas shirt company if this is a real company never had this item to sell. I'm surprise Amazon.com is even associating with them..and mike to get this bent out of shape over a $12 dollar item you need to see someone to address your anger issues.
My husband and I both love to cook, and some of our new favorites come from this magazine.  The reviews are informative, the recipes taste great (and are not overly complicated), and the basic cooking suggestions are helpful.  The magazine likes to pick a theme for the month (or several) which has a couple of benefits.  1.  You can cook a meal right from one issue and it all tastes great together and 2.  You have several options for one basic idea.  For example one month there was a whole article on rice pilaff which starting with the basics (so you could modify the basic recipe your own way) and then gave several variations.  Best I have found out there so far
I wanted to respond to the other review.  If you choose to purchase window coverings from this set instead of making them or getting them elsewhere, please know that the curtains are a darker stripe (not the tan plaid).  But they do match the ruffle on the diaper stacker, the border on the wall hangings and quilt, the trim on the hamper, etc.  It is not as if there would be this one item with an odd color or pattern
Sorry I couldn't come up with a better punchline, but this movie doesn't deserve any original thought or ideas.  Maybe its because there aren't any original ideas in this movie event.  National Lampoon used to mean funny, now its french for crapola.  Avoid this one at all costs!!!  Watch Caddyshack II, Airplane II, yes even Xanadu three times each before you pick this booger one
After months of searching, I found the out of print cd here.  I had never heard it, but after hearing the fabulous song "My Only" from the "Good as it gets"  movie soundtrack, I had to hear the album.  What a disappointment!  Oh well, it would have been hard to make a cd as good as that song
these make meals a lot more fun for children...i know my son loves them
this battery is not compatible with my verizon samsung a670. when you put it in, it reads "bad battery" on the screen and will go no further
The restoration of a Vivaldi opera must be a commendable effort specially if filling in big voids and rebuilding major missing parts of the masterpiece. Motezuma is such an example where ample musical and artistic license was taken to bring it to life. Like restoring a canvas where not only the colors and forms had faded but also sizeable parts were ripped off and lost, reconstructing Motezuma presents the challenge for the restorer of thinking and dreaming, and becoming as inspired as Vivaldi. In listening to Motezuma, one can pick up the original Vivaldian compositions from the reconstructed material as clear as looking at a combination painting part Picasso part Michelangelo. As much as such painting can be taxing to the eye, portions of this opera can be as disappointing to the ear. Except for several arias and the two sinfonias, the music has a touch and taste of the 1800's, but not of the baroque settecento. The juxtaposition of the restorative style is also distractive, and just does not work. It makes at times the orchestration devoid of the Vivaldi unf , charm, and texture.  ---  --- Nonetheless, Motezuma's musical beauty can be found in great arias such as D'ira e Furor Armato, La Figlia Lo Sposo, Gl'otraggi della Sorte, D'ove La Figlia?, S'impugni La Spada, and performances by Vito Priante, Inga Kalna, and Marijana Mijanovic. Bravo for Vito Priante and his interpretation of GI'otraggi della Sorte, and D'ove la Figlia. He does a great ornamentation in the da capos, and turns up the volume in all the right notes. Just like "Terribile lo Sento", and "Orribile lo Scempio", "GI'otraggi" shares the same musicalization. Somehow, this version of the score is especially more dramatic and  subtlely more melodic. 
My 2 year old son loves this puzzle.  The large pieces are easy to handle, and the colorful pictures keep him entertained.  It keeps him engaged and he's very proud once he's completed it
I do not who to contact on this problem but I have as of yet to recieve a magazine yet. I kow it is to take awhile but i have recieved other order of a  different magazine I placed
After 6 months of unexplained intense fatigue and malaise, numerous doctor visits without results, I obtained Source of Life vitamins upon the recommendation of a friend whose physician had recommended it for them.  With the very first dose, I went from dragging around to walking around--while most vitamins require weeks of use before results are seen. ---  --- At my very next doctor's appointment, I told of my experience with Source of Life and I continue to report it to anyone and everyone that mentions being excessively tired.   Members of my family and several friends now regularly use this outstanding product, and have reported similar results.   Not only did I feel much better with higher energy levels, I also notice fingernail and hair growth as well. ---  --- I use the liquid version and it is actually very tasty.  I highly recommend this product.  I've used it for 3 years and have obtained consistent good results. ---  --- 
Karaoke Revolution Party is a fantastic game with great songs, great easy gameplay and perfect party game features. If you've never tried a karaoke game, now's the time to play. ---  --- First, the basic setup. You get to FULLY customize your character. We're talking black, white, male, female, heavy, skinny, athletic. Then you go for hair styles, hair colors, outfits down to the shoes and jewelry. You can evey use your EyeToy to scan your FACE onto the face of the character. It is simply amazing. ---  --- Then we go onto the song list. I own probably every karaoke game out for the 3 main systems. I love karaoke games. This song list is by far my favorite song list of all time - and it's true for my boyfriend as well. There are a good mix of jumping songs, slow romantic songs, rocking songs and more.  ---  --- In other karaoke games you have to go through unlocking the venues and songs. Because this is a party game, they pretty much give you everything up front, with a few exceptions. You do unlock a few songs and a ton of characters / outfits as you go, to keep things interesting. A few standouts include the Elvis outfit and the cat outfit. ---  --- In addition to being able to sing along in both single player and duet modes, there are a bunch of fun mini-games. You can compete against other players, try to play note-matching games and even set up the eye toy so you see your own background in the game.  ---  --- Even better, if you have a dance pad, you can sing and dance at the same time! This is REALLY great for building up your vocal powers. Many people can sing fine if they stand still like a stick, but when you sing in a band you're actually expected to move around and dance. Using the dance pad helps you build up your lung power and timing so that you get those skills. Even if you're not in a band, you can see the challenges that your favorite singers face. ---  --- This game is a TON of fun both with friends in party mode, or just singing along yourself with the songs. Where some of the previous versions of karaoke sometimes had "questionable" versions of songs, with them being obviously different from the original, these songs are great sounding and many times I didn't have to look at the song bar at all to sing along with them. ---  --- Highly, highly recommended!! ---  --- Rating: 5/5 ---  --- NOTE: The previous reviewer says this has the Aretha Franklin version of Natural Woman. I'm rather sure it's the Carole King version
I have had three of these during my two year contract, I am trying to baby the last one enough until the end of the two years.  Each has had the problem of powering down and re-booting without warning.  The are billed as "Mil-spec" this or that, but unless you keep it inside a purse, get ready for many trips to the Sprint store.  Motorola used to be THE name in communications, but after this and my friend's problems with the Razr's, I'm headed to Nokia
I received this camera as a gift and after 15 magical minutes recording with it, I ran into an error message: "Unit in safeguard mode - remove & reattach battery."  I did what I was told.  Several times.  Same message.  Argh!  (to my husband's chagrin, I read the user's manual completely before using it to avoid such a problem...why is this happening to me?!)  I searched the web looking for a solution, but all I found were perhaps hundreds of people with the SAME message on similar JVC model camcorders, rendering their cameras unuseable with little help from JVC once their warranty ran out.  Luckily I ran into the problem soon enough that we were able to return the product. ---  --- Sure, you might not believe me when I suggest to stay clear of this model.  I'm constantly disregarding Amazon reviews that preach "do not buy this product!", etc.  That's why I'm suggesting that you please take a minute to search the web for this error message before you buy this product and see if you're still convinced you want it.  Suggested search on Google: "jvc camcorder safeguard mode error".
My 2 1/2 year old son cannot have gluten items and these muffins are very adaptable and tasty.  I add fresh apples, bananas, or carrots with crushed pineapple plus some cinnamon or nutmeg and he loves these muffins!  They are a bit plain without the additions, though
I had not realized what great performers Michael Flatley, Colin Dunne and Jean Butler were until I watched this version of Riverdance. The lead dancers in this version are not in the same league and much of the performance is sloppy compared to previous versions. What made Riverdance great for me was the precision, timing, and dancers dancing togeather in the Irish dance numbers. It is all gone here. Try "Riverdance: Live from New York City" or the video tape "Riverdance: The Show" instead. This version should not have been released
Elaine Pagels is a wonderful writer.  Her explanation into early Christianity is wonderful.  It is definitely worth the time to read this.  She delves into the politics of the early church, the Passion, the resurrection, as well as the clashes between Gnostic and Orthodox thinking.  Too often, we forget that what we call the canon is not the only writings available.  She just reminds us that there is this whole other world of writings that did not make it into the bible for one reason or another.  If you want to get an idea of who the Gnostics were, read this
In this first person shooter you battle through the Star Wars battles through all episodes, fighting as soldiers on the Republic's side.  And you have the chance to play as a jedi ehich has more power than a normal soldier.  And, you have the opportunity to do "instant action".  That is where you choose a battlefield and pick a side to fight as.  Also, you can choose to conquer a galaxy, but it's really boring.  This game is really fun, but it starts to get boring after awhile.  So, get some friends to play multiplayer or splitscreen.   --- Also, Yoda is awesome
Excellent product.  The 'over $450 value' might be a bit overstated but the packages is still an excellent value.  During installation, the 1 year free trial to [...] showed up as a 30 day trial but was resolved quickly through familytreemaker.com support and a subsequent call to ancestry.com support.  Ancestry.com provided a 1 year free trial to their US Deluxe product over the phone and didn't ask for a credit card number for renewal.  To me, that's a sign that they're a reputable company.  Some of the additional software in the package is buried on the installation CD but is worth the extra manual effort to find and install - especially the GenSmart software. 
I dont enjoy this publication at all anymore, dont know if editorial leadership has change
Listen up, I'm a big-boned gal who has yo-yoed in weight over the years. Thankfully I'm currently on a downswing, and I hope it stays that way.  Which brings me to Hostess Twinkies which are very overrated.  This is one of my least favorite Hostess snacks, if you want the truth.  The sponge cake is stinky
I bought this item because our son kept on getting his legs and arms stuck.  This item was made for a portable/small crib, not your typical crib.  I had to go out and spend another $40. on velcro so I can make it long/wide enough to fit my son's crib.  It is not worth the aggravation in altering it to fit the crib.  Don't waste your money on something that is not going to work. 
I can't for the life of me understand why Rosetta Stone has garnered such good reviews (although I see a few negative ones here, so I feel validated) and seems to have such an outstanding reputation. I find it practically worthless, and it's expensive to boot. I'm sure that my experience with the German program would apply to Rosetta Stone's other languages as well, as they all taught via the same method.  ---  --- I've been learning German for about 6 months and besides Rosetta Stone I have used Pimsleur, Rocket Languages, and have taken private instruction. Obviously, private instruction is best. But this review is about software, and Pimsleur is best. But Rosetta Stone has more bells & whistles, which is perhaps why people think it is so good. But it isn't. For example, nowhere in Rosetta Stone do you actually learn how to say useful things. Nowhere do you learn how to say "Hello," "How are you, "What's your name," or even "Where's the bathroom." Instead, you will learn how to recognize such useful phrases as "The woman and the boy have a ball on their heads" or "The man is under the donkey" or "These two fish are from the same species" or "The blue triangle is bigger than the red square." Ridiculous!! And note I said "learn how to recognize a phrase." This is the biggest weakness and disappointment with Rosetta Stone. It really doesn't get you to talk at ALL. You are not required to utter a word. You see four pictures, and the speaker will say (in German) "The boy is drinking milk." Now, if you have already heard the word for "boy" (Junge) and three of the pictures have no boys, you simply click on the picture with the boy and presto, you're correct! This multiple choice way of learning is not effective for learning a language! (There is a "practice speaking" mode, equally useless, which I mention below)  ---  --- With Pimsleur, which is an audio only program, you hear conversations that will impart essential words and phrases. And they are repeated (and asks you to repeat) in such a fashion that it sticks. For example, it was weeks ago that it introduced "How much do I owe you?" yet I still remember it. (Wie viel shulde ich Ihnen?--No, I didn't cheat and look it up!) Pimsleur is brilliant in the way it gradually builds your knowledge and abilities. Of course, it isn't perfect as it doesn't explain the grammar. But neither does Rosetta Stone, and Rosetta Stone is worse because with Pimsleur there is also an English speaker who explains some things, while with Rosetta Stone you are left to twist in the wind. That's why software language learning programs should be seen as supplements--supplements to classroom or private instruction.  ---  --- What are the bells & whistles on Rosetta Stone? You get to do a lesson in a variety of ways--seeing pictures with audio (the speaker), or pictures with audio and text, or audio only, for example. There is also a feature where the speaker on the program says a phrase, and you repeat it into a microphone and can compare your voice signature to the speaker's. But I found that this didn't work well at all and wasn't worth the trouble. And again, the phrases weren't useful
As you can see by other posts - we were all duped by a misleading advertisement.  It still shows "realistic tail movement" in the listing.  HELLO!!!  WHAT TAIL?!?!?!?!?  They have since changed the picture to the doll we all received.  The original picture showed the swimming one (tail attached).  My daughter was absolutely heartbroken when she opened this and realized this doll has no tail, nor does she swim.  I fully expect to be allowed to return this thing (opened) at no cost to myself. 
I picked up this book expecting a fresh approach and analysis of Dr. King apart from the obligatory images we're force-fed each new year.  Instead, I was disappointed to find that Eric Dyson made heavy use of speculation with the intent to scandalize more than to inform and enlighten.  One such example includes Dyson conveying the idea that Dr. King may have engaged in orgies with many different women along with his right-hand man Ralph Abernathy.  He then goes on to infer that there was talk of King and Abernathy engaging in sexual acts with each other!  The author had no commentary to either support or dispel this "theory" making Dyson's retelling of the alleged incident totally irresponsible and even libelous.  He just dropped the information, true or untrue, in the readers lap to do with as the reader pleased.  To that end, it is my opinion that Dyson's intent in writing this book was in no way honorable or truth-seeking, rather it was a means to convey his baseless ideas to anyone who would listen.  I'm reminded of something my grandmother and mother would always say to me, "an empty wagon makes the loudest noise." Eric Dyson makes a lot of noise in this book but totally lacks substance.  This was an expensive tabloid
This is a cute idea but the suction cups are misshapen and don't stick to my son's highchair at all. Very disappointing
This is a surprisingly poor movie. Although it has some well-known actors, and a notable director, the material was just presented badly and predictably - like a lousy late night TV-movie with profanity inserted to liven it up. ---  --- The movie makes a simplified joke of the legal system and its sterotypical failings (though legitimate in many cases). It also glosses over the grieving process of the family, ignores the normal safety warnings to the remaining child, overdoes Kiefer Sutherland's character flaws (which are considerable nevertheless), and generally oversimplifies everything into a neat package to which you already know the ending because of the spoiler title. ---  --- In one particularly-bad scene, after taking martial arts classes and other measures to prepare herself mentally and physically, Sally's character simply stares open-mouthed and dumbfounded at Keifer's character when they meet on the street and he talks to her. ---  --- I don't know what I missed that the 4- and 5-star reviewers like so much. I only see wide-spread mediocrity. ---  --- I would only recommend this for fans of Keifer. "Ssssssorry", Sally, not your best role or movie. Ditto Ed Harris, whose other movies I generally like. --- 
Half-Life made its debut in 1998, and it shocked the entire world. Half-Life at the time featured stunning graphics, gameplay, and sound. It was simply one of those games that had to be in every gamers hands, and still to this date Half-Life is a game that every action-game developing company carefully needs to study in order for their games to be a success. Shortly after the release and once the gasp from the world has ended, two game developers joined together to create a game that not gasped the world again, but made it scream. ---  --- The game pits terrorists and counter-terrorists in a fast-paced sort of "S.W.A.T." type of tactical firefighting gameplay. Matches can consist of one of two types of game types. The first and probably the most popular type is bomb defusal. In both of the game types, you can win by either eliminating the opposing team or following the objective. In bomb defusal a random player on the team will receive the bomb each round. The player can plant the bomb in one of two bomb spots or simply drop the bomb for another teammate to pick it up and use it. Once the bomb is planted the counter-terrorists must defuse it regardless if the terrorists have been eliminated. The counter-terrorists usually have about thirty-five seconds to defuse the bomb and win the round. The second type of gameplay is hostage rescue. The terrorists must protect four hostages in an area of the map from the counter-terrorists rescuing them and taking them to their base. If the hostages are killed by the terrorists or counter-terrorists, nothing will happen except that now the counter-terrorists must completely kill the terrorists to gain victory in the round. At the start of each round all players have a few seconds to quickly buy weapons with the money they have achieved from past rounds by victories. Both teams have a significant difference in the arsenal of weapons you can choose from, but neither really focuses on a specific time of gun style. All of the weapons in the game are one-hundred percent realistic and deadly as in reality. This is an element that makes Counter-Strike such a superior game.  ---  --- Counter-Strike is without argument the most popular online action game in the world. An entire culture has formed around it. So what makes it such an extremely addictive and popular game? It is purely because of the fantastically well-crafted gameplay and not the graphics, or the game would not be as popular as it is. Players around the world will give you many "deep" reasons why it is such a great game. But one without argument stands out. It is simply the fact that versus other games, it is "difficult" to make a kill in the game. What makes the game so addicting is the pleasure of killing someone after a long thirty second gunfight or a quick shot to the head, knowing that the dead player is now experiencing some form of anger as he waits out the rest of the round. Another element is how realistic the guns feel in the game. Regardless if they are fake and the shooting has been totally simulated, it has been superiorly well done. And definitely once a new player to the game has gained enough experience to achieve kills at least periodically, a feeling of "power" will be experienced when holding an AK-47 or an M4. The game is quite punishing to new players, and a total hapzard to players who have never played first-person shooters or video games at all. But regardless the stress you feel at first, there is absolutely no reason to put down the game because of the entry-difficulty, as it is almost guaranteed you will get better in the game. ---  --- There are over ten maps in the game, and each one has been done as a masterpiece. All of the maps wildly differ from each other in the feel of action and even the environment. The most popular of all the maps, de_dust2 that has been created by DaveJ, is still commonly referenced in many gaming parodies, magazines, shows, etc. Due to its style and simplicity, it is a godly-designed map and arguably the most popular map in first-person shooter history. One thing that helps to fight a player of being bored of the game is simply the maps. Since each map has been superbly designed, a player could easily switch to another one after being bored and continue on with play, and with a different feel. The game also has many public map editors which 3rd parties can use to create custom maps. fy_iceworld and awp_map are some very popular maps that have been created by amateur designers. This makes Counter-Strike a game with an almost "infinite" value sort of feel.  ---  --- The sound in Counter-Strike is absolutely insanely-realistic. The first time a player plays or even watches another player play the game, the person will definitely without a doubt notice the clear sounds of AK-47 fire or pistol fire. Not much is known why the guns sound so realistic, and the player's best guess is that the designers have actually recorded live gunfire of the weapons. The sound of the weapons combined with the look and feel; end up making the player totally immersed into the game and with a feeling of "power". This sort of thing is extremely rare in video game.  ---  --- At the time Counter-Strike had simply jaw-dropping graphics. Created all from the Half-Life engine, players were amazed at the lighting effects and how clear the textures were. At the present, the game doesn't hold the same, but it is what in the past has mattered. Half-Life was one of the first games in history to have some slightly complex and dynamic physics. The bouncing of a flashbang or a player being blown away was also something at the time to look at. Games before the release of Half-Life hardly had any sort of physics, and if they did, it would be something very basic.  ---  --- Counter-Strike is a game that without argument should be on any player's hard drive. There are still even thousands of players that since from the release of the game back at 1998, still actually play the game without losing an ounce of boredom. Counter-Strike will forever be played, and is the heart of all action games from the past, present, and the future.
When I first looked at this game in the store I wasn't real sure about it.  I was totally surprised when I got it home and tried it out.  It starts out slow but that is only to prepare you for what is to come!  It has the greatest storyline and add great graphics, wonderful characters and easy to learn controls.  Put all that together and you have OKAMI!!  I am an avid gamer I love all types but mainly enjoy action/adventure.  I am a 36 year old mother of 4 and I so enjoy sitting down with my kids and kicking their butt (in a game of coarse)we all have so much fun together.  I know that alot of people look down at video games in general but I DO SPEND QUALITY TIME with my kids!  Anyway, this game was an absolute masterpiece!  It had it all!  I have played god Of War, Samari Warriors 1,2 & EX. Legends, Dynasty Warriors, Norrath, Balders Gate just to name a few.  This game was the icing on the cake!  I have never written reviews about any games before but I just couldn't keep from saying something about this game!!  I plan to play it over and over because I know there is plenty more to do in this game that I may have missed the first time.  This game has to be a qualifier for, if not the winner for GAME OF THE YEAR!!!! --- Respectfully, ---         Pretty Mam
These are great for removing excess oil when you can't stop and wash your face or don't want to disturb your makeup.  I prefer this brand because they unfold to twice their size when you pull them out instead of the size of a half-dollar like the rest of them
I just renewed my subscription to Glamour because they are one of the only magazines I have ever read that feature both a significant amount of affordable items (i.e. less than $100) as well as intelligent, relevant articles about women AND men.   ---  --- Sure, they have their "off" months, but I really appreciate that ads don't tend to dominate the magazine as much as others (especially for as low as the subscription rate is).  I also can't wait to see the "Do's and Don'ts" every month
Still think that Marie Claire is a cut above most women's magazines
I am seeing results after three weeks.  I LOVE this stuff
Sensational is a word I'd use to describe Singer Jesse McCartney. Good looks and powerful vocals. He's talented and sweet. If you haven't gotten a copy of his latest CD 'Right Where You Want Me', buy it today
Obviously, it's cheap. But I've had mine over a year now.... no it hasn't failed, but it does scare me.  besides the plastic cracking, the fan is making me nervous.  About half the time now when I turn it on the fan make this really loud buzzing noise, which changes frequency over time, slowing down.  I have a bad feeling that the fan is not held in alignment well, and that the loud noise is the fan blades scraping against their surroundings (because it vibrates quite a bit).  This vibration can only mean bad things for the drive inside, and I'm not looking forward to the day when my cheapo choice of enclosure causes my HD to crash and lose all my photos, music, backups, etc. ---  --- Currently shopping for a replacement, and I would not recommend this
This is probably one of the most outstanding and rewarding software programs that I can ever remember purchasing. I never learned how to type, so I reserved myself from many computer projects/reports, email responses and business related aspects due to this 'achilles heel'. ---  --- Well, I researched this software and found that it has come a long way from earlier versions and decided it's time to give it a try. I even bought a Plantronics CS55 - USB wireless headset from the get go to give this software a real workout. Let me tell you, my pessimism was definitely challenged because the software worked extremely good about 20 minutes after opening the box and browsing the tutorial. I was talking sentences and watched it appear on my monitor within seconds. I speeded up my speach as if talking in a normal conversation with someone and this software just kept spitting it on-screen. AMAZING!!!! Don't get me wrong. There are occasional misspellings to deal with but your user profile keeps getting updated everytime you use it and prevents the same mistakes from occuring the next time. It begins to gain more and more accuracy. ---  --- Salvation has been found as far as I'm concerned. ---  --- P.S. I began running the program with WIN XP - 512MB Ram and it performed very well. I just upped to 2 gigs ram. Most everyone in forums recommends at least 1 gig Ram. ---  --- I did this review in about 1 min. and had only two misspells.
Pops great in the microwave.  Much better than many store brands.  Good product
Our 3 year old son just loves Hot Wheels cars.  This transporter, however, is not one of his favorites.  It's easy to see why.  The back is difficult to lower, with it being controlled by a very small button on the bottom of the trailer.  Who ever thought of this design for a child?  It's also very easy for the child to accidentally get his fingers caught in the trailer when lowering it.   ---  --- The cones and barrels are easily lost and the storage of them in the trailer is badly designed.  They have a small piece of plastic that "locks" in the barrels or cones which is impossible for a child to figure out.   ---  --- I'd recommend passing on this toy if you have a child in the 3-5 year old range.  
TALK ABOUT A WASTE OF MONEY.  FIRST OF ALL WHAT IS TYCO THINKING.  $70 FOR THE TOY AND YOU HAVE TO BUY THE BATTERY PACK SEPARATELY?!?!?! ---  --- NOT TO MENTION I COULD NOT FIND THE BATTERY PACK ANYWHERE.  ALL THE STORES WERE SOLD OUT. ALL WEB SITES (TOYS R US, KAYBEE TOYS, ETC) WERE SOLD OUT.  ALL OTHER SITES (SPECIALTY HOBBY SHOPS) HAD THEM AT RIDICULUOUS PRICES, WHICH DID NOT INCLUDE SHIPPING. ---  --- I FINALLY FOUND IT AT AMAZON.COM AT A REASONABLE PRICE AND I OPTED FOR THEIR FREE SHIPPING WHICH TOOK LONGER THAN I WOULD HAVE LIKED BUT AT LEAST THEY HAVE THAT MONEY SAVING OPTION WHICH HELPS. ---  --- MY SON PLAYED WITH IT ONCE AND HATED IT.  IT WAS HIS # 1 CHOICE ON HIS X-MAS LIST.  TALK ABOUT A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT FOR US BOTH
I do video work and was attracted to the sale price and extra height of this particular tripod.  Come to find out, this model does not have a fluid head, meaning, if you do any panning with a camcorder, it won't be as smooth as you'd probably like it to be.  Also, at the end of a pan the head tends to "unwind," causing your panned image to back up a little ways.  Thus, I think it's rather misleading to label this as a "Photo / Video" tripod.   ---  --- Additionally, I don't really care for the cheap feel of some of the plastic knobs and adjusters.  Finally, mine came with a few, very minor cosmetic blemishes, almost as if it were used. ---  --- Instead of video, I'll be utilizing this one as a microphone mount. ---  --- If you want to do video, please buy a tripod with a fluid head.  You'll love it, I guarantee that. ---  --- That's why I give this one 2 stars
I paid $35 for a barely adequate product case. It does not securely mount or protect the Creative Zen. It is overpriced and underperforms. As others have mentioned, you must cut it out of the protective covering only to discover that the internal configuration of the case does not protect the screen nor clamp or positively hold the player. The set up feature is a joke -- you have to configure the assembly with an elastic band. taking it out of case voids the ability to return the product. The Design engineer should be fired. ---  --- DO NOT BUY -- THIS IS JUN
We bought this for our kids for Christmas. Of course we open the box on Christmas Eve at 10PM to put it together and there are no instructions! It looks easy but without instructions we are not sure about the pins etc. Could someone post the phone number of the company so we can call them. Tomorrow morning should be interesting!  --- Merry Christmas...
for $10 these were too good to pass up.  First noticed that the gold balls are glued or welded into the stem.. the earring is not all one piece.  First time I wore them, lost one because the back slipped off though they weren't tugged or snagged to cause the earring to pop out.    ---  --- This is the second pair I bought... first set was fine.  Seems like the quality of construction may be slipping   (or a different supplier?) --- 
I rarely get taken, but I did this time.  One song played 50 times.  No instructions.  Pad not in tune with TV movements.  This is going to a garage sale or charity
Simply put, Jay-Z is incredibly overrated.  I own a couple of his CDs but to be honest, I never really liked him.  His beats never grabbed me and his lyrics never stunned me so much that I just had to go back and listen to a specific song again.  He mostly raps about drugs, money and cars.  Nothing special, nothing new. I'm just being real about it, since everyone else is on his d!ck.  I think the reason he's so respected is because he blew up right after Biggie died and he was the closest thing to him at the time.   ---  --- Granted, Jay-Z does use some good metaphors, but for the most part his lyrics are shallow.  ---  --- Best tracks on this album: ---  --- Can't Knock the Hustle --- Brooklyn's Finest w/Biggie --- Dead President
I love these shoes! They are so comfy and cute and Keds is my favorite brand of shoes
Received my moive as quickly as promised and have had no problems
I bought these pods on Amazon because they were a dollar cheaper than at the local grocery store.  Now I know why.  When I opened the package the Senseo Watermark was faint or hardly visable and it took me 3x the amount of pods to make a decent cup of coffee.  Buyer beware,  I am back to buying pods at the grocery store. 
I've had my Cobra 29 for over five years now. It's been in four different trucks, and traveled over 500,000 miles with me. Once I added two wilson antennas and a power mic, I can get out over four miles on a good night. My personal record is a line of sight 130 miles from a mountainside. I love it. I was thinking of getting a galaxy, but why? I have a great radio here
I just bought and installed this CD with the hopes of learning some Haitian Creole, and I, too, couldn't find it.  There is absolutely nothing on the installation CD that mentions either Haiti or creole... except the jewel case which insists it's there.  I'm so dissapointed I haven't actually tested anything else out:  I consider this a VERY bad start
Great value, looks and performes great!!!!!!   Has a lot of class, and goes great with any type of apparel. Only down fall, occurs when placing the alarm, it's kind off complex.
Iam very pleased with this item, I purchased it for my son
I'd don't know exactly how to write an in-depth review of anything, let alone a candybar, so I'll just describe what I think of it. ---  --- In my opinion, the Dark Chocolate Toblerone candy bar is my favore candy bar for simple reasons: ---  --- 1. Dark chocolate is my favorite kind of chocolate --- 2. The honey that's added adds a subtle smoothness --- 3. The almond pieces aren't very big so the bar is mostly chocolate --- 4. Swiss chocolate is the best chocolate I've eveer had --- 5. There's no denying the packaging is really neat ---  --- What can I say, it's a candy bar
This thing was a nightmare for us. So much in fact that we returned it. It never played the movies correctly and even scratched every movie we played in it. Do not waste your money on this thing
These are the best banana chips I've ever had and the dried cherries are a great combination!  I would highly recommend this product
Quite disappointing if you are expecting a film true to the book. Hopefully they will remake the movie soon, because the technical capabilities back in 1966 did not do the novel any justice
I'm a PC mechanic. I have been using Ad-Aware with Ad-Watch (now called Ad-Aware Plus) for the last 5 years.  It's pretty good at what it does, but there is newer technology that is going to replace it soon. --- I've never had any problems with these program - it does NOT add any malware - it REMOVES it. --- However, using Ad-Aware and Ad-Watch to their fullest does take some computer savvy - as it seems does any anti-malware on the market these days. --- ALL of the other runtime problems the other reviewers here have reported are "fixable" by using the controls and tweaks in the software, so that you are not overprotecting your system - one example, the pop-up blocker in Ad-Watch is adjustable as to its intensity.  However, this requires changing TWO settings - one in Ad-Watch itself and one in Ad-Aware. ---    --- And, yes, at times, I have had to turn Ad-Watch off to download a file or see a popup I wanted.  Soooo?  Software these days is not as "automatic" as the companies would have you believe.   ---  --- If you're not willing to take the time to learn (which also means going to the company's online user forums and asking questions), just stick with what Windows offers, don't use Outlook or Outlook Express (major source of malware on PCs) and only look at websites you know are safe.  (Kinda like the safest form of sex is abstinence - the safest form of surfing is NONE!!!
His first novel, THE KNOWN WORLD, won the Pulitzer Prize. This is the book he wrote first, a short story collection that I've been looking forward to reading for a long time. It was a National Writing Award finalist and a Hemingway PEN winner.  ---  --- With a pedigree like that, do I really need to review it? Sure, why not?  ---  --- When I reviewed his novel, did I mention that he has an amazing ear for dialogue? He does. I believe it shines brighter in this setting than in such a sweeping and breathtaking saga as his novel.  ---  --- These are stories that you will feel in your heart, your mind, your soul, your gut. You'll pause between each story so you can ride the wave of awe before you eagerly read the next. Jones is an amazing author. He's why we read, and he's why some of us try to write. Very few will ever reach this man's level, but the attempt is always good for us. 
i think j-14 is a really good magazine if u like to hear the latest gossip about all your favourite celebrity's, or if u like to get nice posters of all the hot celebrity's, or even if u like to take those quizes to find out lots of neat different things!! i recomend this magazine to anyone who likes either of those things
I found this toy to be a waste of money.  It was hard for my five year old to close or put more than two things in it.  It says it holds three barbie's and cloths but then how do you close it
Oh those were the days, when I was in college, reading my first issues and then subscribing.  There were great things to be found in its pages, columns by Brian Crozier, Russell Kirk, Erik von Kuenhelt-Leddhin (sp?).  The great struggle with the Soviet Union was going into a critical stage.  It seemed NR was so on the right track.  And it was wonderful to read, at least from about 1979 to 1983. ---  --- But then it became for a while duller.  It had some periods of recrudescence, such as under the editorship of John O'Sullivan.  But when Rich Lowry took over NR really began to dumb down (nothing personal Mr. Lowry). ---  --- But what I've really discovered of late is how badly the neo-con agenda has sort have taken over the magazine.  We've got in the 50th Anniversary issue a call by Midge Dector to rally the country to our illegal and immoral war in Iraq.  Really something has happened to the magazine, a sinister force has entrenched itself there.  What is that force?  Well, go to come-and-hear.com and you will begin to learn part of the picture, especially when you read the material by Elizabeth Dilling.  I would also recommend Paul Findley's THEY DARE TO SPEAK OUT, which details the Israeli Lobby's domination of our Congress.   ---  --- NR was once a courageous conservative magazine, but now it has been heavily tainted by the influence of a terrible thing. WFB should know better, and maybe he does.  If he doesn't, then he should pick up NEO-CONNED! and NEO-CONNED AGAIN!, and then he should listen to Tony Martin's talk given to the IHR on a certain group's tactics deployed to suppress free speech.   ---  --- What has inspired me to write this review is WFB's recent column on the incarceration of David Irving.  It ends in a disgusting gloating.  WFB has fallen into an evil trap, and so has the magazine he used to run.  What has happened to the Christian faith of people like Buckley?  He now seems lost and terribly afraid of offending that supposedly saintly interest group...And you, Mr. Lowry, come on now: read widely and deeply and don't be afraid of reading the Talmud and about the Israeli lobby.  Once you do, maybe you'll develop the strength to think outside the box.  We're going to have to do that if we want anything but the bleakest future for mankind and the planet. ---  --- 
This is the best snack bar we have tried. It has the highest quality raw organic ingredients and they are blended into a delicious bar. --- We have tried a few of their flavors and this and Rasberry Chocolate are our favorites
I first heard Joe playing in that urgent style of his, on Horace Silvers' "song for my father" album. The thing about him is that his playing has always sounded mature and developed, like he was born to play.  On this CD, Felicidade in particuliar, he simmers, builds to a rolling  boil, and simmers again so nicely as he takes you to Brasil. Also the  straight ahead playing on Triste' is nothing short of marvelous playing by  the group!  The whole is CD is great. Go 'head Joe
Purchased as a gift to client. The gift basket arrived on time and the recipient commented on how nice the basket was. But one of the cups was chipped. They could not find the chipped piece so we don't know whether or not the break occurred during shipping or not. Either way better care could have been used to insure that the cups are in perfect condition upon arrival. I'm very disappointed especially since this was sent as a gift to an important client. Starbucks coffee and mugs are great corporate gifts but I would choose another company to handle the gift baskets. Will not use them again
It is unfortunate that the only video presentation of Amahl is so generously flawed in stagecraft and sound production. It is not necessary to enumerate specifics here since some were cited in Ms. Lynch's review. True, Ms. Stratas' voice was often subjugated by the orchestra, but there were also  moments when her diction was less than perfect, during times which the orchestra had, gratefully, been relegated to a less prominent decibel level.  Here, sound production staff  must share blame.  Menotti knew what he was writing. A brilliant orchestrator, he etched clearly, the differences between orchestral dialogue and accompaniment figures. Staging, at times, appears to have little to do with the music. When one thinks of Menotti and opera (almost synonymous), the marriage of music AND theatre is considered a perfect union. Sadly, Menotti's obvious musical intentions were overlooked. It is heartening to read that a new video of this opera may be produced. I would disagree with Ms. Lynch that it is a good introduction to this operatic work. The beginning, the introduction makes the strongest impression.  It is lasting.  This is one indelibility I would not welcome
Whether you're Greek - or whatever - just about anyone can relate to Toula's life. After having deemed herself hopeless for thirty-odd years, then finally meeting the man of her dreams, Toula's real obstacle is surving her family! While his parents are quiet and typical Americans, Toula's clan embraces their roots -- telling strangers the intimate details of their medical histories, roasting a lamb in the front yard, Gramma in the old-country babushka. You'll laugh til you cry, 'cause chances are, you know someone exactly like each of Toula's relatives..
After I ordered this product, one of my co-workers told me about the reviews on Amazon.  I checked it out and I was really surprised!  The reviews are poor.  The worst part, though, is that the product is listed three times!!  What's the deal??  A product gets a bad review, so they re-list it... more bad reviews and they re-list it AGAIN!  See for yourself, do a general search for "Hylexin" and you will see several listings of the SAME product.  Trying to out run bad reviews????  I now think less of the product AND Amazon.  Shame on you both
Good tips to read about when you do not have time to get out on the course
These speakers are big in size but short on performance.  Except for the price tag, not much else excites one about them.  They make a good surround sound system with the Sony 3 speaker set for surround sound, but for listening to music you are better off with a set of good bookshelf speakers with a decent sub.  These speakers lack bass inspite of their size, and sound quality is poor at higher volumes
Looks great, but NOT worth the money.   My son begged for this toy - and it was a big dud.  Almost impossible to fly - I think once out of 50 tries were we successful.   Made out of flimsy material, it chipped and scraped right away.   ---  --- Do NOT buy this toy!!!!!
A shallow treatment of shallow characters with shallow values... A waste of time.
I ordered this hoping that it would fit my camera and accessories and it did. I have a Stylus 750 plus a pop up screen shade, an extra battery, and an extra picture card. There are two slots specifically designed to fit two picture cards on the inside cover. In the main compartment, a small slit will fit an extra battery or two plus a creit card and perhaps a bit of paper money. (It won't fit much more than that, though.) It's compact, stylish and functional--I'm glad I bought it
I received the MV50 for Christams to air up my RAM 1500 Megacab after surf fishing. I gave it a trial run in my driveway today and was very happy. I dropped my front tire down to 15 PSI. The MV50 aired up to 45 PSI in 2 minutes !!! Very cool. With the length of hose and jumper cable attachments I can reach the back right tire as well. You can't beat it for the money
At first I was bugged by how sticky this was, but boy did it work! They gave me 1/2 ounce tube in the hospital (and charged me $9 for it, but that's another story!) It moisturizes and protects your nipples from chafing while nursing, and doesn't bother baby a bit. Take my advice, bring your own tube to the hospital to avoid being over-charged!
Fellini brings light on space instead of space on light.  --- He brings mysticism to the movie not the movie to mysticism. ---  --- He brings boredom and rattling to a new height.  --- Lots of nice emotionalism and sweat.  --- Waging tongues and blood. Candles and tits.  --- Bondage and perversion.  ---  --- We learn Italian words that we can not use. ---  --- Here is a good tidbit "Child of Aphrodite and Hermes...Hermaphrodite." ---  --- The subtitles conveniently disappear at crucial moments. Even in Italian the voices do not match the sound.  ---  --- One of the roman dudes Encolpio (Martin Potter) finally got a real part as "Doctor Who" in1983.
This router functions great in the household environment.  It is VERY easy to install and security is equally as easy to set.
I have just got this bed set 5 days ago and love it! It could be used for a girl or boy. I have looked around for bedding for a portable crib and could not find anything I liked and they seemed high in price, well then I found this one and it's fits perfect on a portable crib. And it's alot cuter than the picture! I really do like it. The only thing is I wish it had a dust ruffel :
A great resource for first time and experienced importers who do not fully understand their responsibilites as an importer. 
The product (5 brushes) was delivered in a timely fashion and it is a great product.  Heavy duty, which I need
I recently started Weight Watchers and was looking to purchase a new and accurate scale.  I figured I would buy a WW product, but after reading the reviews, I decided to go with the Omron scale.  I am very pleased with this product.  It has been extremely accurate.  It keeps a history for both my husband and I.  I would highly recommend this scale to anyone!  It is also an attractive scale which is a bonus.  Go with the Omron scale
The best buy in the marketplace.  It easily fits into my suitcase for travel...the level works nicely and very sturdy for as light as it is
The toy is a good idea, but it needs to be more user friendly, instructions are hard to follow, even for adults,maybe not quite so much activities at one time, could simplify some for younger players
Hello world,Wowee zowee, very "wacky" little gem. Remember seeing the cover when my Dad took me into the video store, I was around 6 or 7 and it stuck in my mind. When I was about 21 or 22 one of my friends flat buddies had it on Beta tape, so I borrowed it cause I still have a Beta(really shouldn't have mentioned that). A true slasher basher not for the timid, truly written and directed by booby hatch patients, and were they found the actors is beyond me! Filmed in georgeous New Jersey of course not far from the original Friday the 13th. Its a real winner!!! Creepiest Mom ever. Love her old dodge or plymouth?
I don't want to hear any more of their music on the radio. It is all just nonsense, and none of it should have ever been made. They are one of the worst hip hop acts in recent memory
I HAVE TO WRITE IN CAPS BECAUSE I AM SO IRRITATED.  I HAVE TRIED 5 DIFFERENT CAROL'S HAIR PRODUCTS AND NONE INCLUDING THIS ONE HAS WORKED.  NOT ONLY THAT THE SMELLS AREN'T ALL THAT GREAT AND THEY SCREAM.  IT'S LIKE PEOPLE WHO WEAR BAD PERFUME THAT'S EXTREMELY STRONG, BUT SMELLS HORRIBLE, THEY THINK IT SMELLS GOOD BUT IT DISGUST EVERYON
I loved "Come Away With Me" the first moment I heard it.  I also had the opportunity to see Norah and her wonderful band in concert ... the experience was absolutely FANTASTIC! I couldn't have asked for a better! --- So naturally I waited in eager anticipation for her new album "Feels Like Home" which after only one listen made me feel narcoleptic.  It was a good thing I didn't try and listen to it while driving.  To be perfectly honest, I haven't listened to it since. --- She is so talented, I wish this effort had been as successful as the first, but not everyone hits a homerun each time at bat. --- But I still hold out hope that her next album will be better
...I'm so dissappointed in CaseLogic for discontinuing the hard cases. They were great, a HARD cover with rubberized coating and actual cd case style holders inside (that you pop out with your finger by pressing the center). Somebody could have sat on it and it would've been fine..
IF you have any interest in design, i recommend getting this mag, it has the latest trends in design as well as new products and designers
Nintendo DS Lite (2006.)  ---  --- INTRODUCTION:  --- In late 2004, Nintendo premiered the Nintendo Dual Screen, or Nintendo DS for short. Despite the skepticism from many critics and fans alike, the new console quickly won audiences over. It was Nintendo's best handheld console to date. And in 2006, Nintendo released a smaller, lighter version of the system, appropriately called the DS Lite.  ---  --- OVERVIEW:  --- Nintendo released the DS Lite in mid 2006. The new version of the system is smaller than the old version, features repositioned buttons/switches/etc, variable brightness levels, and a few other changes from the classic DS. It retails for about $130.00 and comes in three colors - White, Black, and Pink.  ---  --- REVIEW:  --- Nintendo did a good job revising the DS. Many problems with the older version of the system are fixed. Here are some of the highlights and flaws of the new version.  ---  --- -THE GOOD-  --- -SMALLER AND MORE COMPACT THAN THE ORIGINAL DS. The original DS was rather bulky in comparison to some other handhelds on the market, and it was kind of a pain to haul around. Finally, we've got a smaller, lighter version of the system that can easily be transported.  --- -VARIABLE BRIGHTNESS LEVELS. You can adjust the brightness to your liking with this version of the DS. Brighter levels use more battery power, lower levels use less, so you can plan out how best to use your battery's life.  --- -FEATURES A CLIP IN THE GAME BOY ADVANCE SLOT. Unlike the original DS, the Lite version includes a clip that goes in the slot where Game Boy Advance games fit. This helps to give the system a streamlined appearance, and it keeps that slot cleaner.  --- -COMPATIBLE WITH THE E-READER. The old DS, due to its shape, couldn't use the E-Reader accessory. The Lite model's shape is better all around, and it can use it!  --- -AVAILABLE IN THREE COOL COLORS. Whether you want white, black, or pink, there's a color for everyone.  --- -REPOSITIONED BUTTONS AND THINGS. Nintendo made the system more convenient to use by moving the buttons around to spots that are easier to use.  --- -REDESIGNED STYLUS. The new stylus is bigger and thicker than the ones with the old DS, and is an all-around improvement.  --- -COMPATIBLE WITH THE OLDER DS. Since it's basically the same system, you won't have any compatibility issues.  ---  --- -THE BAD-  --- -SMALLER ISN'T NECESSARILY BETTER IN EVERY WAY. I have big hands and they fit the old DS fine. Shrinking it actually makes it a little harder, in some aspects, to use all of the buttons.  --- -STILL NOT COMPATIBLE WITH PRE-GAME BOY ADVANCE GAMES. Of course I wasn't really expecting Nintendo to fix this.  --- -STILL NOT COMPATIBLE WITH GAME BOY ADVANCE MULTIPLAYER. Another thing I wasn't expecting fixed.  ---  --- OVERALL:  --- Overall this is a nice improvement over the original DS. There are problems, but for the most part, just the same problems the original had. If you haven't gotten a DS yet, definitely go for the Lite model.  ---  --- EDITION NOTES:  --- The DS Lite is relatively new and should be in stores for years to come.
Upon the joyful news that we were having a girl, my husband decided to invest in a new digital camera and a photo printer. The digital camera still works great--the printer is another matter. While this one prints beautiful pictures, the cost of ink far outweighs the beauty of them sometimes. ---  --- As we all know, this is how printer companies make their money, through the ink. Replacing every cartridge at once will run you about $75 at a time, give or take a few. The gray ink is used up the quickest, and has also been one of the hardest for us to find here locally. The main problem I have with this printer is that the quality is excellent after you replace the ink, but for only about the first 50-70 pictures. After that. The pictures take on too much of a magenta cast and start to get out of register--very frustrating when you're printing out any pictures, let alone ones of your child. Yes, we do what the manual sugests for such occasions, and the main one is to clean the printer cartridge heads, but this has only actually worked for us on one occassion. Every other time get us no results and we are still stuck with pictures that resemble something a third grader took a crayon to. In the long run, I will not be buying a photo printer for home use, but will rather take them to a store for processing.  ---  --- Quality-wise, it gets you in the beginning, but doesn't hold out for the long run. We have fiddled with it for two years. Enough's enough
I fell for the hype and now am out quite a bit of money....... Save your money, trust me! I used this product 2-3 times a day until the entire tube was gone (took several months) and saw NO change whatsoever! I have serious dark circles, which is what it claims to help. I am VERY disappointed with this company and their product and will never buy any item with their name on it again! What a bunch of crap......   BTW - look at *all* the reviews, this product is listed in several places here !!
The product was easy to use and accurate.  It is also a great buy
Very easy to remove old igniter and install this one on my Weber Spirit 500 grill.  Took about 5 minutes and started up on the first push of the button.  No more trying to light a match and stick it through the hole on a windy/cold day
What a crock as it looks like everyone else got good product and good service!  I got a shuffle and something happened the second time I tried to load music to make it not even play.  I took it to the Apple Store in Mall of America (Minneapolis, MN) and they claimed to know there was an issue and claimed to have fixxed it.  I go back home (OK) and it still does not work.  Apple said for $113 they'll fix.  Gee thanks!  I'll be looking at another brand!  Apple stinks
We never receive the zoo books, so I am not sure how they are illustrated. My son is  very disappointed. I hope no one else orders from Zoo books, and if you have I hope you have not had the same problems as us. I have never had any problems with any of the merchants from Amazon.com. Hopefully since I never receive the Magazine as promise after emails and phone calls to them, they can at least reimburse us for the purchase amount
I bought this from another retailer on "black Friday" for half of what Amazon is selling it for and I'm still bringing it back.  I think it's horrible.  I was so excited to get a mini-dv camcorder because I heard how great the picture was, but this takes horrible video. It comes out so dark that you can hardly see anything, even using the light.  Even in a fairly well-lit room it came out dark.  It looked Ok on the lcd screen, but when I hooked it up to the TV, horrible!  And it's not my TV either because I hooked up my old camcorder and it looked fine.  I love that it's so small, but if I can't see the video, it's no use to me.  Back to by big old Sony
Holds the phone in an attractive, snug, leather case!  Clips to belt and holds tight.  Since the phone is horizontal and not vertical, I don't have trouble catching it on things.  I've broken the clip on several cases getting in and out of the car.  The phone would catch on something and the plastic clip would snap.  This case works great and eliminates that problem!  The perfect solution
I purchased these for my fiance to wear for our beach wedding in Puerto Rico.  The quality is horrendous, the cut is for MC Hammer not real men, and the company charged me over $22.00 to ship them to me and then told me I wanted them Fed EX.  Not true, the pants were returned, the rest of my order cancelled and I will never purchase anything from this company again
I bought the SR-60 after a lenghty review on the internet. My goal was to find the best available headphones for a low budget (around $80). I have been very satisfied with the SR-60. The sound is great, confort is incredible. Since sound is not contained they may be somewhat annoying for surrounding non-listeners. So if you are looking for first quality sound, low budget headphones and don't care to much about the looks, these are the ones to go with. 
 I just bought a Xbox 360 Pro System a couple of weeks ago from my local Gamespot Store along with Call of Duty 3.  I later on got Gears of War from Circuit City. ---  ---  The Xbox 360 Pro System is by far the best console system out there no matter what anybody says for the money. Yes the Sony PlayStation 3 has the Blu-Ray disc media format and the Nintendo Wii system has the new remote controller for 3-D movement. But both the PlayStation 3 and the Nintendo Wii console systems just came out and both systems already have major bugs in them.  There are already alot of people out there who regret buying one of those systems. ---  ---  If your smart, you'll wait a year until all the bugs are fix in both those console systems and then think about purchasing one of those systems.  That is what I did with the Xbox 360.  Yes there were major problems with the Xbox 360 when it first came out just like there are major problems now with the PlayStation 3 and the Nintendo Wii console systems.  I waited a year until Microsoft fixed all the bugs in the Xbox 360 and then I went out and purchased it. ---  ---  Right now the Xbox 360 has the best selection of games out there. The Xbox Live Marketplace is the best online service out there.  Go read the reviews for the few games that are out for the PlayStation 3 and you will see what I mean about which system has better games to play.  There are already a huge selection of games to play on the Xbox 360 with a whole bunch of new games for the Xbox 360 coming out next year.  Unfortunately, there are not too many new games coming out for the PlayStation 3 or the Nintendo Wii next year. ---  ---  Also, the Nintendo Wii has very poor graphics and you can't play DVD movies on it and the PlayStation 3 has very few games to choose from to play and it also has poor online service.  The Xbox 360 is already one year ahead of the other two systems on being out in the retail market and that, my friend, will make a huge difference on which system to choose from to go out to buy and play. 
Rice Bran is the secret to these products and the results are immediately apparent in the texture of your skin. After just one to two uses, you start to notice a sense of calm and order descending upon your formerly sensitive skin. Weeks later you look at your skin and it seems like you are at least ten years younger. The smoothness, clarity and youthful glow truly shows with continued use.  ---  --- If you have oily or combination skin, you may be amazed at how balanced your skin is and how you no longer experience the shine breakthrough in your makeup due to the initially drying aspects of other cleansers.  ---  --- The Komenuka Bijin Facial Cleansing Foam is very economical and an eighth of a teaspoon is enough for a wonderful face cleansing experience. The ingredients include: Rice Germ Oil, Rice Bran, Coconut Oil, Seaweed, Aloe Algae, Ginkgo Biloba, Matricaria, Yeast, Perilla Ocymoides, Honey, Lithospermum and Fountain Water. ---  --- The Moisture Cream goes a long way. The main oils are Rice Germ Oil, Jojoba Oil and Olive Oil. Vitamin E, Rice Bran and Aloe make this a skin-healing treat. ---  --- Other products to fall in love with:  ---  --- Cleansing Powder - Packets of deep cleansing grains turn silky and creamy when you add water.  ---  --- Makeup Remover - A fragrance-free cream that removes makeup and mascara. Based on olive oil.  ---  --- UV Cream - Slightly tinted and waterproof, this sunblock also seems to even out skin tone. Could be used as a makeup base if you are looking for a more natural look.  ---  --- Hair Shampoo & Conditioner - Thickens fine hair instantly. Removes buildup and leaves your hair feeling luxurious.  ---  --- Essence - This is a product that is magical. It can be used for skin healing and it also lightens freckles and age spots.  ---  --- ~The Rebecca Review
Nice idea for all of us office workers, but the main backing is too soft to provide any real lumbar support. Furthermore, the movable lumbar support is made of the same soft material and is too small and not thick enough to provide any real support. I am looking for something else
La pelicula es mas o menos, pero la banda sonora es buena, en especial la cancion #1 CRUSH de GARBAGE, es una excelente cancion...
The first few days worked great.  I could not finish eating anything, I was full with very little to eat but after a few days the effect wore off.  I work out daily, count carlories and drink at least 74 ounces of water a day.  I did notice a slight difference in my nails and never experienced jitters but that was it.  I did not lose any weight what so ever.  I think this may be good if you want to have a bit more energy but don't expect any weight lost. 
I got this as a gift and registered for it for I was pregnant with my daughter. This was the biggest mistake. The canopy does not cover my daughter when she sits in it. To make it recline, is a chore. My husband has the hardest time to unfold and fold it up, not to make fun of him. he only noce thing is the cup holder comes out to make it easy to take her out. But even still it is not a good purchase and do not buy. We did however buy the peg-pergo piko full size stroller even though it is a littl but more money. Well, worth it. I would suggest that and we also have a macleran light weight stroller and that is also very good.
I love my treadmill!  My son put it together for me and he had no trouble.  I love all the options on this treadmill.  I use only the basic so far, but I can see the benefit in having the pre-programmed workouts.  I can't wait to get there to try it!  ---  --- It's hard to say enough about this machine.  It's a great MACHINE
great casting, dancings and performance. well, if you keep abusing yourself, nobody can save you. this so talented broadway genius simply couldn't himself to mess up many women's lives and stubbornly doing harm to himself, chain-smoking, addicting to prescriptioned drugs, sleeping around, hopping from one woman to another. he created so many personal disasters around himself, dedicated himself to broadway musicals but never took care of himself. burning his own life candle from both ends day and night. when the curtain in the theatre falls, it would go up again in the next evening, but when the curtain of your life decides to come down on you, it won't go up again. a wonderful movie with a hidden warning lesson to those who in the entertaining show biz
This would be a great rebounder, if it were not so cheaply made. --- One month after happily using it, a spring broke, then another. --- It is one of the least expensive models out there and I guess there is a reason for that. Best to save your money and buy a more expensive model
I purchased this seat because of the safety factor that Consumer Reports reported on.  In comparing the seat to Graco Snugride, however, I am very disappointed on the tough, very dense foam on the low back/sacral region of the seat.  The foam goes down to a certain point on baby's low back, and then disappears, leaving a dip for baby's buttocks.  Just imagine sitting in a recliner with support only down to the low-back region (with buttocks not supported) ...not comfortable.  I wonder how a baby's backside would stand up to a traumatic jolt in that seat...well, I'm not going to take any chances.   Baby Trend should have consulted a Physical Therapist (like me) before designing this seat.  
When I tried to upgrade from 2004 to 2005 I ran into a problem because I didn't have Flash 7.0 installed. Actually I had a later version of Flash (9.04) but of course Quickbooks couldn't handle that. Here's the fix: go to the Adobe site and download the uninstall program from them. Uninstall your flash player and then Quickbooks will then proceed. Good luck. Jo
I purchase my total gym and though it did not give me the workout that I expected, It did help me to get firmer and leaner in a short period of time. I wish it offered more of a workout for the legs but overall, I am very happy with my gym and I use it all the time. Only a 20 minute workout 3 times a week made a huge difference in the way I look
Expected more from this movie - although DeNiro was good as usual
This can be used in lieu of a replacement battery.  Plus if an electrical outlet is convienent, like when shooting inside, you never have to worry about running out of power.  Also handy if you are mobile and have a auto dc/ac converter.  But not as overall convienent as an extra battery.  I thought it would also trickle recharge the battery, but it doesn't.  Nikon should add this feature in
very excited to get an alarm at a good deal with free shipping but that all changed when i tried installing two beeps and then nothing i have spent over an hour of tring to get this to work and i tried new fuses but "no go" to sum it up the two orginal beeps is all i got from this product besides stress. NO GO
This DVD-Rom game is so interesting and there are even some questions that I don't know after watching every episode numerous times.  I highly recommend this for Friends fans of all ages, regardless of whether or not you have seen every episode.  Also, I love that the game can be played by only one person, for those nights that you find yourself alone and want a few Friends to keep you company
Like others, I was very pleased (initially) with the very quick installation of this router.  Since I am very familiar with Linksys products, working through the web utility to configure the router is a snap.  I was up an running inside 5 minutes.   Signal strength was awesome, and I had an iMac connected wirelessly with WPA security and an XP machine connected through the ethernet port.   Life was good......... ---  --- After a few days of blissful surfing, I tried to connect a Mac PowerBook pro to the network.   Bad idea -- would not connect unless the wireless security was turned off completely (another bad idea.)  After resetting the router a few times it made the whole system very unstable.   The iMac now loses it's connection every 15 minutes or so.   ---  --- Soooooo, once again I'm resigned to spending fruitless hours on a tech support line to a faraway land.   I purposely stayed with 802.11g because this technology is several years old and SHOULD be rock solid.  I found a forum at [...] that proved to me that many others are having DHCP problems with these routers.   ---  --- There's no excuse for having to spend this much time setting up a very simple network!  If I hadn't already tossed the box, I would be returning it for a refund. --- 
Davy Crockett is one of Walt Disney's most endeared and remembered live action characters from the television and silver screen as personified by Fess Parker. This colorful and entertaining film was re-edited from three segments of Disney's TV show for theatrical distribution. Parker, with his coonskin cap and homespun drawl and witticism created a nationwide phenomenon in 1955. Who can forget "The Ballad Of Davy Crockett" composed by George Bruns and Tom Blackburn. Buddy Ebsen played his sidekick George Russel, whose adventures take them from Tennessee to Washington, D.C. to the Alamo. The film's third act focusing on the defense of the Alamo, though well remembered, is somewhat labored until we see the final image of Davy Crockett passing into legend and glory. This straightforward and beautifully photographed film expounds the virtues of honesty, integrity and bravery. Highly recommended family viewing personally produced by Walt Disney
The price for the item is reasonable. The quality of the item is excellent. The shipping costs aren't displayed on the selling page. The shipping costs are more than the cost of the item. Do not buy with one clic
I had heard of the importance, and significance of "The Education of Henry Adams" for a long time. I finally determined I needed to read it. ---  --- I acutally read it twice, and found less in it the second time than the first.  ---  --- I am sorry  I missed the greatness of this book. I am sure there was something wrong with me, but I found it to be incredibly unimpressive.  ---  --- Perhaps this came from the fact that Henry Adams was not a likeable man. He was famous for holding court in his home near the White House, and making caustic and negative comments about every President who lived there.  ---  --- Granted, he lived in Washington at a time when there were plenty of second-rate occupants of the White House. But the thought of people wasting their time trying to please  a blue-blooded snob like Adams depresses me. Why did anyone bother? He lived in an atmosphere of snobbery, sharp-tongues, clever remarks, and brilliant conversation. The world went on without him, truth be told, and he contributed less than the people who walked by his house each day.  ---  --- He was a very good historian in his time. But who reads his books now? Not very many. In short, his own work was not as long-lasting as he would have wanted it to be. Maybe the influence of some of the Presidents he mocked lasted longer than the published and purchased work of Henry Adams. ---  --- "The Education of Henry Adams" does not have much real information. He got education in one place, none in others. Surely, the suicide of his wife provided some very painful education for Henry--but he wrote nothing about it in his book.  ---  --- When Eric Sevareid wrote "Not So Wild a Dream," it was compared to "The Education of Henry Adams." That was meant as a compliment. Oddly, I think Sevareid's book is much, much better. Sevareid wrote of America, the common man, the war, and what it all meant to him. Adams needed to get out more. He did not see America--not the America built by the common citizen who put it all together, and defended it.  I gained a trememdous amount from Sevareid. I cannot say the same for the work of Henry Adams.  ---  --- Again, a lot of this might be me. Perhaps I read the book at a bad time. Maybe I needed to read it a third time. I do not know. I do know I do not think this is a great American classic. Forgive, please, my ignorance.
I've been reading Men's Journal since the first issue. I've always enjoyed its mix of content. MJ interviews a wide range of interesting individuals. Over the years I've incorporated some of the workout tips from MJ's fitness pages into my workout routine. I especially enjoy reading the product reviews. The travel recommendations are always well written, if not sometimes beyond the budget of most readers (myself included!). Overall, Men's Journal offers a great mix of well written content
No complaints on this one at all - very mild and easy to drink
Following Orson Welles' fascinating yet tantalizing career can be frustrating for the aficionado.  So much of his oeuvre remains hidden from view that each discovery from the archives is greeted with an inordinate amount of enthusiasm.  Take this intriguing yet relatively disappointing collection of documentaries Welles directed for British TV in the 1950s. ---  --- "The missing link in Welles' work," exults the snapcase boilerplate.  This is a bit of an overstatement, given that far more significant works haven't seen the light of day ("Don Quixote" and "The Other Side of the Wind," to name a couple). The documentaries do help to fill the gap in Welles' output for the 1950s, a decade in which he directed only three feature films.  "Around the World" is a good quality DVD and unquestionably the work of Welles, but a ultimately a shadow of what he was capable of.  ---   --- The five episodes on this DVD explore various aspects of European Culture.  Welles takes his camera in search of Basque country, Spanish bullfights, the idiosyncratic denizens of Paris' St Germain des Pres, and the loquacious and venerable Chelsea Pensioners.  The "St Germain des Pres" episode best typifies the offbeat subject matter.  Welles spends most of his time interviewing a commune dweller who makes his own clothes.  After that, Welles dashes through the town, capturing glimpses of celebrities like Jean Cocteau and Eddie Constantine ("Lemmy Caution"), before discovering a group of "Letterists" who are dedicated to (you guessed it) inventing new letters.  ---  --- Unfortunately, Welles' typically low budget and the nature of the subject matter limit his range of cinematic expression.  Despite the exotic and obscure locales, most of the footage consists of relatively static interviews, captured in long takes with obligatory reaction shots of Welles inserted to break up the monotony.  Even the bullfight episode lacks the dynamic footage one might expect; Welles' camera is grounded in the stands, preventing him from getting involved in the action.  Only towards the end of "St. Germain des Pres" and in the second Basque episode does Welles get inventive, developing the active, swirling camera style he employed in films like "Mr. Arkadin."   ---  --- Like a record that's worth owning for one or two songs, "Around the World with Orson Welles" does have one episode that justifies its purchase: the second Basque episode.  True, the first few minutes repeat the introduction from the first Basque show, but after that Welles has a lot of fun interviewing kids playing 'pelote' (a game similar to jai alai).  Welles gets his camera into the pelote action, and seems rejuvenated by the subject matter. An 11-year old boy joins Welles and acts as a tour guide for the rest of the show.  The episode ends dramatically, with Welles quoting a Basque aphorism against a night sky lit by fireworks.  ---   --- For a better example of Welles' creativity in the documentary genre, check out his 1974 essay film, "F for Fake," just released on DVD.  "Around the World with Orson Welles" is a far more pedestrian effort, but it does give Welles fans something to look at while they await the more significant releases that are hopefully on the not-too-distant horizon
Sometimes, you realize you need a watch but don't want to spend a fortune, something that'll last long, is solid, yet fashionable and easy to use. This watch has it all, many times girls have stopped me to see this watch, it is sophisticated, stylish, and only $85 no matter where you go. The metal stays shiny, the glass, virtually scratch proof. Days of the week, military time, day of month (problem with this is it does not know, if month is 30 days or 31, so u have to set it yourself sometimes, but rarely, and worth the effort) I highly reccomend this watch to everyone
I loved this movie. My mom told me about it and i have never heard of it befor so i thought i would check it out. It was great, on all time thiller.
I have used System Works on my computer since 2000. The 2007 version is nowhere as good as the older ones. They have deleted many of the "real" diagnostic features (Registry Optomizer), dummed down the rest, and added (rather forced) an auto-load Norton Protection Center that takes over the Windows Security Center and cannot be easily unloaded. Software should be made to be user-friendly ... this version is nothing like the previous ones
I used a sample and liked the fact that it cleaned my hair the way I want my hair cleaned. ---  Not washed with useless lather and coated with all kind of smoothening silicon products. People have beconme so used to the mass produced garbage that is sold in gorcery stores, that they do not realize they are paying for detergent. In the long run it is damaging for the hair and after some hours it really does not have that nice clean bounce that hair is supposed to have. --- Jonathan is not the only good product out there. I have been using Phyto Shampoo from France and Kiehl's, both don't have the silicon smoothers either and yes, the hair does feel like straw right after you wash it. Get a big tooth comb and some guts and go through life with really clean hair!!!! --- I used my sample and will buy a big bottle of the Shampoo. I have not tried the conditioner, but will try it too.
This is a CLASSIC Christmas movie that you AND your entire family are sure to love.  Check this out...  I PROMISE you that you will not be disappointed
In answer to a music fan from Temple Hills, the song was called King Holiday by the King Dream Chorus & Holiday Crew. It came out on Mercury in 1986 and featured the singers and rappers you mentioned. It made no.30 on the R&B Charts but didn't crossover pop. The lyrics are on the net (try Google) but I don't know if the song still is
Lucky Magazine makes me feel Not so Lucky.  It makes me sad that I can not afford all the items they put in their magazine.  One month they tell me round-toed shoes are in and show me 50 pictures of shoes that I would love to own of which 2 I can afford.  Then the following month Lucky tells me round-toed shoes are out and square-toed shoes are in and show me another 50 pictures.  You get the idea?  This magazine is based on trends and you will be broke if you try to keep up and feel bad if you can't afford all the great things it is showing. ---  --- I did enjoy Lucky for it's profiles on upcoming designers, some great website links, and the one or two affordable items it does toss in each section.  I also got a few ideas on how to wear clothing in new and different ways.   Most of the time, though, I felt sad and envious after I finished reading it.  These are feelings I'd rather not encounter.  I think I would enjoy it more if it were more informative discussing the quality differences in the items they are showing, maybe testing them out in different situations to help me make the best choice in my purchases. --- 
I used it one time, placed it on the charger and it never worked again.  Now I face the added expense to pack and ship back for warranty repair. ---  --- Not happy with my internet purchase from your company.
My family and I tried Omaha Steaks Hamburgers about 6 months ago and have purchased 3 of these picnic packs.  You have never tasted a hot dog until you have tried one of these 3oz dogs!  I would never return to regular grocery store hot dogs!  Definitely worth the money.  The nice feature is that you can order them and have them delivered whenever you want.  Even in warm climates, whatever you order will come in a cooler and packed well with ice.  Order a couple at the beginning of the Summer, and BBQ until your heart is content
It is difficult to use words harsh enough to describe this product and this company. --- I have owned this software for about 80 days.  --- 1. In 80 days of use this product has completely locked up or not opened twice. --- 2. I have called the 'support' line 4 times. The minimum time I was on hold was 40 minutes. --- 3. My initial 'support' period is about to expire and I now will have to pay $200 to get more 'support' --- 4. You have to buy additional software to get your data onto a palm device. ---  --- In summary: The product has locked up about every 40 days and the average hold time is 40 minutes when you call them. ---  --- Save yourself the grief - buy nothing or buy something else
The cord appeared to be pretty messy. But the product is just fine.  ---  --- -Good quality sound. --- -Accept/Hang calls. --- -Volume control. ---  --- I don't think I want more. The connector is a Pop-port connector. It's showed just as big in the product's image. If you have a 2.5mm jack and still insist buying this after look at the image, then what the h... is wrong with you?
I think that the new style of the people are not as nice and durable as the old ones
This item intially fit very well but within 5 weeks I bit a hole in the right side and it came apart and I only wear it 4-6 hours a night. This product is very poor because it is expensive if you have to replace them every 6 weeks or so. I like the design and it doesn't cut up my mouth but I can't be replacing it every other month
I paid $100.00 for a tube of Hylexin because I have serious dark circles.  Unfortunately, I fell for the hype because I would have tried anything that says, "Significantly reduces dark circles!"  I followed the directions and waited....NOTHING!  I teach Business Ehtics at a University.  Part of the course involves ethics in advertising.  I use the Hylexin example of how people are duped by the wording, the packaging, etc. --- Please take my word for it and save yourself some money
I was very disappointed in the product.  The picture does not accurately represent the armoire.  The entire back is just cardboard paneling and the inside of the armoire is white plywood, not cherry wood at all.  The pictures should show the inside view of the cabinet, in addition to the outside.  Also, pieces did come chipped, cracked and one piece was also split into two!!! I returned the item and wish I hadn't ordered in the first place
Being a fan of Russ Meyer movies since classics like "Mudhoney", "Vixen" and "Lorna" it is amazing what happens, when Russ gets some money to make a movie for a major company. Likewise italian competitor Tinto Brass Russ gets in feel with picturing "Erotic" in a slight different way. I liked this movie very much for it's blooming 60's Pop-feeling and great decent inszenation of the participated women. I'm in general a fan of exploitation movies and this one is an especially great one presentated on DVD with a great transfer and lots of extras. Well Done. (Hope my english is half the way understandable, sorry I'm german)  
It never ceases to amaze me how often Gillette comes out with new gimmicks to take more money from it's loyal clientele. ---   --- The Fusion is a classic example, from overpriced shaving gel to a much overpriced razor which quite honestly gives you the same shave as a Sensor Excel. ---  --- Don't buy into the hype, the Fusion is an expensive joke of a product.
I've used the headset for a little over a year and, although plagued with disconnects when idle, was relatively pleased with the sound quality. Not being connected when calls came in was a major annoyance. There was no notice when it disconnected. Recently the plastic ear clip broke and I contacted Logitech and was informed that,since it was over the one year warranty, my only option would be to purchase a new headset; a huge price to pay for a piece that costs pennies. ---  --- Logitech's concern for its customers appears to be nonexistant
I would like to ditto (and thank!) the reviewer who suggested the CVS brand covers.  After reading her review, I purchased the covers from cvs.com . Then I thought about checking at Walgreen's, and sure enough, they carry them (same price as CVS, 40 for $5.99).  I just picked up a box today.  So I will soon have a bunch of covers, but I don't care.  I just love this thermometer.  I actually have the one with the light on it.  Outstanding product
This product is awful, it won't stay together and is very frustrating to both myself and my three year old. What a disappointment.
I LOVE this stuff. I ordered it at a friends Body Shop party a while back. I use it each moring after I shower and it keeps my lips soft all day! I tried to find something like this in the stores but NOTHING even came close to being as good as this!!! I highly reccomend it
Talk about yummy. Another fatty treat from the 'Eat-os' family. It's nice and crunchy and cheesy and deliciously satisfying
I bought this item for my grandaughter whose birthday is in August.  I think she will like it a lot.  I know I did
Accurate, easy to program and good to look at.  Well worth the $ spent
Someone just today told me I should see this film. ---  --- What a disappointment to see these warnings of poor quality DVDs being produced by Fox Lorber. ---  --- Oh well
I loved these guys as a kid. This collection sucks!!! Don't BUY It! The first 3 DVD's are silent and the 5th DVD is a reunion show. The grand total for shows you can actually watch is 4. Take your time and search out the specific shows and characters you love and get them individually. If I could get my money back I would RUN to the nearest post office and return this item ASAP!!
Probably the best cold weather gloves I've purchased.  They are warm without being too bulky.  I have not yet been in low enough temps where I needed to use the battery feature
Absolute waste of money, this is not a Pillow as advertised, in my opinion falsely, but a flat mat which, when filled with water is a very heavy weight and it is not possible to sleep on this. You could use it to wipe your feet on but thats all. An extremely disappointed customer who suffers from overheating badly in bed and thought this was a great solution. Now out of pocket and no better off. 
This toy is not what I had expected. It isn't very durable at all and it's HARD to put together! I don't highly recommend it
I love may cargo organizer.  Rather that have all my stuff slide around in the trunk of my car, I have it all right at my finger tips inside the organizer
We got this bike for our 4 year old, and it is sturdy and rugged enough to last the next few years. The assembly instructions looked intimidating at first, but since many pieces are already pre-assembled you can skip most of them. It was a lot easier than anticipated. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars: It had a deep scratch/paint chip on the frame. But since I got this during a sale for a great price and considering it was needed the next day we kept it anyway
Purchased the Batman Laptop Computer at Target for Christmas for my grandson who is not quite 5 years old.  He was totally drawn in because it is Batman....but the games kept his interest. The entire family enjoyed trying the different games. Dad, a musician, enjoyed the music game. Graphics are super... I love the way Batman gives his approval with a thumbs up when you get the answer right....and the cool light inside that allows you to adjust from green to red. Grandma played in the dark with grandson for fun even. Worth the $38.99 I paid at Target on sale for sure. 
I use these socks for running and they are very well cushioned and comfortable. they also withstand frequent laundry without loosing quality. 
I purchased the Adorama Slinger Bag after first purchasing the Tamrac Velocity 5.  The Tamrac bag is a nice bag and can be worn as either a shoulder bag or a waist bag. Unfotunately, it lacked sufficient support when worn as waist bag and did not have an attached pouch to carry a water bottle.  The Slinger Bag addressed both of these deficiencies.  When worn as a waist bag, it also uses the shoulder strap to keep the bag firmly in place which also helps to balance the weight of the bag.  There are two water pouches on the Slinger Bag (which is a real requirement as I live in Arizona). ---  --- The Adorama Slinger Bag is a great travel bag. It is light weight and has great utility.  I highly recommend it.
Had 3 leaks all in the seams! Could not patch correctly even after waiting the "30 mins." to re-infalte like the directions stated. My son was extremely upset. From other reviews, it sounds like there is a 50/50 chance of getting a good product
I'm holding on the phone right now trying to get support for this product.  There is no 800 number for tech-support, so it's a long distance call.  I have had the same issue for over a month and still have not been transferred to a tech support person.  They offer only email support, but don't write back.  If you call them on the phone they tell you a support person will call you, but it never happens
The bed looks very nice.. [...] when you have a toddler who is starting to climb out of their crib..This probably won't make it in the reviews but I'm writing it anyway
After two no-brand aftermarket cables which were invisible to the phone and Nokia Phone Suite, this cable and the included software driver worked perfectly. (Note: Nokia Phone Suite must be separately downloaded, but is free of charge.) ---  --- We have uploaded photographs from our Nokia 6102i to our computer and added phone numbers from the computer keyboard to the phone. ---  --- Nokia has gone to pains to ensure that you buy an expensive cable. I recommend pricing accessories before selecting your next phone. Some Motorola phones accept a universal mini-USB cable which I believe is cheaper
               I am the Star Wars Fanatic ---  --- I really like this toy! It has firing misiles and stickers to put on the vehicle. And, you can open the wings! This is a great toy! --- 
First of all, I want to make the point that this is a strategy based tycoon game and a sim game.  It is really well done using superb graphics and animations.  You get to apply new discoveries in your factories so you can make a better product and out sell them to your competitors.  It all seems to be based on real history so you get information from real sources like the Wright brothers, Edison and even Einstein. And you also have to worry about the people that work in your factories, your scientists, and accountants and even worry about industrial espionage. If you like business, engines, buildings, science and physics, you'll be getting hours and hours of play out of this game.  You also get to play in a bunch of different cities in the world.  Each one has different challenges. It's fresh every time you play since you can do things differently and see how the results vary
These are a fun little snack. They taste good and are crunchy, so you can pass on the potato chips.  They have two grams of fiber and a small amount of vitamins.  They are not low in calories, so be careful of the amount you eat.  My daughter likes them, which is a plus.  The price was good at Amazon, but the shipping was steep. 
This oolong simply tastes richer and fresher than any other my husband and I have tried.  We live in the hinterland of Utah without any variety of oolong teas on most market shelves, so we are happy to purchase it online.
I have used DOS, Win3.1, Win95, Win98 and now this piece of crap OS. Microsoft's only interest is making money, thats why they come out with a new release of an OS upon a new release of an OS. Each one just as buggy, insecure and unstable as the previous version. --- Anything coming from Microsoft just plain sucks. --- I have now switched from InterCrap explorer to Mozilla and from Out-Crash-express to Thunderbird, soon I will completely switch to Linux, a FAR better and FUNCTIONAL OS for a far better price, namely free. My next laptop will be a Mac. --- Dont waste your money, Microsoft designed software is garbage by definition. And for the person saying he can understand we are not all geeks : I shouldnt HAVE to be a frigging geek to use an O
I purchased this to work with my Xbox 360, I wanted to try this cable type with my new Onkyo 7.1 home theater since I was using the old composite for sound. I heard more disortion and fuzz then if you but a soda can in a blender. I qucikly ran to Best Buy to buy a Monster fiber optical cable it was about 50.00 dollars more. But then the sound was incredible I couldn't beleive what I was hearing. I gave it two stars since the cables build was so so but not half as thick as Monsters. (Maybe I got a bad model give it a shot it's only a couple dollars)
I love these magazines.  We subscribe to Ladybug, Spider, and Cricket (each for a different child).  The stories are great, as is the illustration.  An illustrator friend of mine says that it is very prestigious to be asked to illustrate a story in these magazines, and I figure it is the same for the stories.  No advertising, of course.  The thing I like the best is that each magazine is geared toward a certain age of child.  Highlights tries to be something for everyone, so we look through the magazine to find an appropriate story.  In Ladybug, we just start at the beginning and read straight through.  As the publisher will tell you, when your child outgrows Ladybug, you just let them know and they change your subscription to Spider (and later, Cricket.  That's as far as we've gotten)
I love this swing - my fussy first child could not live without it.  I had my second child two years later and the swing is now really loud. I called Fisher Price and they said that the motor will wear out with use.  So now mine sounds like a metronome - it clicks back and forth.  If I had to do it all over again - I would still buy this swing b/c of the design.  I just wish that FP would build a motor that was more durable and better yet - that plugs into the wall
Almost every time I wear "Curve" I get comments from the ladies, a very good thing.  I currently have 10 different types of cologne and I wear this one a lot.  It seems good and the scent lasts throughout the day without having to drench yourself in it
The filter is small compared with most other systems; has a sturdy, metal fixture and pull-knob activator; filters quickly with plenty pressure; and of course it has the great Culligan taste
Easy on the back and shoulders, as this is very light. It does a good enough surface job until the weekend vaccuuming. My 2 year old daughter loves to use it to help mommy! I bought this in a drug and discount store for $13.95. It's worth that
Any one of the first 4 cuts on this album are worth the price of admission.  These pieces, each melodically rich and honed like a fine gem, remind me more of classical romanticism than what normally passes for "New Age".  Sit back in a cosy armchair with a glass of wine and let this beautifully-crafted music weave its web...it's "feel good" music that also has an intellectually satisfying bittersweet flavor
We have 2 kids in a 2-bedroom apartment.  When our 2nd child was born, we put him in our bedroom.  There is not much space there, so this portable crib was a great find!  We use it as a permanent crib until our son outgrows it.    ---  --- Pros: saves space, folds, easy to move from room to room (on wheels), really easy to change the sheets (compared to regular crib with heavy matress).  It also has very neutral color and style, so it fits really well with other traditional furniture. ---  --- Cons: the baby will outgrow it in about 1 year, the matress is extremely thin (about 1 inch!).  We bought an extra matress (the normal thickness) for about $20.  To find it, do a search for "portable crib matress"
I really love this gift set..you will smell sooo yummy!!  At first when I put it on it smelled so familiar, then my husband and I decided it reminds us of sweet cotton candy..we love it!  Although now I am getting hooked on Amazing Grace...also a familiar, clean, fresh, scent. Philosophy is great
I love this battery charger!  I used to use store bought AA batteries for my Olympus digital camera, but after keeping the batteries in the camera for only a week, the batteries were drained of power.  For some reason, this twin battery pack can stay charged for a few months if I am just storing my camera.  Highly recommended
This Similar Unit is 1/4th the Cost of the Official Phone Belt Clip that Verizon Sells for the LG VX 8300, and it is JUST AS GOOD. ---  --- Verizon Sells it for $19.99 + Tax ---  --- Amazon Vendor Sells it for $.01 + $4.99 Shipping ---  --- Bottom line, it is just a Piece of Plastic that gets the Job don
I am amazed what this program can do. It is a big difference from PS 5.5. It is a new learning curve but well worth it. What used to take me hours to do is now an action and done in 2 minutes. Amazon had the best price for me from a source I trust ordering from. It is worth it
This flash is the perfect back-up for a studio, or Main/flash fill for an amateur studio.  I use several w/slaves and lines and the images rival set-ups that cost thousands of Dollars.  I like that they are light and easy to pack and transport.  They are reasonably priced.  They have been around for a long time and do not have bells and whistles.  The SUNPAK has auto/f-stop and manual.  If you are a real photographer, you will know how to use them.  The down side is that if your SUNPAK is plugged into a wall, it takes far too long to recharge (sometimes 3-5 seconds).  Rechargeable batteries seem to work the best with 1-3 second recharge times between flashes. 
If your tired of all the first person shooters and RPGS... This game rocks.. It was 1990 all over again for me.. Love the game.. Since i didnt have anm original playstation I can only comment that the 3d effects they added in this version make the game more appealling for me :) The only issue I have is that you cant play 2 player.. But i can forgive that.
Every once in a while a product comes along that does one thing, and does it really well. The only question is "do you need it" With modern LCD screens and sleep/energy save modes, screen savers are virtually unnecessary. That's really the point of Aquazone, it has no practical value, but it is very cool. ---  --- Before we got our little dog Tova, we had a fish tank for a number of years. I do miss some of the relaxing aspects of watching fish swim around and interact. Fish are generally low maintance and considered by many a key stress reducer. I think of this screen saver program as a virtual tamagotchi or a aquatic version of the Sims. You can do everything you would do with a normal fish tank: add and remove fish, feed them, tap on the glass (or the keyboard in this case). Even better, you can mix fresh water and salt water, no worries about two male Betas in the same tank Fortunately you don't have to clean the tank and you don't get algae. If you want fish not included in the tank, you can buy some more online --- If you ( or someone you know) enjoys fish and want to buy something fun and rather frivolous, this is a great program. If you aren't into fish, probably not worth buying ---  --- Pros: Does exactly what is says, creates a virtual fish tank --- Cons: Probably a productivity waster at the office, gotta love fish to enjoy the program
The story of "Hansel and Gretel" is more than a warning against children talking to strangers (or trying to eat their houses).  The recurring image of the forest in German fairy tales is a supernatural world where interesting things happen, while the fact the father of Hansel and Gretel is a woodcutter is significant because this was one of the lowliest occupations at that time.  Therefore, what we have here is the triumph of the poor working class characters over the witch and her upper class pretentions (she stores not only treasure but food), which would make her death some sort of proto-Marxist warning if you are ideologically inclined in that direction. ---  --- In the original manuscript of the story of the siblings were referred to as Little Brother and Little Sister.  The Brothers Grimm chose Hansel because it was a common name in German fairy tales (their equivalent of John Doe so to speak) and picked Gretel for essentially the same reason (which makes her Jane Doe).  Gretel (or Gretchen) is a form of the name Margaret, which in Latin (Margarita) means "pearl."   ---  --- All that background makes it rather ironic that for its Twisted Fairy Tale series McFarlane Toys has turned Gretel into a German princess, striking a pose that suggests "Getting lost in the woods is the least of her worries."  This six-inch figure has tattoos, a spiked collar around her neck, and torn fish net stockings.  There are more details for you to discover when you look over the figure carefully, and while she is not exactly a princess of bondage, Gretel appears to be familiar with the neighborhood.  She also has a mop and a pail, and there is ample reason to think she knows how to use them (the mind reels at the possibilities for rewriting the Grimms tale). ---  --- Twisted Fairy Tales is the fourth series of McFarlane's Monsters, and the rest of the menagerie consists of not only Gretel's tag team partner Hansel, but Red Riding Hood, Peter Peter Pumpkin Eater, and Little Miss Muffet.  If you were aware about the probable origins of a lot of the classic fairy tales then you already knew that Mother Goose had a twisted sense of humor.  With these figures McFarlane Toys certainly takes being twisted to the next level.  Even if you do not want the entire set, there should be one of these figures that captures the Jungian dark side of the tales that we were all raised on once upon a time that most appeals to you
  After purchasing the program thinking it would perform a through check on my Presario running XP Home all I get is a message that SSP6 has unexpectedly quite. I emailed tech support w/ the info, but so far no response after 10 days. There is no # to call for support. Maybe I overlooked something.  ---   Also, I submitted the rebate form which came on the package, but was told that the seller was not participating in the rebate program and I need to check w/ them. I did and they said they shipped what VCOM had provided them, which included a rebate form if doing a competitive upgrade. ---   Not very impressed w/ either the software or the company. Would never buy another product from these guys, even when the price after rebate is 0. LOF
My baby had very bad reflux and pediatrician told us not to move her to her room, my fear was that she would get use to sleep in our bedroom and moving her became a nightmare. When reflux got better at month 4 We finally got to move her and for us this monitor became a very useful tool, it has rechargeable batteries, image and sound are clear enough, night vision works perfect, monitor is not bulky at all (no color at all though), and we managed to tie camera to the crib's headboard and worked great for us.
This item was a nice gift.  The stones were a little discolored, but that's what you get for only paying $100 for 1/4 carat earings online :
To my knowlege, there simply isn't a better equipped camera for the professional investigator.  It's IR-sensitive mode (nightshot) is in B&W (rather than cheeseygreen), far superior quality-wise to anything Sony's got, and it's the only 3CCD that I know of with a low-light mode.  The image stabilization is exceptional and the image quality is production grade.  Time/Date stamps can be "burned in" so they xfer via firewire - again, the only camera I'm aware of with this feature.  The audio can be turned off which we know is a must.  And best yet, you can disable the sleepmode so it won't turn off eliminating missed money shots waiting for the camera to cycle back on.  It's built like a tank and feels substantial in the hand, but it's still lightweight thanks to an alloy frame.  Finally, it's totally silent even with the tape transport in full swing.   ---  --- The ONLY downside so far as I can tell is it's size - It's a big camera compared to the handicams I've had, and wouldn't be well suited for close-proximity work.  However, the black casing dosn't print/siloutte terribly, and the 16x optical lets you set back quite a bit. ---  --- Highly recommended! --- 
This movie is watchable, but barely. Its not on the same level of the other chainsaw versions....and see leatherface as a....never mind, youll --- have to see for yourselves. We have a yound Renee Zellweger in this one. 
Love Hush Puppies.  They are comfortable and I can get a heel low enough for me to be comfortable
THE FLASH WORKS VERY WELL, I DO WEDDING PHOTOGRPHY SO I NEED A GOOD FLASH.  IT WORKS GREAT. I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT
I have played Call of Duty 2 through and through.  I have unlocked all the achievements and now I feel kind of sad.  I want more.  This game is simply fantastic, from the graphics to the gameplay.  I actually felt like I was thrown back in time to fight the Nazi.  Fire fights and be intense, since enemy units are not retarded.  They will use cover effectivly and will even try and get better postioning on you.  It may seem like no big deal but game developers have been promising smart AI for years and never deleviring until now.   ---  --- I unfortunitly do not have the ability to play on Xbox Live so the muliplayer is very limited for me... what I have play is fantastic.  Its not ground breaking and the lack of vehicles is kind of crappy... but no big deal. ---  --- Okay... if you have an Xbox 360 you might as well get this game.  Its the best I have played so far
I'm not a system analyst, so I need really clear instructions for any new device. I bought this camera 1 year ago to use as a home security camera which I could view from the Internet at my office.  --- Troubles I encountered:  --- 1.) Set up was impossible. I finally figured out that I had to disable the wep on my wireless network thus inviting all my neighbors to free Internet connection. I wasn't willing to do this.  --- 2.) I could view from the Internet within my home network, but not from my office.  --- 3.) Had to convince one of my company's IT system analysts to visit me at home and trouble shoot the camera's system. Took her 3 hours of guess work but she successfully set it up and keep my network secure-- which worked until I had to reset my router. 2 weeks of use in one year. --- 4.) I have never been able to have the camera send "snap shots" to my e-mail or ftp folder. D-Link tech support confirmed that I was setting it up correctly... but the feature doesn't work. I was told by D-Link tech support that I may need to disable my Internet security program. No can do. --- 5.) D-Link tech support may not have access to this product- they are not able to respond to my inquiries. They would send me answers- but not to the questions I asked! --- 6.) The weather protection cover is not designed for wireless antenna and has been out of stock each time I have tried to purchase- so I have not been able to install on the outside of my home. It therefore must be used inside which is not what I need. I could have paid < $80 for an indoor camera.   ---  --- Every so often, when I have a few hours to burn, I drag it out and try to make the thing work. For the couple weeks it was viewable on the Internet it provided a nice view of my home, but it wasn't useful without snapshots or any type of archived image documentation.  
I viewed this film a few years ago when I had nothing to do and found this to be a masterpiece.  Luis Buñuel's direction is unique.  I found that the main character's desposition changes his love for the woman.  When she gets him angry, we see one woman.  When she makes him happy, we see a different woman in the same character.  I don't think I've seen a movie quite like this.  This movie will stay with you for some time, especially if you have a broken heart.   --- 
Based on Bram Stoker's Dracula and Murnau's movie, the film is extremely beautiful and the sequence  of the woman crossing the square where they celebrate a final feast is impressive
Why doesn't Amazon allow people to sell *used* lettuce? I bought "To Kill a Mockingbird" used last week via amazon and saved about 90% off the original price. I don't think it's fair that they are not allowing us to sell it used via Paypal.
I bought this title because the first Typing Instructor For Kids got such good reviews.  I was looking for a way to teach my 8yo son keyboarding.  He has always had a terrible time with handwriting.  I knew I needed really easy, slow-paced typing instruction for him, or he wouldn't get it. ---  --- Well, it's 6 months later and he can now type!  We did it with nothing but this software.  I made him practice about 10 min/day 5 - 7 days/week.  All in all, he found it to be work to learn this new skill, but still rather enjoyable. ---  --- There are 11 games included and several of them are very good -- meaning they are really fun AND build typing skills at the same time.  There is also a series of drills, lessons, and typing tests to teach the keyboard.  The keyboard is introducted a few keys at a time, and then you repeat the related drills, lessons, tests, and games until those keys are learned fairly well.  I had to require my son to keep repeating each section of the keyboard until he could do it at 15 wpm before letting him go to the next section.  This is what the software recommends, but I had to learn it the hard way.  At first, I let my son go ahead too fast and he ended up getting overwhelmed.  I ended up having to put a sticker chart on the wall and offering him prizes for getting to 15 wpm on each section. ---  --- I would recommend this software for children from 6 to about 11.  The cartoon characters are very juvenile and would probably offend a child any older than that.  However, for any adolescent or adult able to ignore the juvenile cartoons, this would be an excellent way to learn to type too.  I found that my typing skills improved just by occasionally using this software. --- 
My kids got these from Grandpa.  They love them!  They're fun to bowl with in a dark room.  We've clipped them onto headboards for a decent-sized reading light. ---  --- The problems: The clip is pretty hard to operate, even for an adult.  Also, the plastic base broke on each of our lights (in different places), so now they're clip-less.  They're still well-loved and well-used by the little guys, though.   ---  --- I recommend these lights, but be careful w/ the bases
This is one of the most fun games I've every played.  There are tons of belly laughs as people try to bluff their way through an answer to a question.  I find the questions (and answers) are quite educational too, I've learned a lot from these questions.  A group of family members played at Christmas (6 of us) and it was hilarious to watch some people try to come up with an answer to the question (a bluff).   We even let our 5 year old nephew "play" and he was pretty good with coming up with some bluffs.  Try it, it is loads of fun.  I recommend a group of at least 4 though
I saw this crapfest in the theater and I should have known what I was getting into when we were carded not only at the ticket window, but at the entrance of the theater as well.  I only gave it one star because there wasn't a "no star" rating--even though it deserves a negative rating.   ---  --- As a horror fan, I was intrigued at seeing the movie and as the movie started, it seemed to have alot of promise.  But once we met Baby and her "family" the movie went downhill at an accelerated rate.  The movie was disgusting, repulsive, and made no clear sense--at least with Michael or Freddie you knew what the h*ll was going on.  And I thought that Blood Sucking Freaks and Blood Sucking Vampires from Pittsburgh sucked, but Corpses not only sucked, it blew. As a friend told me later, "What in the h*ll did you expect from Rob Zombie?"  What did I expect indeed.  No wonder most production firms refused to touch this film
I bought this product to hang a 42" LCD. --- I am pleased with this mount but there are some concerns.  The mount is only 32" wide.  The "virtual axis" tilt is basically a clip that can be added on to obtain a 5 degree tilt which working perfect for me.  There are only two tilt options with this mount, vertical (hugs wall nicely) and the 5 degree.  Being 32" wide you will not hit 3 studs if they are 16" centers.  Make sure you get at least 2 studs.  My experience is this mount does not support VESA 400x800mm pattern.  800mm is ~31.5 inches and the brackets can not be spaced more than ~30 apart.  My TV did have another attaching pattern but I had to use the M5 bolts (provided with mount).  I would feel safer if this mount did support the 800 spacing where I could use the thicker M8 bolts.  A 42" LCD isn't going to weigh as much as a 50"+ TV, so take that into consideration.  I am still pleased with this product as it is very sturdy.
Ok so my daughter was 2 3/4 and not 3 (toy rated for age 3), but she loves Elmo and loves playing with this toy. It is somewhat loud an there is no volume control. Also after 4 months of use the pen stopped working, rendering the toy worthless. Also the binding is weak and my daughter has torn the sheets with normal use. So fun toy while it lasts
My wife and I have used this a few times now and really like it.  From a novice's point of view, this is a great meditation aid.  I like being able to get the visual feedback as I calm and center myself.  I guess the hardest part is not letting myself get too anxious as I try to accomplish the task in front of me.   ---  --- It's also a very pretty game with very lush and detailed visuals as well as a nice soundtrack
We purchased this item for our 15 year old daughter when we spent a week in the Keys. The DVD gave her a good overview of how to use the mask/snorkel. The mask and snorkel were of good construction and kept water out. This was a great product and a good price for what we needed and used it for.
I'd give this movie a negative star if I could.  AVOID this movie. It's terrible. Not one positive thing could be said about this movie
Product arrived in superb condition and got here 2 weeks before I thought that it would.  What a smooth transaction!!
This album sparked the so-called "Neo-Soul" movement years before it was adopted by other artists. Back in early 1986 everything was about synthesizer overkill and Prince broke the music back down to its roots. This concept was later used by Tone Tony Toni, Brand New Heavies, and D'Angelo.
The company/shipping was fine.  No beefs there.  The product itself I find to be rather damaging to the skin.  In order to extract, you have to press down EXTREMLY hard, (If you can even locate what your attempting to extract w/that darn pin hole at the end.)  I can't imagine this wouldn't leave scars.  I wouldn't reccomend this product. I just put it in the drawer, never to be used again.  :
The humor is definitely not in the book - reviews and summaries use the word "hilarity" however, I did not come across any situation that I would classify as even funny,  not to mention hilarious.  I thoroughly enjoyed her first novel, Pink Slip, however, this one seemed depressing.  The two main characters appeared to have no respect or show any outward love toward each other until the very end of the story.  The plot seemed to be very SLOW - the whole story took place in a matter of days, but really, nothing took place in the book.  All in all, they bought a house.  I would pass on this for better reads elsewhere
My husband was revolted by the smell of this product.  I have bad sinuses, so it didn't bother me.  As far as effectiveness goes, there are no miracle ingredients in this concoction.  I used it everyday, several times a day, and noticed no lasting improvement in the look or feel of the skin on my hands.  At a cost of almost $20 for 8.5oz., I got skunked
I purchased two scarves and in the first washing the thread in the hems unraveled, producing a ragged fringe all around.  These bandanas are thin, flimsy, and not worth the time or money
This book covers all the elements of Game Theory, emphasizing intuition over mathematical formalism.  The philosophical aspects are also given a thorough  treatment.    The 8 appendices provide a more formal exposition  of several key concepts such as the Minmax Theorem, the geometry of  equilibria and Linear programming.  The book has not changed much since its  publication in 1957, but it is by no means  archaic.      Even for those  who have a modern and more rigorous textbook,  "Games and  Decisions" is  Highly recommended  as a supplement. There is something  for everyone in it
Satisfied with the overall quality of the product. Also with the purchase process
My husband was very happy to receive this gift.  He loves the Mothers products
This product is excellent.  It will make it much easier on your back and also time efficient. 
Graber should be ashamed of themselves for this product... This rack will scrape the paint right off your bike; the arms of the rack that fold closed pop out of place with a bike on the rack sliding your bike around; the rack itself does not stay in place despite trying bungee cords, ratchet tie-downs, etc.  This was a complete and total waste of money - AND damaged my bike.  On top of all that, it is NOT an inexpensive rack!  Save yourself aggravation and choose a different rack..
It is heavy duty, and it is easy to read with big lettering and it will fit people with a large wrist such as mine
Like said in an earlier review, after a couple weeks the mirror quits working and fogs up so bad you can't see a thing in it in the shower.  I run hot water on it and it still fogs up after a couple minutes, then you can't clear it with any method.  Total waste, not worth a dollar. 
We bought two different kinds of Gates for our living room area.  We bought the Kidco Configure gate and the Kidco Elongate.  ---      The elongate was to cover an area of 84".  The elongate can only go straight across and opening.  It's extension are screwed together and have an overlap. So the gate is not actually straight across.  We are very disappointed in this purchase and wished we had bought two Configure gates.  Took us some time to screw the extension in and then to screw the supports in and then to mark it on the wall.  Took us over an hour. ---      The Configure gate is on the pricey side.  We almost did not buy it.  But it has two different size extension pieces and you can bend and configure it to the space you need.  We use it at the bottom of our stairs and it bows out to give you an area so that the gate is not up against the stairs. ---      It was so easy to add the extension piece on.  You just snap out the pole and add the extension piece.  You can bend the gate different ways to fit in the opening. ---      To Mount on the wall you just mark the screw holes and screw in the plate then snap the gate on.  It was mounted on the wall in less then 20 minutes.  It was very sturdy. ---      I highly recommend this gate.
I purchased two chairs, one for me and one for my husband. For me the chair is perfect. I weight about 110 but my husband who is about 270 it is not so good!! (Chair is way to small for him) I love it for myself because when I take my children to the beach it is very easy for me to carry along with all the other beach accessories!! I would recommend it for someone looking for a light weight chair that is easy to bring along places
Square Enix is going back in time with their latest Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS titles. First we had Final Fantasy 1 and 2 on the GBA which were brilliant recreations of the original Nintendo Entertainment System titles that started the Final Fantasy series way back when. Then last year we had the first SNES Final Fantasy game in Final Fantasy IV Advance on the GBA which recaptured the fun that really made the series a house hold staple keeping the game the same as we remember with extras added in to make it even more fun then we remembered. Final Fantasy III which was a Japanese only exclusive NES game is now on the Nintendo DS introducing a new yet old game to fans old and young. ---  --- Now with thier next title in Final Fantasy V, will Square Enix again capture the magic that made their old games so much fun? The answer is absolutely yes! ---  --- This game is a great example of why the job class system, that Final Fantasy has become well known for, is so much fun to interact with. You start out with a team of four who have to save four special elemental crystals from being destroyed. Every time a crystal does happen to be destroyed the crystals will lend the would be heroes it's powers letting them change thier classes into more powerful fighters, magic users and specialist in the hopes of saving various worlds from a great evil in the name of Exdeath.  ---  --- The story can be a bit on the weakside. Besides the point of fighting evil just because they are good guys and that's what good guys do there is not much more to the story then your typical Final Fantasy situation. The real draw of the game is the idea of building your dream team of characters in the classes you want to build them into. Some of the classes most will be familiar with if you have played a Final Fantasy Tactics game. There are some new and unique ones but over all they all have their pro's and con's and let you switch between them easy enough while being able to use previously learned abilities from one job into another job.  ---  --- There are your typical classes in the Knight, Black Mage, White Mage, Monk and Thief. While there are more obscure job titles like Berzerker, Dancer, Beastmaster and Bard that add a lot of originality and newness to the game as it lets you be classes that you may have never thought of being in a Final Fantasy world.  ---  --- A lot of the game will focus around you leveling up due to the fact that the only way to learn new skills for your current classes are to gain job points by winning battles. Also it can get quite expensive buying equipment for all the different classes as a lot use very specific weapons like whips bows and axes while most use swords and daggers. So this game is not one that you will be able to rush through quickly if you want to get the full experience out of it.  ---  --- Overall this is a great addition to any fan of a good RPG series both young and old. The story is the only weakness as it could have been a bit better but the fun of the game and your own ability to choose what type of fighters you want to use at any given time make you forget quickly of the story going on and keeps you focused on the action and having fun with the many classes to find.  ---  --- With three worlds, over 20 class choices, bonus classes and dungeons not found in the original games and so much more to do in this game you definitely can't go wrong picking this up. A very worthy, yet not as well known game in the long running Final Fantasy series.  ---  --- Especially with Final Fantasy VI Advance on the way, this is a great way to pass the time until it becomes available. This isn't the greatest Final Fantasy game, but it seems to fit in perfect to the portable setting it has been put into. Get it today so you too can max out all the job abilities for all the characters.
I recently purchased this booster as well as the Britax Starriser booster seat (I have two cars/two toddlers and an infant).  My children argue over who gets to ride in the Starriser.  For some reason they are not as comfortable in the Parkway.  My theory is that it is too much like a car seat rather than a booster -- and they feel "too snug" in it.  They even look uncomfortable in it. The one advantage of the Parkway over the Starriser is the increase neck protection if they should fall asleep.  If I had to do it over, I would have purchased two of the Starrisers instead of the Parkway. BTW, I purchased the Britax Companion for my infant and I LOVE it
My all-around favorite lens in the Canon EOS system is the 50/1.4.  I find that most of the time, most of the pictures I want to take can be achieved using hte 50mm focal length, and the fast aperture allows me to take photos in low light. ---  --- I bought the 24-70/2.8 in hopes of getting high quality images from a zoom lens, as a lot of my pictures weren't in particularly dark places, and the flexibility to get a little wider or closer sounded appealing. ---  --- I was not disappointed. ---  --- The image quality produced by the 24-70/2.8 is outstanding.  Great color, great sharpness.  It might not make images quite as striking as Canon's 135/2 lens, but they are very good indeed. ---  --- Does this lens replace the 50/1.4?  No way.  The 50 is a lot smaller, weighs a lot less, and is still much better for low light shooting.  But for photographing events where you don't want to lug around several prime lenses or go to extreme lenghts to frame the shot better, the 24-70 can be a great tool
My 16 month old loves her new groceries.  The produce &amp; sandwich parts are plastic &amp; each piece has a wonderful texture. The canned goods are very interesting to read.  They are actually labeled by a supermarket in the UK, so they are a bit different from the groceries you would find in the US.  I put the cardboard frozen food items away until she is older. She has been entertained at length because each piece is so intricate.  This was a great purchase. 
I absolutely loved this DVD.  I saw in on TV, but wanted a permanent edition for my 'supes' collection.  I highly recommend it for anyone interested in the history of Superman, its origins and where he fits into our culture today.  It's great
Don't waste your money. That's the short version. No stars for this P.O.S. Want more? OK - once you've fiddled around and fitted the rubber strips to your window, hooked on the device, rolled up your window (facing the sun, of course) you're now late for whatever it was you just parked to go do. Oh yes, and it doesn't do anything other than spin a joke fan that couldn't move a feather. I put my hand in front of it and felt nothing - no wonder my car still feels like an oven. We can't drive off with it on, as the wind noise is unbearable even after unhooking the unit. Why? Because of the 'sealing' rubber strip you've hooked over the top of the glass leaving a nice 4mm gap for the wind. --- I thought I was smart going on ebay and buying two for the price of one. I would have been smarter spending the money on lottery tickets
These cookies are superb all by themselves. Far superior to "that other sandwich cookie" in every way. But if you really want to tip the scale into complete decadence, melt some Ghirardelli Double Chocolate Chips in your double boiler, and dip these cookies, then remove to a rack to dry. Your friends will all think you got them at some fancy chocolate store, and beg you for more. Keep out of reach of children
It helps you dry and burns the wattery thing inside your face out. --- This is a non toxic device used to heat up the pimples until it get small and dry. --- This product is better than Proactiv.  --- Proactive does not work on my face instead it irritates and get worst. --- Try to wash your face with Dove skin soap for more than 1hr to soften your face and remove the pus. Then, path it dry and use Zeno, and don't over use this product because it might hurt and burn your skin. --- Failure to use this product properly might cause 1st Degree burn. ---  --- Never use any chemicals on your face while using this product. ---  --- For excessive large pimples, I see some people apply a clean duct tape on their face, keep it for 3-8 hrs and remove it. --- You would notice that all pus are lying on your face and you just need to clean it using clean water and a skin soap. ---  --- The regular price of this product is $150 for 60 Treatment Cycle. --- 
I hesitate to write a review about a food because, well, one man's meat is another man's poison ...  I like the not-too-sweet and minimally processed taste of this brand; the Banana flavour is our favourite.  The Fruit and Nut flavour lacks a little oomph and the fruit inside is too tangy for my taste buds (so maybe TOO minimally processed?).  Also, remember that 'All Natural' is NOT organic, even if you find this in the health food section of your grocery store.  Our local Target also carries this brand of granola and has the best price for it
This contains 16 servings, which means it will last you half a month.  That's pretty expensive when you break the price down by serving and whne compared with a 1 month supply of the flax capsules that costs $7.  However, liquid flax oil is a lot more concentrated than the pills you buy at the store.   --- A flax oil pill typically contains 1000mg of flaxseed oil and a suggested dosage of 2-3 times a day.  So with pills you're getting 2-3g of flax oil a day.  With liquid flax oil, you're getting 14g of flax.   ---  --- If you are buying this for it's purported treatment of acne, sunburn, diverticular disorders, hemorrhoids, and more serious health conerns, it's probably best to consume the liquid flax oil.  If you just want the benefits of lower cholesterol and heart disease prevention, a pill a few times a day, combined with fish oil should be all you need. ---  --- It's definitely easier though to take a spoonful of this in the morning than 3 flax pills a day, and when you loook at value, you're getting 224g of flax oil in this bottle when compared with a typical 100g in a 100 pill bottle of the capsules.  It all depends on what you need it for
My primary camera is a Sony HDR-FX1. --- I bought the GL-2 as a second unit for multiple camera angles at sporting events. --- The GL-2 is a respectable camera but in my opinion the video image doesn't even come close to the Sony. --- The price and rebate offer was the greatest incentive in my purchase of this camera. --- However, beware of the rebate offer. --- I sent all the documents in strict compliance with the terms of the rebate only to have it rejected. --- The rebate facilitator claimed I did not include the UPC code. --- If I had it to do over, I would dig deeper into my wallet and buy a second Sony
This game is very fun and has lots of action that is for sure.  Many people may find this good enough for the game to satisfy them, but I am not one of them.  The mythology part is good and the creatures and gods are described and portrayed very well, but the plot to the campaign messes it all up.  The last campaign was much larger and it was more fun.  I was disappointed in the new campaign.  I'd say the first one is better.  If you make a big deal about graphics though, than this game is for you.  It has excellent graphics and features.  The ocean and mountain looks so realistic.  They do a good job showing you underwater.  These graphics blow away the graphics of the Age of Empires series.  If you were expecting a good campaign, your not going to be very happy.  Plot isnt so good and its very short.  It has about half of the other games campaigns.  A big difference is that in normal games the titans always come out.  They're kind of annoying.  Overall this game is good but not as good as the prequal. ---  --- Graphics-10/10 --- Campaign Plot-3/10 --- Music-6/10 --- Mythology-9/10 --- Overall-7/10
usually jerry's scores for movies are priceless,(i.e. the other score for "legend")but rudy is a little bit too unoriginal and the feelings meant to be expressed seem much too"forced" for my taste.it's ok as a weird sort of comedy album,I suppose,but from the  main theme I was laughing because it's meant to be such a serious experience-but isn't!I think that only the biggest goldsmith efficianado could find joy in this cd.(.
Used this for Double stroller while on vacation in Hershey Park -fantastic!  Easy to put on - easy to store!  I don't know why strollers - especially doubles - have such dinky canopies anyway!   But this did it's duty
I can't decide whether I bought this notebook despite the hype or because of it. But I do know that when I have a Moleskine notebook with me, I actually write. That is reason enough for me to be a loyal customer. No more journals started, then abandoned, and no more ideas forgotten because I didn't write them down right away. --- I suspect that it really is despite the hype that I love it. Here's why: --- * As I said, I actually use it. --- * Delightfully smooth paper. --- * Nice thin lines. --- * A variety of styles. --- * Pocket in back keeps little things; in my case, it's often fortune cookie fortunes. --- * Elastic keeps the paper clean. --- * Holds up well in my pocket or bag. --- * Did I mention the delightfully smooth paper, with the nice thin lines? --- This is the first notebook that I've really been able to carry with me, and that makes all the difference as far as writing is concerned
Very  Satisfied easy to load and very easy to use.I started using it as soon as I loaded it with out reading the help or tutorial. I really like the ease of use and the quality of the invoices it produced. I had Quick books a few years ago and the new one is much more user friendly. I highly recomend this program for anyone running a small Business
Having recently graduated with a BA in English, I am forever doomed to read such so-called "truth texts" with what could only be called an eye for detail; does the author site her sources?  Credentials?  Any sort of solid evidence as to why I, as her reader, should believe a word of what she says? --- The answer is, simply, no. --- Ms. Cumbey quotes other texts by other zealotous fundamentalists, to be sure.  However, the credentials of these people remain a mystery.  Anyone can write a book, and anyone with enough money can get it published.  Had I the funds, I could write a "revealing, riveting best seller" on the nature of human genomes and cloning and my opinions of the matter; throw in a few quotes by people who may or may not sound like they know what they're talking about, and there you go.  The point is, my knowledge of such topics is sorely limited, as is Ms. Cumbey's research.  Yet somehow a book that would never earn a passing grade in a collegiate literature course for lack of research and depth of understanding is littering our shelves.  Well, I'm baffled
Dwell is a unique (in my opinion) magazine and I like that. Unlike many if not most magazines that revolve around home design, this magazine does so with environmental concerns in mind as well as style.  And as someone who appreciates the less is more mantra, I like the fact that the magazine shows off abodes that are small yet spacious.   Like in the April 2006 issue where Aloft in the Forest, where an urban yet forest feel loft style home on a compact lot are shown.  Using easy and affordable ideas for the interior elements. Yes, the magazine has ads, but to their credit they must screen clients so that what ads are there, fit the style of the magazine.  No fluffy dust catching junk
This book if very well done, it has diagrams that not only are clear but  also easy to follow, the photos are outstading, the selecction of models  are just rigth.   I will recomend it for everyone that is interesting in  Origami and as a good gift for a family
This is the last hair straightener you will every buy. Heats up quickly and straightens long, thick and even curly hair in minutes. Haven't stopped receiving compliments since I started using it.
I was a bit weary at trying a Shampoo Bar, but as soon as I took a whiff of this little hockey-puck of sunshine, I was sold.  The scent is strong - so watch out if strong florals give you headaches - so strong, in fact, I can smell the jasmine and honeysuckle wafting out of the shower at this very moment.  When I had it in the bag, fresh from purchase, it scented the entire living room!  The conditioning agent isn't enough for people who use deep conditioners -  I recommend following up the shampooing with a seperate conditioner.  But the Fragrance and ease of rubbing a bit of soap onto wet hair, achieving masses of luscious lather, a quick rinse and go - Priceless!  This is definately a little gem that everyone should try
I have very sensitive skin, a thick beard, and must shave daily.  What a hellacious combination! The Art of Shaving for Sensitive Skin is the best shaving cream I have found...and I have been searching far and wide.  As for the rest of their products...eh, I could take them or leave them...i.e. there are similar products you can acquire much cheaper. --- This shaving cream in particular has no alcohol and all kinds of natural ingredients including a bunch of non-comudegenic (sp?) oils that really protect your skin. 
The advertising of this product on your site is kind of deceiving, because it doesn't properly show it. From what I saw on the Amazon site, I thought the wallet will be much bigger.  Amazon doesn't give measurements of the product, and there are not enough pictures of the it. Basicly it isn't worth it to buy a product if I'm not sure of how it looks like.  Now I have a wallet that my husband does not want, and I can do nothing with it.  I feel that I wasted $25.00
It looks cool and it's easy to carry, but that is about it.  Camera is slow and pictures are often blurry.  Sorry I wasted my money on this one.  Get one of the new ones with VR so you don't have that issue. 
Although this is one item that you never want to have to actually use, I did try it on an old piece of safety glass and it worked beautifully.  I will keep this in my car at all times, and will order the key chain hammer as well for myself and my family members
I purchased this phone to replace my land line and have not been disappointed. I haven't used all the functions yet (downloading music), but haven't had any problems with anything else. Here are some pros and cons: ---  --- Pros --- 1-Colorful/Clear Display --- 2-Good Volume (ringer volume is loud enough and I can hear callers just fine) --- 3-Easy Menu Navigation ---  --- Cons --- 1-No shortcut to get to main menu (have to keep pressing "back" button) --- 2-Battery access (it's really hard to take the casing off to get to the battery and SIM card-could be a good thing though) --- 3-On/Off Button (it's very small-basically have to use my fingernail) --- 
I am a no coffee, drink tea ALL the time person.  I have tried so many teas and am constantly interested in trying new ones.  This has to be the most wonderful green tea out there!!  It is wonderful!!! 
I have all the "Grand Theft" games and this is one of my favs.I highly recommend it and all the others.I recently purchased "Liberty City" Awesome
I just love lynch mixed with dooms production. It is what real is
After reading the review from Max I just had to let others know this product realy does work great. It also saves me time. Max's problem may be his whole process is flawed I never read the directions that may be how the product tells you to do it, however all I do is simple. ---  --- Wet the car (in my case truck) down with the regular water then wash the car,truck from the top down I use a microfiber towel and have the towel in one hand and the MrClean autowash in the other. I wash with soap and rinse as I go around the car,truck. --- When it is all washed down re-rinse with regular water from the top down, change to the filtered water and rinse again from the top down. I do this part rather quickley it sprays just like a spray paint gun. then just let it sit and dry. ---  --- The reason I only give the product 4 stars is. The seal cap on the soap compartment leakes in storage if you dont prop it up just right or lay it on its side. And they really needed a trigger for the water controll, on and off. ---  --- I had used this all last summer im sure I washed my truck at least 20 times. and my water filter still worked fine. It may be my process and how fast I get around the truck or I may have cleaner water then what they say as only 10 washes per filter. I am back here to get a new one, beacuse I had kept it outside and well I cant expect it to hold up to a hard freeze can I? heh
I've owned my Diaper Dekor Plus for just under 2 years.  At first, I thought it worked fine.  It was easy to deal with, and easy to empty.  The first liner that it came with lasted me 6 months (1 baby - using newborn diapers through size 2's). ---  --- However, the unit failed to control odors after about 9 months.  Since then I've had to hide it in various places of my home to keep the odor to a minimum.  Definitely not convenient. ---  --- The unit has one particularly fundamental flaw regarding odor control.  Unlike the Diaper Champ which allows you to deposit a diaper without opening the container and letting odors escape, Diaper Dekor has no such provision.  It has two "trap doors" that allow you to drop the diaper in easily, and then they are supposed to spring back into place.  Still, no matter how quickly you drop that diaper in, and let the top lid fall closed, strong odors inevitably escape.  Also, these "trap doors" are quite flimsy.  The hinge on one of them recently broke so that the door no longer springs back into its closed position, thereby contributing to the odor problem.  I inquired about a replacement from Regal Lager and they said I could purchase one for $10.  Instead I decided to purchase a new Diaper Champ, since I've pretty much had it with this thing. ---  --- Speaking of flimsy, there are two other flaws I've experienced.  Firstly, the plastic foot pedal has cracked and seems loose.  It still works, but I have to wonder for how much longer. ---  --- Also, the door on the bottom of the unit that enables you to cut off the bag and remove it does not close very tightly, once again contributing to a lack of odor control.  The door is only held shut by a small plastic latch, leaving a significant gap for odors to escape. ---  --- Overall, I have not been impressed with Diaper Dekor Plus.  However, contrary to what some people say regarding the liner refills, that actually was never one of my bigger complaints.  I did not find them cost-prohibitive at all, because you get 3 liners for $20 and I found that 3 liners will last me about 6 months of holding toddler-size diapers.  In the 1 year 9 months that I've owned this system, I've only had to purchase refills twice.  The only thing I didn't like about it was that I did find it inconvenient to have to purchase liners online (couldn't find any local store that carried them) and wait for them to be shipped to me, especially when there is no indication of when you will reach the end of your last liner. ---  --- Diaper Dekor is the only system I have used extensively, and I would not buy it again nor recommend it to anyone.  I'm hoping my Diaper Champ will serve me better
When I ordered this mitt I did not know any thing about this brand or if I would even like it. I found it to be absolutely perfect for my needs.It is thick enough that you will not burn your hands but soft enough that the leather will not scrape your hand with prolong use.It was just what I wanted
1. they leak --- 2. too expensive --- 3. they don't supply enough lids, so you have to buy more containers --- 4. doesn't work well for feedin
I ordered the Corn on the Cobb popcorn since I could not find it in Phoenix anymore.  It tasted just like regular buttered popcorn.  In the past the popcorn literally tasted like Corn on the Cobb.  My family fought over it!  Not anymore!
I wore out my tape of Cypress.  Afoot is great, but Cypress is amazing.  I bought this while stationed in the Army.  There weren't too many "new wave" tapes available at the PX, and I wasn't going to listen to Def Leppard or Bon Jovi.  So I bought Cypress. ---  --- One of those rare tapes that I bought 20 years ago and still listen to every few months (The Jam's Snap and Setting Sons, and The Smith's Hatful of Hollow are 3 other tapes I never tired of).  ---  --- Get this CD.  Get it now!   It is great.   Thanks for reissuing it.
It's a great tool to have at all times.  Security, provacy, and power in one little handy device.  And the U3 apps are multiplying quickly.  Next I want a full-blown system on a flash drive
We have used Kona coffee pods for about a year.  They were excellent.  We found it more convenient to order through Amazon, as the shipment arrived more quickly.  With this last shipment, the coffee often was watery even though the coffee unit was functioning well.  It was hard to know what to do with these various boxes of coffee from from a remote supplier
My 4 1/2 year old recieved this red engine last Christmas, and for the first couple of months was used practically every day. (And yes, I agree with the rest of the reviewers- buy rechargable batteries since this engine eats them, and prepare to be disappointed since it cannot pull many cars up the hills without getting stuck.) I will tell you that I cannot BELIEVE my son has not touched this engine since. His complaint is that all it does is go around and around. Instead, he enjoys playing out stories from Thomas, or making up his own train sagas. My husband likes to watch the engine more than my son. I don't know how other children play with their trains, but the battery operated engines just cannot hold his attention for very long. Nevertheless, for the first few months, watching it is really mesmerizing, I could watch it for hours. Perhaps instead of buying this one engine, purchase a setup with more cars and track for the same money. It will probably get more use in the end
We have only had this showerhead for one month.  Already the nozzles are clogging.  The spray has become more like pins and needles than a gentle waterfall.  Do NOT purchase this product if you have hard water
I drive alot commuting to and from my job. This music has served as the perfect backdrop to an lovely Indiana fall! I'm sure I'll recall those colorful images as I continue to listen to this CD through the colorless days of winter
I also bought the hype of NYTimes Best Seller.  Goes to show you some people have really bad taste.  The story was promising and could have been exciting without the awful dialog.  It seems like the author was being paid by the word - too much repetition, entire scenes which added nothing to the story, etc.  I would NEVER purchase another book by this author.  Glad it's over and this ones in the trash can...  Charli
The product was a gift for my mother who needs extra circulation in her feet.  She loves it and it has helped increase the circulation
i like getting good stuf in the mail and one day i received this mag from my grandma and i really enjoyed it, seeing as i had just enter hi skool and there we TONS of things i wasnt real sure on...however my mom discontinued it, saying i was too young for it...many reviewers say this, so i will say what many of them fail to specify: ---  --- This magazine is geared more for girls who have entered the high-school, teenager period, and deals ALOT with makeup and boys, a bit of fashion, and keeping close to your friends. ---  --- i will take a stab at saying its mostly for teens, if not for the younger ones, ages 15 and up...but realy, dating and makeup are things a girls will decide on when shes ready...i have neither dated, nor wore makeup, and im an older girl, and the ONLY reason i am more interested in boys and trying to put on eyeshadow is age-curiousity...the mag has not affected me in any way...except provide a few hours worth of reading and quiz-taking, plus help on everyday worries (ie, body&health, social probs, and so forth) ---  --- great mag if you know you have a mature daughter who doesnt change overnite to please people at skool...age isnt the real big issue ---  --- if u are maturer (15 and up, or have just matured 5x faster than most girls ur age) and want a mag that is more real life than just made up stories (they have a fiction section), more diverse girls (all kinds of body types and ethnicities), and all around more mature theme, pick up Seventeen...its a great mag, but parents beware...is talks about sex and has real life stories that can be very disturbing...just to warn u...my rents didnt realy like it, but if ur well rounded and have good morals, u realy need not worry... ---  --- see y
The lens adaptor threads on very easily and I've not seen any loss in color or light from using this filter
I purchased one and was so pleased that I bought another.  Keeps liquids hot for hours, much better than the Thermos I had.  Wash by hand - do NOT put it in the dishwasher or it will lose its thermal effectiveness (voice of experience)
Well not to bad a deal.Most of the movies here aren't too bad(The Inspector General,A Farewell to Arms,A Star is Born etc;)and have basically clear picture and sound quality.It's true several of these are silent but even a few of those are good.There is a problem with this set however,after you've watched these movies once they will begin to wear out my mother and I discovered this when we wanted to watch "The Flying Deuces" for the second time the film was a lot more blurry and it was difficut to hear some of the dialogue.My advice is not buy this collection unless you find it for sale VERY cheap,and to just rent some of the better ones.We did get a few things out of this my mother said that she discovered Buster Keaton,W.C.Fields and Charlie Chaplin because of this for instance,(and after we liked Father's Litle Dividend we decided to watch Father of the Bride which was even better)so I have decided to give it an extra star just for that
Georges Seurat was totally insane by the age of 32.  Knowing that helps Stephen Sondheim's genius show through. Sunday in the Park with George is an amazing show about the life of this manic artist, and the fictional personalities of the figures in his painting "A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte". The first Act is completely devoted to a set of Sundays spanning 2 years of Seurat's life and the end of his relationship with a long-time lover. The dramatic and touching songs make you feel for this hard-nosed painter yet comical points shine through. The second act takes place 100 years later in 1984 with the Great-grandson of Georges (also played by Mandy Patinkin) doing a tribute to the painting that brought his relative so much posthumous fame. Like other Sondheim shows it is at times long-winded, but altogether entirely enjoyable. Mandy and Mrs. Peters' voice have so much emotion and power that, with the correct sound system, you are carried to the brink of pure delight and insanity by their performances. With Commentary from the actors and producers this is an essential for one who collects musicals
My daughter started with the Baby Bjorn stand alone potty seat - which was great when she was just getting started with the idea of using a potty. She quickly became too tall to use the stand alone potty seat, so I ordered this Baby Bjorn Toilet Trainer and it has been fantastic. She quickly learned how to put the seat on the toilet herself and adjust the wheel to make it snug. It was also easy for her to remove and hang on a small butterfly doorknob my husband attached to the side of the sink cabinet. The seat gave her a great sense of independence and allowed her to be comfortable and secure while learning to use the big potty.  ---  --- It is also great for traveling. I would put it in a zippered canvas tote and carry it with us into rest areas (it really does fit any toilet) - she could sit securely and be protected from unclean surfaces (I would carry a small container of Disinfectant wipes to clean her seat off each time we used it in a public restroom).  ---  --- I highly recommend this Baby Bjorn Toilet Trainer
See title. these shoes are simply the best pair of foot protectors ive ever owned. so comfortable,  waterproof and just sweet-looking. i feel like a ninja every time i wear them
For the price... this cover is great. It's thin, easy to dial through and see through, easy to get it on and off. No complaints. I just wish I had it sooner... before i dropped the phone and cracked the screen. I HAVE dropped it since getting this cover and it was just fine
This dictionary is not for the person who English is his second language. It does not have enough sentence examples to let you know how to use each entry word. In addtion, the micro doesn't work well with MS Word.
On a recommendation from a friend, Heimgest, DCG-OR, (who rarely recommends any book), we found this book to be one of the absolute best on the subject of our Gods & Goddesses. A must read, it ranks well with both Rydberg's and Grimm's Teutonic Mythology
Works real well for leg exercises, but when doing arm exercises it tends to slide downwards
Yum! Fond childhood memories and sweet almost guilty pleasure is created whenever I use this. It smells wonderful. Deliciously scented bubbles blossom on my mesh sponge. This shower gel cleans well without being harsh to sensitive skin. I don't like it as a shampoo as much. When I do use it to wash my hair, I'm sure to follow up with a conditioner. It's a delightful product and I'm pleased with my purchase
Run time was 48 minutes.  A stellar documentary.  The download worked perfectly.  Hope the review was helpful.  ty
I wasn't pleased with this book. I've read all of Ms. Warren's E-Books and I have to say they have a lot more fire. She lost a lot in this book.  Somewhere around the middle of the book, I started thinking "Did I actually buy a book this bad."  --- Because I enjoyed her e books so much I didn't stop to think before purchasing it. I was so happy to have her book, I immediately called a friend who also drove to the book store to purchase the book.  Boy, Did I get it from her the next day.  --- Because we don't believe in throwing money away, We're still stuggling to finish the book. Hopefully, there is light at the end of the tunnel.
The Maestro, the evil future intelligent world conquering version of the Hulk, comes with one arm and arm tube of the mighty Apocalypse.  Apocalypse being the kick butt 14" giant figure you can build if you buy the six figures in this series. ---  --- Maestro Hulk has great paint and body sculpt with tons of detail and his muscles are so huge it looks like his skin may burst.  His beard is scuplted and painted well and he comes with his crazy pointy hat that fits well on his bald head.  He is a touch shorter than I'd like and this plus the swelled size of his arms and hands and his funny clothes do make him look dwarf like but once you get used to it it grows on you.  Overall a really cool figure and someone to take on the first appearance grey Hulk from the Galactus series.  Talk about alpha and omega
I am satisfied with the product.  For that matter I know it before I bought and I am satisfied with it.  The only glitch is it will take some time to start and until it starts we may not be able to browse or use any applications that needs internet.  Still I would suggest it is a best option to buy one for ur computer safety
I have used Olay Regenerist Perfecting Cream for over a year now. It leaves the skin feeling very soft without feeling greasy and seems to smooth out the skin nicely. It does not have spf protection so for daytime I use a lighter moisturizer with spf over it before applying my foundation. At night it's all you need
It's fascinating to compare my own experiences, having lived now 3 years in Germany, to those of an American from 125 years earlier.  I've been learning to speak German, and his Appendix on the "awful" German language was hilarious.  In poking fun at German grammar (e.g., long sentences), he purposely commits the same errors in his own writing.  The scene "riding" the glacier down the Alps was so funny I had tears running down my face.  It's amazing to think that it was written in 1879, when America was barely a century old, and the insights and perceptions then can be incredibly, eerily similar to either my or "typical" American's attitudes today. ---  --- I'd recommend it to anyone, but particularly to anyone visiting or living in Europe.  It's way funnier than his "Innocents Abroad", which is also a good read on travel in Europe
This tea is premium.  Don't accept green tea in bags; it is less tasty and probably less healthy. ---  --- Here are just a few medical conditions in which drinking green tea is reputed to be helpful: ---  --- * cancer --- * rheumatoid arthritis --- * high cholesterol levels --- * cariovascular disease --- * infection --- * impaired immune function ---  * acne, omg. ---  --- And drink four cups a day for the ultimate tea benefits
T3 is worth every penny. It is very easy to handle . My hair is soft and shiny. No more frizz. It cut straightening time to half. No hair pulling and it is lightweight. PLUS 2 YEARS of WARRANTY hellooo!!!  Bye bye Chi
these roller blades are great they weren't to expensive and they are sooo comfortable they are fast and they are great to learn on and now i'm doing 420 to krooked grind to 270 out. I recomened to everybody that they should buy these and you will get total satisfaction the only bad thing about these blades are that they are a little ugly but they still work really well.
I cannot stop listening to the song I Saved The World Today.  The CD is worth the price for this song alone.  The whole CD is great though ... classic Eurythmics that sounds as great today as their earlier work.  Annie Lennox gets all the attention ... and she deserves every bit, but Dave Stewart certainly deserves as much.  They make a great team and this CD should have been given much more attention in the USA.  I hope they don't take so long to do another one
This card was easy to install and works well. I have very little experience even opening a compter box. Making a spot for the connection to come out of the computer case turned out to be the most difficult part.
The shelves are not sturdy and the pockets are very small...don't waste your money, it's not worth it!
I really enjoyed this movie. At first I thought that her two husbands were Vadinho the gambler and drunk, and Vadinho the loving husband.  He was bascially two different people himself.  I would have left him if I was her, though but I understand that in that time women didn't leave their husbands.  Also in that time, it was not uncommon for men to have mistresses.  After Vadinho's death, I was happy that Doña Flor decided to remarry, but I thought that she could've found someone more interesting than Teodoro. He's a nice guy and all, but he's just so boring.  She was used to the wildlife with Vadinho, and it was a shock to her when she married Teodoro.  I think that's why she gave into Vadinho when his soul returned.  And since she was the only one who could see him, there was no harm in having realtions with him once again, and in the future. She was happy with both of them. She was getting the best of both worlds.  I highly recommend this movie to all movie goers
Simple, but does what it's supposed to.  Allows you to connect the audio output of a laptop/PC/iPod, etc., to the audio input on your TV.
For the price this product is great - the bubbles were thick and rich and lasted a long time.  The scent was light and fragrant, not over-powering like some other products.  For those who love their bubble baths - highly recommended
I ordered this to give as a gift. I rec'd the package, opened it up and it was completely the wrong thing. Haribo had mislabled the box and what I rec'd was 5 lbs. of sugar coated gummy apples instead. I was very diappointed although Amazon was very understanding and refunded me the total amount. --- I hesitate to order this item again
Easy to use; and a wicked incentive to lose weight. Have lost 20 kilos in just a few months from walking.
Going to Barsetshire is a delightful book, and a much-needed accompaniment to the Thirkell novels.  Ms. Snowden obviously spent a great deal of time reading the 29 novels in Thirkell's Barsetshire series, and has produced a companion to the series that makes it very easy to keep track of the characters, places, and cultural references, especially for an American who is not well versed in mid-20th Century English esoterica.  I also enjoyed the writing style and the well-chosen quotes.       In addition to the book's comprehensive content is its straightforward layout and user-friendly format. This exemplary reference guide is not a flashy publishing house production, but instead keeps with the simple charm of Barsetshire in its quality and overall appearance. The original cover art, showing an idyllic Barsetshire scene, is lovely.       I heartily recomend the book to all Thirkell fans
I bought this camera in August. It is really well made and the controls are easy to navigate. I think it takes really good pictures, inside and outside. Who cares about video quality? Its a Camera, not a camcorder,lady. I think it is a really nice camera. Its really durable too. And it looks nice. I would buy it again. I researched a bunch of cameras before this one and I chose the Sony in the end. Its one step up from just taking everyday pictures. They look really pro. I'd buy it again
We bought this scratch remover years ago from an auto store. It wasn't that expensive but totally useless. We put it on a scratch or two on our car which is black and did what it said. It did nothing except leave a white stain on the area I applied it to. I tried everything to get it off, then I had to use my last option rubbing compound.  ---  --- Luckily the rubbing compound got the stain off. After this I dumped the tube in our basement and lost track of it since then (Probably dumped it). Shortly after we went to the auto store again and we found auto paint. They come in a little tube with a paint brush and each paint has a code (got to get the one for your model car). Used it worked well and years later still looks good. ---  ---  Up close you can still see a scratch was there but only really up close. After that I waxed the area after the paint dried and it looked fine. Unless you look for it you will not see a scratch. So don't buy this product either buy the auto paint or take your car to an auto body shop. This product would be better as a door stop and even then it would probably do a poor job.
Finally a lemon that can be preserved for future generations to see and behold it's yellow glory. ---  --- Thank you modern science
First of all the colors of the product at amazon pictures and the real product doesen't match. What seens to be a silver watch it is realy a white one. At the beggining everything was ok, at the end of first week the light button locked (after a few hours i get it unlocked), in the second week the the battery has ended. I'm very disappointed..
Everyone loved these pretzels. Very flavorful, not too salty. I plan on buying more from Amazon, best price I've found on this brand
this is a great travel magazine - wonderful pictures and stories.  it is also much cheaper than the equally wonderful travel+leisure, so that makes conde nast traveler a better deal.  be aware though, the items in this magazine are not very cheap, unfortunately.  go with another magazine (arthur frommer's budget travel) if you want to find travel baragains
I know my gummi's and Haribo gummi's are the only ones worth eating! If I can't find this brand at the store, it's nothing. A little tip: I buy the 5lb. bag at Safeway for under $6! (A much better bargain than here.) They are usually located on the bottom shelf underneath the hanging smaller bags
My office has numerous i530 phones that came with our contract.  No person in our office has ever commented on how much they like this phone or its performance.  Battery life is terrible out of the box, the interface is clunky, and our personal phones with half the bulk have at least twice the overall performance.  If everything else in your life is perfect then this phone is for you-- it will give you SOMETHING to complain about.  For the rest of us consider other models or other manufactures to work with your Nextel/Sprint network contract
Zoolook~ Jean-Michel Jarre is a case where the artist is way to avant-garde for his own best. After having made amazing albums such as Oxygene, Equinox and Magnetic Fields he unfortunately creates this mess of an album. I find it a bit too much like modern art, i.e., confusing, confounding and impossible to grasp. It also seems like Jarre was a bit over confident when he recorded this album. He had recorded some of the best synth albums of all time and decided to create a total arts album and it just does not work. This is an album that should have stayed unrealesed since it is just to avant-garde and sounds more like an experimental sound session rather then as a well produced album. Very disapointing indeed!
This is a very nice case. It fits well and even though it is made of plastic it has a textured leather feel to it. I found that i had to file the charging plug as the case impeads the plug from a flush fit. ---  --- A great case that I would highly recommend.  
I'm not one for guns in my household, but my potty-training son really wanted this blaster gun. He's a total Star Wars fan (like his father) and I told him that he could have it if he said good-bye to diapers. He did. So we ordered it and waited for the UPS man to come. He was so excited when it was delivered. He thought the UPS man was so cool for giving that to him! Anyways, there is so much detail on this blaster gun. The sounds are pretty cool and it lights up red. My son loves the sight scope too! Big hit in our household!!!
These batteries work well.  They don't last as long as normal batteries, but the ability to recharge them makes them more than worth the additional costs.  If you have kids with toys, these are a must
I purchased the pink razr with Cingular service and couldn't be happier. I have had it for about a month and have had no problems at all. I am very happy with it. T-mobile is not a very good service in my opinion and that is why I chose Cingular
Great product, the girls had a blast with it.  Real easy to use and real easy to put the gems back in the jeweler once you take them out of your hair.  Great fun for girls who enjoy dressing up and getting bedazzled!  Although it kinds of pulls a piece of hair or two out when you try and slide them out of your hair.  Not all the time though.  Still a fabulous product.  Would highly recommend it.  My niece wishes it came with more gems
Overall a very nice charger, though recharge times aren't even close to what is advertised.  The display is very nice as is the ability to charge individual batteries instead of having to do it in a pair.  The 900 mAH hold such a small charge that they are almost worthless.
I highly recomend Fruit of the Loom mens briefs. Not only I did grow up wearing their brand, but my father and his father before him all wore these briefs. If somethings not broke why fix it
I ordered this magazine for my grandmother, as we are both HUGE Paula fans. We got the first issue and read it front to back several times. It is an awesome publication filled with recipes and pictures and stories about Paula's life. I think it really captures the feeling of Paula Deens show
Audrey, without Givenchy, and only a portion of her face visible, few lines and much conflict gives one of the great performances.  The depth of the movie, the richness, amount to a great piece of art.  Certainly, the movie is not "fun," but it attests to a time when a movie about the struggle with faith could be a blockbuster
my daughter is not even 2 yrs old and she is already having a hard time fitting into the potty -- i think this is the case for other types of potty seats too so i'll be trying the type u attach to the adult seat and see how it goes
Can capture analog video and produce cd-rom's but I expected the ability to produce DVD
So this was my first digital camera, got it last july for my birthday. I go to a lot of concerts, so i needed a camera that could take pictures in not good light and take pics of moving subjects. Well, two days after i got it, i was at a festivale watching my fav band perform and the the screen went white. It would still take pics, only you couldnt see them. After changing the batteries and turnign it off and on, it went back to normal. Alarmed, i called Samsung and they told me the couldnt do anythign until it was white again. It only did it a couple of times after that so i never called again. --- But that was only one thing wrong with it. This is a horrible camera for concerts, the pictures are always blurry. Shoot, even when im at my house the pics still come out blurry sometimes. Tuesday i went to see my fav band again, and the dumb thing goes white. It woudnt stop, no matter how many times i turned it off and on again. Now the flash is broke and i'm ready to throw it against the wall. You can't trust this camera. You never know when it will take good pics or bad pics.I wouldnt even consider buying this camera for a minute!
Was excited about this after reading the reviews, but it is so small and imho did not produce enough moisture in the air to warrant the pricetag.  After buying it and trying it, I went out and bought a larger one.  Barely ever use this
bought this machine, based on the reviews on Amazon. It was okay at first. I workout regularly with tapes, outdoors activities and started using the machine twice a week. By the 3rd week it started to make noises as if the wheel was rubbing against the plastic cover of the chain. We tried to see if we can fix it, but it didn't work. I can't use it anymore, mainly because the wheel is not rotating properly and rubber/plastic is rubbing against each other somewhere. You get what you paid for!!! Now I'm looking to invest in something more sturdy. If you exercise once every month this is the machine for you!
The straightener works ok. It straightens my hair better when it is dry. I have very course hair. I still had to blow dry it to get it to straighten out, and go over it a few times to really make it straight. The remington is to thick, so you can not style the hair at all with it. The worst part about this particular straightener is when I leave it plugged in and have it shut off it keeps making a beeping sound?? I have to unplug it to make it stop. I just bought a chai straightner for about three times the cost of this, it is only 1 inch thick so it styles the hair very nice, but it straightens my hair the same as the remington. I have only had it a few weeks, so I am intrested to see if the chai causes less damage as it claims then other straighteners
The Thule Sidekick was the perfect size - not too big, not too small.  It did not appear clunky-big on top of the car, nor was it too small to fit anything in.  The assembly was a snap (did it with only one person - no problem).  It withstood freeway speeds in Oregon rain without even letting a drop of moisture into the box.  Highly recommended
GREAT COLOR AND VERY WELL MADE. WHILE SMALL FOR A PRIMARY PIERCE IN THE LOBE THEY ARE THE PERFECT SIZE FOR MY SECOND PIERCE. THIS COMPANY ALSO MAKES BEAUTIFUL 1/2" HOOP EARRINGS SET WITH AMETHYST  THAT I'M VERY HAPPY WITH.
I love black bean soup and this is the best mix I have ever bought.  As a previous reviewer stated, vegetables mix very well with this soup. I recently added a drained can of corn to get another serving and it tasted great
This "pillow" is an inflated "U" that fits around your neck. One of the problems is, it has a rather sharp plastic edge around where it touches your neck. This can get pretty irritating the longer you use it. ---  --- Fortunately, it is dirt cheap, so then I guess you get what you pay for. --- 
I bought this watch for work to time a 2 min procedure.  I found the 30 sec sweep hard to get used to.  I'm used to a 60 sec sweep. And the minute hand was difficult to read.  I really had to check to see if I was at 1.5 min or 2.5 min.
I love this pasta so much that I'm constantly paranoid that it's not really low carb.  There is absolutely no taste difference, and it preps exactly the same as regular pasta
truly wonderful!  My 4 year old son hasn't quit playing this game since Christmas
I was a huge fan of the jam , but Ive grown to despise Paul Weller and this CD strengthens my view. This is a covers cd and hasn't got a patch on albums like all mod cons or sound affects.With paul weller everything is about a  quick buck and ripping off a loyal fan base , with over a dozen jam compilations ,rarities, box sets and dvd's in the last few years.[since he bought the exclussive rights to all the jam recordings from the rest of the band].This album is bland  so give it a miss and spend your money on the new stiff little fingers cd which features bruce foxto
I am listening to Badfinger even as I type this review. --- This is the Best Of Badfinger Vol 2, and I thought volume 1 was great !! As previous reviewers have said, what an absolute tragedy the story of Badfinger is (Buy the Book "Without You" the tragic story of Badfinger). --- Well I have everything they have released, if you do buy any of the Badfinger best ofs, you will more than likely get hooked and start collecting all of their albums.Some of the best songs on this Cd are off "Wish You Were Here" their best album by a mile IMHO.In fact 6 of the 9 songs on WYWH are on this compilation. --- They were such an original group with every member capable of writing an exhilirating hit song. just have a taste of "Just A Chance", "You're So Fine", "Meanwhile back At The Ranch/Should I Smoke".They were just so good, Damn I miss them
I wish Targus made the same bag just a few inches wider.  My Toshiba 2600 barely squeezes in the bag.  However, it does fit and I was able to mount it between the two seats of our 2004 Toyota Sienna with no problems.  There's also ample room for cords and DVDs.  ---  --- I like how this bag doubles as a storage case and a way to mount it in the car for viewing.   ---  --- All in all, a very nice product. 
Herb Alpert has done what few artists can do. He's taken his seminal masterwork and transformed it into another entity that is equal to or may even surpass the original. ---  --- I love the original "Whipped Cream", but this CD is a masterstroke. Combining Alpert's traditionally peppy music with downbeat electronica transforms it into a soothing, but never boring mix that continues to enchant the listener from beginning to end. ---  --- Unlike some of the purists, I loved this CD and you will too
Another disappointed customer.  ---  --- I have very thick, coarse, wavy hair and trying to manage it is a nightmare! Before using Fekkai's Luscious Curls lotion, I was using Aveda's Be Curly Lotion and Matrix's Curl.Life contouring creme. Both of the latter products work very well with my hair. I don't like to blow dry my hair (too time-consuming), so I just air dry it. Without blow drying, whether I'm using Aveda or Matrix, the results are great! My hair is smooth, shiny, and less frizzy. ---  --- I had never used Fekkai's products before, but decided to give this one a try. Everything Luscious Curl Enhancing Lotion claimed to do, didn't do for my hair. In fact, it actually made my hair worst! It became stiffer, drier looking, frizzier. In addition, my wavy hair, (usually bouncy and alive), became flat and dull. Also, I didn't like the scent of this particular curling lotion. It was very strong smelling and made me nauseous.   ---  --- Because of my very poor experience with Fekkai's Luscious Curls lotion, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I think I'll stick to the Aveda and Matrix curling lotions, since they are much more compatible with my hair.
I tried reading this book but found it so turgid and poorly written that I put it down in frustration.  It reads like a translation from another language by an academic bureacrat. The theme is interesting, the execution poor.  Cannot recommend
I subscribed to T+L for one year.  My wife and I found the magazine to be uninformative and of little value when planning our travels.  Most of the magazine seems to be centered around places to go shopping and the photos that accompany the articles are artistic photos, usually of models wearing $1,000 outfits, instead of informative photos of the resorts or hotels.  The recommended travel products tend to focus on $1,200 designer duffels which, while perhaps within reach of the target demographic, are unlikely to survive many trips through a major airport. ---  --- In addition, my subscription came with an unrequested automatic renewal.  I didn't enjoy the magazine and nearly every copy was in my recycle bin within 15 minutes of receiving it.  However T+L decided that I would somehow like a renewal although I certainly never requested one.  In my book, those are questionable and perhaps unethical business practices. 
AC/DC is the greatest band EVER!!!!!!!!!!!! this cd has my fav song on it Rock N Roll Damnation I luv both eras, Bon Scott and Brian Johnso
I love the workout dvd that comes with it - but the ball developed a slow leak after only a few uses.  Very disappointed with this product
I've been working with foals for about 18 years.  This book is well written and includes very good illustrations.  It's good for new handlers and experienced handlers (reminders of different options to use with different personalities) as well.  I highly recommend it
I really tried to like the Via Michelin, bought it with every intention of loving it in March 2007.  But I feel compelled to tell most of you to "keep shopping."  I bought it due to the excellent price, small thin size(compared to Garmin). I thought "how bad can it be?"  I ordered it and had it shipped to my door, then took off on a 3400 mile trip with it.  This is because my other GPS units were in other cars, with other family members already on other trips. I bought this one as a budget GPS, optimistic that it was new and had the Sirf-III chip.  But before long, I hated this unit, all the criticms of other reviews came back to haunt me, and I will tell you about it below.   ---  --- First, please note there are a few positive reviews for this unit....but have you noticed they are mostly all people who have no experience with "Other" GPS units? Or they didn't spend much time with it before they reviewed it?  Or they haven't had experience with GPS in 4 years..which is like a century in terms of how fast this technology is changing?  ---  --- For positive reviewers, if this is their first "newer" GPS and if they are comparing it to a Car navigational GPS Of 4 years ago, then yes, it is quite a bit better. But compared to the new units like Mio 310x or the Tom Tom One (both of which I own) then the ViaMichelin has a "horrible" user interface, and is horrible to use on the roads. Tomtom and Mio, often finish what you are typing for you, they are intuitive and programmers have polished them. But the ViaMichelin is very non intuitive, absolutely dangerous to try to use on the fly.  Sure, we are not supposed to use them while we drive, and with this one it is TRULY dangerous even when you learn the complicated system.  So most of the time, you have to pull over and work on it.  But it is no fun, and even you program it, if you go to another screen it "loses" it and you have to program the history all over.  You will soon be frustrated with how many steps this unit takes to do anything, and how "lost" it often gets. I will try to give you the pros: ---  --- Pros:  Small form factor, decent screen, SIRF 3 chip. NAVteq maps. Four hour battery life.  Good price for a Sirf-3 chip unit. ---  --- Cons:  Horrible non intuitive software program, clunky, multi step interface that will make your life horrible if you are in a rush or emergency...or even if you are not in a hurry.  Horrible speaker..volume so poor and speaker so poor, you CAN'T hear it with any road noise present...seriously...turn speaker up all the way while driving..it will crackle and is illegible.  I read this in a review, but honestly didn't believe it until I owned it.  Third, unlike ANY GPS I've had, this one literally tells you to "start driving" before it can tell you which way to go, when you've routed it to the nearest store, etc.  Think about that!  It means sometimes you have a 50% chance of making the right choice as to which way to go...then if you guess wrong, it tells you to turn around and go the other way!  Seriously...that one feature should be enough to make you say "NO" as most GPS will at least tell you to "turn right" from where you are parked or "turn left" but this one will say "start driving" without ANY direction....because it can't seem to route until you drive onto a road.  It can't do it from a parking lot!  It already will have the satellite location...that's not it..it's a software bugaboo I think built into the programming.  It makes you "start driving" because it can't find your location or know which way you are going..until you start and it routes the direction you are traveling.  Bad software design for sure.  When you go to Canada, you have to have installed (on another SD card) the Canadian map....very inconvenient when you cross the border.  Navteq maps could not find many locations on coastal Maine. Literally, we were driving on coastal roads it said did not exist.  I found it VERY slow recalculating trips when you missed a turn (MUCH slower than my  Mio 310 which was purchasd last year, or TOM TOM ONe which was purchased this year) and this recalculation problem in busy city traffic, caused us to miss several critical exits.  Want to find POI's on the run?  Forget it. Too many steps and illogical organization compared to other major brands. It often could not find even local Walmarts...one's that have been there for 20 years.  I'm serious.  I parked in front of Walmarts that it could not find...very old Walmarts.  To be sure, Garmin, TomTom and Mio do not list ALL Walmarts, but at least they get 4 or 5 out of 7 in my home town.  Not so Via.  In several towns in Maine and Connecticut, I parked in front of rows of old stores that had been there for years.  Punch in  local stores on the difficult to use POI list, and it can't find any of them.  Also, punch in or look for stores like nearest Walmart....Mio and Tom Tom had no problems finding several..or the nearest ones it knew about from your location.  But with Via, it has to be within a certain distance from you..or it will not show up as existing.  So....you then have to figure out the next town and search from that location, to try to find the store.  Very, very clunky....can't tell you how much trouble that is.  It's so simple on the other units, you get spoiled with the Garmin or TomToms.  This one makes it so hard and still can't find the POI's.  No GPS finds all stores....there is a limit on POI's, of course.  But it seems the Via programmers spent their time gathering addresses for BANK ATM's and not restaurants, shopping, etc. Believe me, once you've used it on a trip, it's organized to make you believe the programmers never actually used a GPS themselves before. ---  --- I can't say enough about how "difficult" the interface is....and when you go "back" or "forward" to another screen, it often loses where it is...and you have to start all over again programming where you are going, going through multiple difficult steps.  When you lose power, again, you start all over. When I bought it, I read some of the negative and positive reviews and thought....how bad can it be?  I thought the complaining people are probably not techie and are complaining for no reason.  WRONG!  The experienced GPS users are the ones that know just how clunky and bad this software interface is compared to the sleek Garmin or Tom Tom interfaces.  Example: On one trip, my daughter began to throw up, and we had to find an emergency medical treatment facility....this clunky interface made it very difficult to locate one. When you are panicked, you want to quickly find the nearest hospital.  This unit makes you put in the town, etc. if you are further than x miles or so...like when you are on the interstate....so you are literally guessing which town to search to find a hospital.  Which is horrible.  I had this happen before and with the Mio, about 3 clicks and BAM you have searched and found the nearest hospital...one more click and you are routed to the nearest hospital.   ---  --- Truly, I am sad to not recommend the ViaMichelin.  I really recommend you "pass" like some other reviewers have suggested. And I recommend you to buy the more rapid, easy to use Mio with the great screen, blazing fast Sirf 3 and calculating chip, and loud-clear-speaker.  If you are tech challenged, buy the Garmin or TomTom's with their awesome and easy to use software interface.   ---  --- But don't buy this bad speakered, horrible interfaced, poorly designed, buggy unit.  On paper, it looks like a killer unit. But in reality, it is an unpolished clunky paper tiger that is horrible to use.   ---  --- Finally, there is the "fun" factor.  The TomTom One is fun.  The Mio is fast and fun, a pleasure to use!  Even the newer Garmin's are fun with their simplicity (I hated the screen on some of the old Garmins.)  But the ViaMichelin X-930 has no fun programmed in....it is not a pleasure to use, although it will take you across country.  Believe me, the pleasure of the low price will quickly fade once you start working with the unhearable speaker, unpolished, unfun, clunky, interface with poorly organized features and disorganized POI's and menus. The polished quick intuitive menu is where Garmin and TomTom shine.  The only thing better on the ViaMichellin is the screen and Sirf-chip...some of the older Garmin's use an older satellite GPS chip than the ViaMichellin, but new tomtom's and Via use the same GPS satellite chip, but faster software routines and cpu chips.  But even the use of the Sirf-3 chip on the Via Michelin, cannot make up for the poor software and menu design. Theoretically, this thing should be blazing fast, but it is much slower than my TomTom or Mio.  The only thing better on this unit than the Mio, is that the Via is smaller and thinner. And maybe the Navteq maps might be slightly better for some locals.  But other than that, the Mio wins hands down, by far a faster, better and easier to use GPS in my opinion.  If you are looking for software ease, go Garmin first, then Tom-Tom, then Mio, and Via last.  If you are looking for value in a great unit then go with the Mio 310x, it's a killer unit and it's hackable.  But if you are looking for simplicity i programming where you are going, go with Garmin first, then Tom-tom. I tried you Mr. ViaMichelin, but you need to go to "finishing school" like the other GPS students.  You are just too unfinished and rough
I dropped the camera from 2 feet and the metal outer rim of the lens slightly became bent and won't close. After some time spent tring to bend the metal back in place, I finally was able to close the lens.  ---  --- Besides that, it is an awesome camera. I am able to pick out a color (ex. red) and take a picture with that color standing out and everything else black and white. No photoshop needed
Yes, T&C is the oldest continually published magazine in the USA, and it's their 160th anniversary. However, I see little reason to celebrate.  Why? Because I fail to see how it's really improved over the years.  ---  --- Nowadays, this magazine seems to cater far too much to the material lusts of the "nouveau riche". Back in the day when it was a true "high society" magazine, there were rather interesting and educational articles on the arts, literature and culture. It was beautiful and it really gave a person something to aspire to, but now just like so much of the rest of society has mutated into a lot of pretentious materialist wannabees bragging about "bling bling", so has this magazine.   ---  --- There are far too many adverts for so-called "luxury goods" for my tastes, and although they put in a patronizing article about women over age 60 being the new "power" base, they insist on using only THIN 20-something models who probably can't afford the clothes they are modeling! ---  --- Articles wise, they are starting to sound more like Glamour or Cosmo than the erudite publication I used to enjoy buying on the newsstands 20 years ago.  ---  --- Yes, T&C has changed with the times...but these are not good times if that is the case. It's too bad
The novel, A Northern Light, by Jennifer Donnelly, is a very realistic portrayal of the life of a teenage farm girl, bound for a great future.  Jennifer Donnelly relates to Mattie Gokey, the lead character, in a way that they bother grew up in rural side of New York.  Donnelly attended the University of Rochester before she wrote her three novels and one children's book. Her novels include, The Tea Rose, The Winter Rose, A Northern Light, and a children's book, Humble Pie. All of her novels include a very popular romantic theme and her book, A Northern Light, has also been introduced in Europe under the title A Gathering Light. ---  A Northern Light reflects a lot on the issues of wealth, education, love, and murder.  The combination of those themes makes for a novel that anyone is able to read and relate to.  As you read this book, you feel like the main message is the traditional cliché of following your dreams no matter how hard they are to achieve. But as you read further, you realize that it's a lot about hardships, strength and love.  On the first page of the book, Mattie is imagining a perfect day at the Glenmore hotel before she so disappointingly tells herself, "I believe these things. With all my heart.  For I am good at telling myself lies".  From this quote, you can see the type of person Mattie is, and it gives a foreshadowing to the events that would take place throughout the novel.  The events typically consist of let down after let down for Mattie and her hopes for her future.    ---  This book is written from Mattie's point of view which really helps the reader to get to know her better.  It adds a different element to the book that wouldn't be there if it wasn't written from Mattie's point of view.  It lets you get inside Mattie's head and feel the emotions that she's dealing with along with her true thoughts and feeling towards situations.  Mattie is truly troubled girl who works so hard toward what she wants and yet there is always something holding her back. She's stuck in a farming town where education isn't as important as having a prosperous farm and a family. As you read this book, you just want to tell Mattie that she needs to take her own future into consideration and stop worrying long enough to have some faith.  She is a selfless giver who is willing to do anything and everything to keep her family and her farm doing well.  She deals with extreme guilt for wanting to leave her father after her mother died.  She has to learn that the promise that she made to her mother to always take care of her family includes taking care of herself as well.  Royal Loomis enters Mattie's life at a very unconventional time when Mattie's unsure of what she wants to become and she has to chose between his love and the life she's always wanted.  Mattie deals with her teacher, Miss Wilcox, leaving town.  Miss Wilcox was Mattie's role model who was living the life of an independent poet with a car and a royal lifestyle.  The life Mattie wants.     ---  This book is intended for a female audience because it deals with issues that sometime only a girl could understand.  It's a fairly easy read so it is more for adolescents than adults but not for young children.  The issues that it deals with are issues that children may not be able to appreciate as much as teenagers who are about to go to college and leave their families.  A Northern Light is full of valuable lessons, but most of all it's just a good book to get lost in. ---  ---  ---    --- 
I was happy at first when I got this memory card but when my phone crashed the memory card was completely wiped out.  I was ok with the memory card getting wiped out but when I tried re-formatting the card my phone, computer and laptop couldnt even read the card so I ended up throwing it away.  I guess You really get what you pay for
I bought these earrings for my Stepmother in Seattle, so I never actually saw them.  Now she is a refined person with classy taste, so you can't just get her any piece of junk.  She said they were perfect and she loved them. That's a great recommendation!
Good baby monitor overall.  Sound quality is good except we are getting an occasional clicking sound and I can't find where the interference is coming from
Out of all of the early '90s, L.A. gangster flicks, this one probably had the best set of Chicano oldie tracks.  The movie was laced with them, yet none are on the soundtrack.  Kind of a waste. ---  --- Sure, you can get those oldies anywhere.  But it would be nice to have those songs from this movie on one cd.  Again, it was a good sequence they used.   ---  --- Aside from that;  It's okay, I guess, if you're a fan of b-list L.A. Chicano rappers.  But, even if you are, you can get better music from their respective albums.  LSOB's first CD from '91 was tight.  If you have that, then you're really not missing anything by letting the  'Loca' soundtrack pass.   
James Spader was supposed to be in the last season of DINER. That would be my only reason for buying it. He is certainly not in this one! So where is he????!!! --- Are there no Diner videos or DVDs with James Spader?
As expected, the new 7180XL razor delivers a close and comfortable electric shave, even though it runs much slower than earlier models.  The slow speed does make it very quiet and the new cleaning method is very handy.  Just 2 noticable disappointments: ---  --- 1.  The external power supply is a rather combersome change from former Norelco products. ---  --- 2.  The exclusion of a storage case is certainly an unwelcome "feature" of an otherwise good product at a premium price
If you're in search of a magazine for women that actually has worthwhile content then move on. There is nothing of substance in Cosmopolitan. Open the latest issue and you will find "sex tips that will drive your man crazy!!!" and "snag that cutie!!" galore. It's pathetic. And sophomoric.  --- The sad thing is young women purchase magazines like this and want to emulate the fake lifestyles within that revolve around a) Looking for your "one true love" and by default B) How to achieve multiple orgasms with random sexual partners/boyfriends whilst on said search! And let's not forget inane question and answer spreads. Those are a hoot with such inquires as "my crack gets really itchy. What should I do?"  --- No, this magazine is not my bible.  --- This is another publication that deserves to be thrown into a furnace
There is no excuse for Norton not advising of the incompatibility of this antivirus software with popular firewalls such as ZoneAlarm before installing the software, especially since previous versions have been compatible.  Once opened, returning the product can be a problem, perhaps that it what Norton is counting on
  A MAGICAL  , SURREAL  JOURNEY INTO " THE MYSTICAL  THIRD  REICH  "  HITLER'S  DREAMS  AND HIS HOPES  FOR A  " GREATER GERMANIA "   YOU'LL LOVE THIS MOVIE !!!  ONE OF THE BEST WWII MOVIES SINCE... " NIGHT OF THE GENERALS " .
Never received product. Ordered 6 of the flashlights on Dec. 3 for Christmas presents. E-mailed seller several times to find out where order was, they never answered my e-mails. --- Good way to do business!
This did not work for us at all.  I found that I couldn't get it wrapped around our newborn without her kicking it off.  If you know how to swaddle then use the hospital blanket or another thin blanket made of cotton
Why do I get the feeling that some of these later reviews were written by Kensington people? The fact is, this light has some unique features that most USB lights don't, including an On/Off switch and two brightness levels. However, that doesn't come close to overcoming the drawbacks.  First of all, the price is way too high for what you are getting. Also, the brightness difference between four and eight LEDs is negligible. But the biggest flaw in this light, by far, is that the flexible arm is not NEARLY strong enough to support the weight of the lamp. I have had to resort to clamping the arm to the side of my monitor, which is just plain ridiculous. For the price they are getting, they should have produced a more durable product
TOO LONG FOR 5" TALL PERSON. I HAD TO MODIFY IT FOR MY WIFE. ITS THE SAME IDENTICAL CHAIR AS AB LOUNGER,ABLONGE CAIR ETC... SAME MANUFACTURERE. IT HAS A STICKER ON IT THAT SAYS "WATCH FINGERS WHILE FOLDING YOUR AB LONGE 2" ON IT. SAME COMPANY,SAME CHAIR. EASY TO MODIFY 'DRILL OR SAW' EITHER WAY TO FIT SHORT PEOPLE.  ---  GREAT PRODUCT WIFE LOVES IT. OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS BUYING THEM NOW. ---  4 STARS NOT 5 DUE TO ME NEEDING TO MIDIFYING IT. BUY THIS ONE SAVE MONEY INSTEAD OF ABLOUNGE. 
After the incredible "Monkey Island" series was halted, I feared that I would never find another series of games that had such imaginative storylines, entertaining dialogue, and lush scenery. Then "Bully" came along, and I was hooked. This really is a great game, and you shouldn't be set against it because it's really nothing at all like Grand Theft Auto. There's no blood, no sexuality (except for kissing), and there's so many involving and engrossing storylines. The characters are also some of the best I've ever seen, each having their own stories and personality. The whole clique thing also reminds you of your days in high school. GET BULLY-- IT'S AN AWESOME GAME. People who like this game should also look at the "Monkey Island" series of games for PC and PS2, and the "Nancy Drew" series for PC
I had thought this would be full of dried fruits and nuts ( in other words, healthful) but it's really just sugar laddened bits of hard fruits and only flavorless peanut pieces.  I have given the local food bank all but the one package I opened which made me feel so unwell that it's now in the rubbish.  I am truly very disappointed in this product.  It's description belies it's reality.  If sugar is contraindicated in your diet....steer clear of this product!!  It's low in salt and low in fat but so over sugared as to be actually nauseating.  It's too bad because it sounded delicious and so nutritious.  All I can say is YUK!!!  I suggest you leave this product alone unless you think high sugar is good for you
"The Player" provided a trip back in time to what it was like playing ball around the turn of the century through the times of the first World War.   ---  --- To understand what Mathewson meant to the game itself is truly amazing.  Not only being a phonomenal pitcher with exceptional control, he realized that he was a role model for others, not only the young kids that idolized him, but the everyday american worker.  To know what he gave of himself to others off the ball field, his charity work, volunteering for WWI at the age of 37, gives us a better insight to the individual. ---  --- The book also tells of his attempts to clean up the game, before the Black Sox scandal.  He knew it was going on, tried to warn others, but no one would listen.   ---  --- A great read if you want to get a much clearer insight into one of the greatest ball players of all time.  One that is unfortunatelly forgotten by too many in today's game
After receiving, putting together and using this toy with myself and children, I overestimated what it would be.  I remember the old school Rock 'em Sock 'em Robots, and this product isn't even close.  The old characters stood 6-8" tall and both necks sprung up with metal parts when a blow to the head was delivered.  This version has only plastic parts, the characters are 4" tall at best, and the 'win' is from a blow to the chest, not the head.  Metallo's head springs up, but Superman's head only nods backward.  It is difficult to discern the 'winner' from the set up.  It was only an $11 lesson for me to learn, but if you truly want a real Rock 'em set, try eBay, or yard sales.  This replica is not comparable to the original
This has been my everyday scent for the last six years. The predominent note is a sparkling anise, an anise that affects a cold, even metallic, chemic artifice. Swirling about this shivery base note are hints of moss, violet, and vanilla-like tonka, lending an aura of both forest and fantasy.  ---  --- Though this is a relatively popular scent, Lolita eschews convention. There are no white flowers, no rose, no peach, none of the banal and cloying sweetness that plagues so many scents. This perfume is instead sensual yet apart, not at all come-hither but insinuating and dark as a Grimm's tale. The tonka is sweet and powdery, gently seductive, while the more prominent anise intoxicates. ---  --- The bottle is stunning; I never throw out a spent one.  --- 
worth the money but dont think it is a feel good happy movie --- its about LIFE
Plenty of room for our HPA612 printer and a friend bought the same one for her HPA617.  Pockets for extra paper.  Shoulder strap for even more ease in transporting the printer. 
I received these earrings as a Christmas gift from my sister.  They are perfect.  Their size is about the circumference of a dime.  Platinum adds elegance and yet, they are perfect for simple everyday wear.  You know they will never tarnish nor will they irritate your ears.  They are also perfect for young lady's first introduction to platinum jewelry. 
Havent really used it but attempted to as soon as i recieved it. Not too sure how it works...its not showing my phone on any of the software programs (after i hook it up using the USB cable)
I was using other internet security programs in the past. All had their pros and cons. I decided to switch to PC-Cillin 2006 Home Security Pack and it is the best available!.  It has both virus and spyware protections built in. The scanning is quick and the updates are easy to get. Plus this home security 3 pack is able to be installed on 3 computers, a bargain. All in all I am sold on this easy to use and comprehensive software product. I highly recommend this product to all! Amazon.com as usual had the best price
I bought the whole superyard play yard kit and absolutely loved it. The extra extensions you can buy for it are great. I have it set up in a living room to keep my son from getting near my entertainment center and leaving my living room. I found it to be very durable and sturdy. When my son was younger it worked great as a place for him to play in. As he got a little older and became more mobile I set the play yard up in my living room to keep him from getting close to my television set. You can bend the pieces to form almost any design you choose. I would say that if you child is getting close to 3 years old not to buy this though. It's sturdy but probably not for that age. It can also be used as a place to put your pet in and can be used outside. I'd recommend this highly
holy jesus this gun is to over priced and is to powerful to be a air soft gun i meen dam its just not righ
This is a great moisturizer for my hair and scalp.  Very light and smells great
I've been using Touche Eclat ever since it came out. I still love it. Cannot believe how rested I look after I put this on. My dark circles are minimized & I look radiant. Till now, no other concealer can beat YSL's Touche Eclat. Can't live without this product!
One of the greatest rap albums of all time.  Wicked backgrounds and rhyming
The mid-size is actually quite large.  Had I to do it over again, I would just get the original size because that would be sufficient.  I like a bit of sun but just not in my eyes!  I found that when wearing it in a boat with the wind at my face as we traveled, it stayed on very well.  That was a concern that I had since many visors flip off in heavy wind currents.  I did get a slight headache from it but not as bad as other visors.  The visor part seems to be a hard plastic with a light cloth material covering.  I chose purple and it is a beautiful shade.  The bows that go around your head are made of some soft comfortable material and they go farther around your head than other standard visors. 
Sorry...no offense intended, but the "Kid's Review" is, well... ---  --- Having used this paper for years I can attest to its superb quality.  Dollar for dollar, this is probably the best value out there!  Virtually NO print-through: perfect for double-sided pages (I even print my desktop-published textbooks on it!).  For the price you simply cannot go wrong with this stock. --- 
My twin sister bought these for me, and initially I thought they were too tall and they would never be comfortable.  ---  --- Breaking them in wasn't so hard - although the little 'ball' part made the top of my foot hurt at first.  ---  --- But now, they feel stable, comfortable and easy to walk it. They feel perfectly balanced and I've never experiance blisters in these shoes.  ---  --- Two thumbs up
I have two double strollers, 1 front and back Graco and this side by side Aria.  I don't use the front/back Graco much do to not being able to have both children sleeping at the same time (2 1/2 year and 1 year.  I had the Peg MT single first and loved it.  So thought the product quality would be the same.  Used it for 2 years with no problems.  But have to say stay clear of the aria design.  Our side by side had numerous pieces fall off, cup holder, seat clip, logo tag, clip to hold trays in place, etc.  Its not durable at all!  We even have to close it using a pen on one side due to the clip you lift on the left side falling off too!  We took it on a plane trip last week and have sworn the whole stroller off.   My sister in law had the single and was having the same problems with the product.  She has since bought the Maclaren single and I am in the process of purchasing the Maclaren Twin Techno.  It may cost more but it would have been alot cheeper buying it first than second
Received the product on time and its working fine. but its a bit harsh on the ears
I'm afraid I disagree with the other two reviews.  I thought this pasta was extremely bland and not very close to what wheat pasta tastes like.  It does take longer to cook and you have to add oil to the water and stir it quite frequently or it clumps and sticks together terribly.  It's an OK substitute but there are much better gluten-free pastas out there.  Although the Glutino is cheaper, I personally like Orgran pasta 100 times better
I am a big fan of Coffee.  Other than water it's all I drink.  ---  --- So when I found this I had to run with it. It's cheaper than red Bull, has more power than it. It's better for you than red bull, and it has a nice flavor that does not leave an aftertaste. ---  --- My frig is stocked with as I type!
No way should children be playing this game.  It is for mature players as the subject matter could confuse younger players.  The goals of harming people, picking up hookers, breaking the law, can be a blast as long as everyone knows it's just a fantasy.  Many people go into the details so I'll make this short.  Have a good time while pretending to be a bad guy who does unforgivable acts.  But there's no way I would consider this game for anyone under 15, and then I would have to know that the teen can handle the fantasy. 
Like Callanetics, this DVD concentrates on the slow movements--you really MUST tuck, you really MUST curl up, or else this DVD is ineffective.  Unless you can shut off the phone and close the door on the kids, the amount of concentration this DVD takes for getting one's posture absolutely correct, tucking just right, is not feasible. ---  --- The workout is indeed effective, and the shortness of it does tend to make one say, "that was too brief to do anything!"  Surprisingly, it's not.  However, if it is not challenging enough, if you add the bonus blast AFTER doing the Lotte Berk workout, you really do see results in a short amount of time.    ---  --- It is worth it for the price, but if you really want an all over workout for the cost of two Lotte Berk DVD's, check out Callanetics
The performance given by Poitier will not dissappoint. This movie version of the play is done from the view point of the son as oppossed to the view point of the mother, Lena. This work is timeless
Beyond the glaring fact that most of their products aren't tomatoes, this one is a blight on the Just Tomatoes ethos. ---  --- "Just." But it has two ingredients. It's not "just" anything if it includes both bananas & strawberries. They don't call Cracker Jack "Just Peanuts, Popcorn, and High Fructose Corn Syrup." ---  --- Nor is it "just" something when it comes in a package of 2. They don't call a variety pack of cereal "Just Grains and High Fructose Corn Syrup." ---  --- The Just Tomatoes folks deserve credit for their aspirations to purity but this just goes beyond it. It goes against the mimalist and reductive concept to the absolutely roccoco. It's just not right
These are by far my favourite yoga pants. Very flattering for practically every sort of figure--but more than that they're SUPER comfy. So stretchy that they feel like a second skin. And the foldover waist is very flattering with just a hint of support if you're self-conscious about your belly. Plus you can unfold it during your practice if you feel your T-shirt riding up. And sheer enough so you can slip a skirt over them after yoga class and you're good to go back on the street! --- The biggest problem with these pants is that it's hard to want to wear anything else. I own some 4 pairs of these and LOVE them
We had troubles fromt he start, they correct a type would not work.  Took to a Brothers repair shop and they could not fix, need some parts.. plus when you tried to type letters you would get numbers...  It was the present my daughter wanted the most for christmas and she could not use... very sad.  So I will by another brand at a local store in town.
First off, I'm a huge geek.  I love programming and computers and the internet.  You'd think Wired would be like some great magazine for me.  But the whole thing is just so whiney and worried about all this "bad" stuff in the world, it makes you sick.  For every cool article about Japanese robots, you have to wade through like 10 articles about "how America is doomed".  Whatever...  they need to man up
This was a very nice item.  I bought it for my mom for christmas.  She loved it.  It was shipped very fast and I was informed very well on shipment information.  This shoe was a great deal.  Usually they are pretty expensive but they had a great deal.  Thanks!
My niece and I love the movie. We sing Thumbelina all the time.  The movie is a treasure. ---  --- I just wish it had some special features worthy of the movie
I first purchased this book when I was a freshman in college seven years ago. It is without a doubt the best and easiest reference guide to writing I have ever read.  I love the plastic tabs that mark each section.  This guide is easy to read and follow it is organized in basic steps that are categorized accourding to section.  So for example if you need to find out how to cite a web page or a video tape, etc using the MLA style you just flip to the section called doucmentation clearly marked with a plastic tab.  I have since purchased an updated guide for myself and also bought one for my brother - a freshman in college.  I really wish I had this book when I was in high school.  I highly recommend this book to any high school, college, graduate student or writer.  I especially recomend this book for students with learning disabilities, I myself have ADD and before I got this guide I could not understand how to write a paper in the MLA style or in any style other than a book report.  I promise this is the easiest reference guide to writing ever published
Though I was daunted a little by the reviews stating problem with installing the game I went for it and I don't regret. I bought the Platinum Edition and it installs all right. The good thing about the platinum edition is that you get three games at the same time.  ---        Would not say it's one of the very bests available in its category but it's interesting and fun. About graphics, though the details are not great, still I liked the 3-D view, specially the view through the eyes of the main character(Hero). ---        Story is so so. Dialogs are specially bad. But the fact that you have to follow certain clues and talk to people and find out useful information is good idea. A sort of combination of RPG and RTS. ---              I like the units and the way they fight. Also picking up artifacts or weapons is good.  ---         Overall it's a nice game. And the platinum edition is specially good as you get lots of hours of gameplay
I just ordered this basket and it came in a totally different color.  Instead of the purple/blue it is a light aqua/blue color.  The basket is still cute...it just doesn't match my daughters bike as well as the other color would have.  I am sure she will love it just as much!  I just wanted to give everyone the heads up! 
to Rice Krispies.  ---  --- Love the whole grain rice - it's crisy and it crackles and my gluten sensitive son loves it
I really love this watch. It looks so nice and elegant. Shipping is supper fast: only 2 days! Great deal. Many thanks
I purchased the non-premium kit ($9.99) with a Silicone skin case cover and 2 screen protectors (one for each screen), but it is the same case.  The problem is that the silicone skin cover is slippery, twice as slippery as the Nintendo Lite without the cover. We thought that washing them in Dove dish soap would wash away the slipperyness, but that didn't work. After handling the cover, your hands have a slippery residue on them.  The other issue is that the cover is so thin that it is little more than scratch protection, not impact protection.  The screen covers that come with the non-premium kit are ok, I guess, but one of them had 2 defect particles that were raised (trust me, the screen was clean).   ---  --- I purchased 2 kits, and I had one screen protector defect and my wife accidentally broke one of the silicone covers hinge straps with little effort.  I do not recommend this product at all
This smells so wonderful! Wear it and you will get compliments. It seems like it might be a summertime-only scent (i.e. very tropical), but I'd wear it year round. I only wish they made a larger size in the oil..
This is a veary FUN baseball game, I first played it at my summer camp and it was so fun, I got it for Myself!!!!!
I've had this dryer for almost a year now, and like the styists who also own it, I find it temperamental. It does a great job while it's working, but the thermostat gets progressively buggier after about three months. If you turn the dryer off, you'll have to wait for it to cool completely before it will turn back on. Now, it turns off while I'm in the middle of doing my hair. The stylists have three or four of these so they can alternate working with one while the other(s) cool off - as I said, when they work, they're terrific. I'm going to replace mine with another brand
This camera delivers excellent video quality. ---  --- I use it with the hot-shoe attachable microphone and the audio is quite good. ---  --- I've plugged this into my HD television and the quality is excellent.  I have also had the Optura Xi from Canon and while the build quality of the HV20 is not quite as good as that of the Optura Xi, the video quality is nothing short of stunning. ---  --- This is a very good deal for $1000.  You won't be disappointed
I carry a lot of tension in my neck and upper back, and as a result get a lot of headaches.  I have been using the Real-Ease for about two months, and have found it very effective at releasing the tension in my neck and upper back and alleviating my headaches.  I have not used it as a preventative - only when I already have a headache.  If something happened to the one I have, I would definitely buy another
This large version of Michael Myers is a lot beter than the McFarlane version released ever how many years ago. First the pose is better.Second NO BLOOD STAINS! Don't get me wrong, Michael Myers is a movie killer, but he never got bloody! That was my biggest complaint with the McFarlane version. He does have slight oily looking stains on his coveralls, but if you remember from the movie, he killed a mechanic to get those coveralls. Finally third, and pretty cool, the sound effect is diffrent. Instead of Laurie Strode's whiny help me , you get the Halloween theme playing along with Michael's breathing. Remeber the end of the first movie, after Loomis shot him, but the body was missing, the closing shots were shown with the theme music accompanied by Myers' breathing. If you got the NECA boxed set of Michael Myers and Loomis and liked it, get this! If you got the Mcfarlane version, get this! If you just like Halloween, get this! You won't be disappointed! Looks better in person than on the picture
 This is a great movie full of adventure and excitement.  Pokemon 4 ever takes place  during the period of the time when Ash is in the Juto League.  In pokemon forever ash   must protect the beautiful pokemon celbi from the evil Iron Masked Marador of team rocket. ---  --- In this movie you get to she something you never got to  she before  Professor Oak as a little boy.  If you are 7 or older than this movie is fine for you.  If you are under 7   this movie may be to intense and violent for you to handle. ---  --- My favorite part in this movie is when Celebi  makes the twig monsters  and start destroying the forrest.  Attribute to toho who created Godzilla.  If you enjoy this you the other pokemon movies.  I also recomend Digmon the Movie.   ---  --- This movie also features a short chute little min movie called Pikchu's Pekaboo which should be fine for  kids age 7 an up
I loved the idea of the electric heating. The "ease" of temperature control, etc... but the heating element melted. The plastic part of it did anyway... right where it conects to the metal bent "rod" that creates the heat to burn the wood chips. ---  --- It also was a pain to constantly snug the wood chips (even tried the chunk type woods) against the heating element. Which ment I had to balance the housing, the water bowl, etc. just to get where the heating element was at. ---  --- I don't know about other electric smokers, but this on "stank". ---  --- Just get one with a smoker box on the side... toss in some coals, wood... whatever... as needed. Don't try to make the unit too "scientific"
I received the earmuffs I ordered 3 days after I placed the order
When I discovered the existence of this novel, I was enthusiastic and intrigued. Unfortunately, my hopes were more or less dashed as I trundled my way through the 382 pages. KLEOPATRA focuses on the famous queen's early years - a period of time of which we have no record - and the intrigues that haunted and led to the demise of any semblance of a family (something she may have compensated for in adulthood). What I liked: 1). The spelling of Kleopatra/ Cleopatra with a "K"- it really does emphasize that Hellenistic connection; 2) Kleopatra's strength of character- Essex's general characterization is appropriate and it's easy to see what Kleopatra will become.  --- Although the novel is a noble attempt by Karen Essex, it just didn't work for me. The character of Berenike as an Amazon seemed a bit far-fetched. And although I loved Kleopatra's love interest (I won't give away his name!), I felt it was a bit far-fetched as well, almost as if Essex was pressured into a love story from the publisher or something. Kleopatra's Dionysian rites were also a little hard to believe, as was Mohama. There were also scenes of random sex that were a bit... unnecessary. Overall, although Kleopatra was a strong, believable character, she was in the minority. The novel as a sort of back-story to the Queen of Egypt didn't work as it was weighed down by the elements of fiction! At least the sequel is better. For fiction that works, check out The Memoirs of Cleopatra by Margaret George.
"Monkey Business" looks pretty good on DVD 50 years later.  The restoration comparison on the DVD shows the change the restoration brought, a bit darkly tinted, and more defined.  The wild plot keeps you glued to the screen throughout.  Marilyn Monroe who is the star on the DVD box has more of a supporting role here.  She is great as the secretary Lois Laurel who shows up early because the boss doesn't like her punctuation.  Cary Grant as the addled Professor Barnaby Fulton turns in a great journeyman performance, getting appropriately loony when experiencing the euphoria of youth.  His driving sequence with Monroe had me turning in my chair with laughter to avoid the trucks!  Ginger Rogers as wife Edwina gets pretty wacky when returned to youth.  If all youth were as lighthearted as these comedic versions, it'd be a laugh and guffaw every time the school bell rings.  Hugh Marlowe as the straight-laced attorney Hank Entwhistle does a nice job of standing stoic during the crazy Indian game.  Oscar winner Charles Coburn (1943, The More the Merrier) does a great job of appreciating Monroe's assets as Oliver Oxly, the CEO.  Kathleen Freeman as Mrs. Brannigan gives a fine performance. The DVD offers perviews of many Monroe films.  This is a great little piece of cinematic history.  Turn back the clock & enjoy
I think this product is fantastic, the adjustable volume works well and the sounds are very soothing. The timer is also a nice feature. This is a great present for anyone in your life that is having a baby. The sheep is cute and  surprisingly cuddly in spite of the digital box in it's tummy.
This is really too small for me to use everyday but is great for times when I want something dressy.   It is a very pretty little bag.  
I HAVE YET TO RECEIVE EVEN ONE ISSUE. I LOOKED ON THE IN TOUCH MAGAZINE SIGHT AND IT SAID THAT I HAVE ALREADY RECEIVED 6 ISSUES. I WILL NEVER ORDER A MAGAZINE SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH THIS COMPANY OR THROUGH AMAZON AGAIN
Unless you have an older/inexpensive bathtub, this won't work. The side pad won't open wide enough to fit on a thicker rim and the seat won't go deep enough. Too bad. It looked great!
This movie helps brings to life what you have read in the Bible about John and future world events. You must see this movie
My son received this as a christmas gift and loves it. Took a little bit for him to understand how to work it. Only down fall is that it won't run on carpet. Requires hard floor or table to sit on. --- Goes really fast
This is a camcorder for the digital age. Tiny, multi-functional, and flexible. No ancient-technology magnetic tape. As with any product on the leading edge, there are many shortcomings. ---  --- Let's dispense with the obvious. This device is all about compact go-anywhere flexibility and ease. For best image quality, a dedicated mini-DV camcorder and dedicated digital still camera is the only way to go. In fact, buying a separate camcorder and still camera may likely be less expensive than the Sanyo C6 while resulting in superior quality. ---  --- Overall image quality is best described as "OK". The poor lens zoom and aperture is more befitting a $100 digital camera than a $400 device. The flash is weak and will not light many scenes that any other still camera would light. In addition, since the flash is not offset in any way from the lens, red-eye is virtually guaranteed at any range. This is not a problem with digital touch-up being common practice, but plan on touching up more often. Low light conditions drag down image quality dramatically in video mode. Virtually any digital camcorder at any price will outperform this Sanyo in video mode in any situation, but a little day light goes a long way towards improving video quality with the Xacti C6. Also, to be clear, the video quality is still superior to anything seen in the best of analog camcorders. ---  --- For all these negatives, the convenience can be truly revolutionary. One can wear the tiny VPC-C6 around the neck all day. This causes an amazing change in attitude towards video. Since the Sanyo is so compact, no one would think twice about bringing it along on any minor travel. Being freed from the chore of "packing up" a camcorder  means a corresponding willingness to bring the Sanyo on so many more occasions, such as a visit to the park instead of just weddings and birthday parties. And whereas a mini-DV camcorder requires one hour to transfer one hour's worth of video to your computer, the Sanyo transfers video as fast as the SD card and USB 2.0 interface will allow. That means five minutes or less to transfer one hour's worth of video to a computer. This ease increases willingess to create video and share video. No more procrastination over dragging out the camcorder wiring and the manual task of initiating video transfer to a computer. With the Sanyo, just place the camera in the docking station and pictures and video files are available just like files on a USB flash drive. It is difficult to overestate the significance of this convenience. Video becomes an everyday pleasure, if one so wishes, rather than a special occasion chore. If one values this convenience over absolute image quality, this is the product to own. ---  --- This is a leading edge product. To get the most of this product, I highly recommend doing the following: --- 1) Sanyo has provided an updated firmware on their website. This fixes a fatal flaw in the audio processing that some people have noted as excessive distortion - this update makes audio quality competitive with other camcorders. In addition, this firmware update adds compatability with 4gb SD cards (the limit is 2gb without the update). Kudos to Sanyo for the continuing support. (Note that the instructions are a littled distorted in the translation - what they meant to write is that you need to push the SET button to the LEFT to enter the firmware update screen.) --- 2) The video is in MP4 format and is playable only with Quicktime. For Windows users, this limits video editing to the included programs or Quicktime-specific programs. There is an easy solution. First, download the Divx codec (a freeware commercial product) or Xvid codec (a free open source product - my preference) or ffdshow (a free open source product) - use your search engine of choice to find these. Second, download a utility called "MP4CAM2AVI" (a free open source software found easily with your search engine of choice). With these two programs, the video becomes compatable with any Windows program, including just about any media player (such as Windows Media Player) and any video editing tool (such as Windows Movie Maker). ---  --- I look forward to seeing how this market segment evolves. The freedom from bulk and digital tedium is addicting and I am sure the image quality will continue to improve. For now, I am happy capturing the memories that would have otherwise been lost had I continued to own a conventional bulky tape-based camcorder
This printer does produce some fine output.  That is when it works.  The paper feed constantly refues to load paper.  The film scanner should have been left off all together (not worth using).  I have been looking everywhere for a recall on this unit (read ALOT of negative reviews).  I have been a long time HP fan, but after this experience I am going to look elsewhere. My advice is to NOT EVEN CONSIDER THIS PRINTER
If you want to keep yourself in delusions and in the dark about what's really going on in the world, read this magazine. National Review is for people who sympathize with Christian jihadists and white supremacists. Wouldn't want to be in that camp if I were you.  Read Time, Mother Jones, The Nation, or the American Prospect instead.
The warmer made such a loud beep when it completed its task that it woke our baby up. So much so that we ended up staying near it to shut it off before it went beeping! Had to also physically pull out the power cord after each use as it had no auto shut off. ---   --- [...
I bought the item form Eforcity. It is unbelievably inexpensive for how well it works. Since it let me use my headset for my cell phone
It's unfortunate that all imported Thai teas seem to have artificial food coloring, and it was a nice idea for Thai Kitchen to try and come up with an all-natural analog.  However, this tastes nothing like real Thai tea.  They need to take this one back to the test kitchen
I am still under the free 3 month trial period and love it.  I will buy it because it doesn't eat my memory and I feel safe with the people who designed the operating system. --- I reccomend
I've tried lots of coffee pods, and Black Mountain Gold is by far THE BEST!! The flavor is always full and rich, never bitter. The Cinnamon Crumb Cake is delicious.  
So I finally rented this tripe as I was curious. ---  --- Gee, making fun of former Soviet block nations/people and rednecks.. now there's some seriously funny stuff..NOT! What's next? A cutting edge comedy on the rap culture?..oops, he already did this with the Ali G show. Gross out potty humour, now that's inventive and we've never seen that before! I also like the lame-o attempt to show how Americans are all anti semitic by putting words into the mouths of those trying to sell him something. These are your imagined demons/foes Sacha and overall your film is pretty boring and about as fresh as a Yakov Smirnoff comedy bit
but 20 dollars more and hideous. I have a platinum Intuos2 tablet (a high school graduation present from 2004), and when I broke the pen, I ordered the regular intuos2 pen due to it's being slightly cheaper on Wacom's site. Here, the platinum is 20 dollars more (and in my opinion, much uglier). I recommend buying the classic intuos2 pen
It just is! Not much else to say about this
I just bought my first laptop computer and really, really hated the touchpad. I found it unresponsive at times and found the whole right clicking and using the pad at the same time a pain. ---  --- I spent a while browsing the different mice available on this and other sites and in the end decided upon this little number. ---  --- I am very happy that I did too. Its pretty small and very lightweight but at the same time it doesnt feel at all fragile - definately well made. Im about 5'11 and have fairly big hands - I find this mouse comfortable to use. It looks pretty cool too, the red panels on the side light up, which is always good for night work. All the buttons are very responsive and that middle button is a godsend after using the touchpad for the past month. I couldnt ask for better all round performance. And for $20 you really cant go wrong, it really is a great price for a microsoft mouse. The only reason I dont give it five stars?? Well this is technology - although it is a awesome piece of kit, there are always other things or features they could have added
Gave these to my wife as part of a birthday gidt and she loves them. She says they feel more comfortable than most "stud"-type and they look great
Just received radio yesterday, and am returning radio today! Pluses.... adequate LCD display and good illumination while on AC adapter. Good thumbwheel tuning in 1 Khz increments. Adequate speaker fidelity for small radio. However, the volume slew buttons have set "numbered" volume levels, and between settings of 5-6, there is a BIG noticeable increase in volume(not good), and while tuning shortwave bands, every approx 100Khz increment, there appears to be a "null" area, where signal meter reads a signal received, but quiet speaker. Also, on FM, if hands are near the radio, the signal breaks up(for weaker signals, not strong ones), and compared to my Grundig 400-PE, which I feel the sensitivity is not good and the hiss is bothersome, the Eton E-5 seems worse still!!! I am returning this today, and obtaining the Sony 7600GR instead. Eton E-5, not bad, but certainly not worth 3 stars or above, especially, if comparing it to another similar size radio, and then comparing it to my Sony 2010. 
We bought this booster when my son was 18 months old as he loved to sit like his parents.  However, he is a very large boy (35" and 34 lbs) and the tray could not fit over his legs comfortably.  So we took off the tray so he could sit at the table, and he uses the holes where the tray attaches to stick food.  We went back to the high chair without the tray - and he is perfectly happy.  We use this seat when visiting relatives which is nice it is so portable, but then spend time afterwards cleaning up the food underneath the seat where he stuck the food
The seller was amazing. I ordered two and received them by the next day. The pen writes very smooth and flawlessly. Would definitely recommend. I do wish this wrote a little thinner though
Having shaved with everything from cheapo disposables to Thiers-Issard straight razors, I have to say that the Merkur Progress is probably the best all-around razor available today. It has excellent heft and balance, and the adjustment feature is simple and straightforward. (Although I do agree that the numbered adjustment seems to perform a little differently depending on the blade used.) It is easy to keep clean--assuming you don't mind unscrewing it and taking the blade out to wipe off the head and frame. Having also used a venerable old Gillette "fat boy" from the 1950s, I'd still have to rate the Progress as a better razor; the screw operated adjustment makes it constantly adjustable, not just in steps.  ---  --- Since this is a safety razor, its performance is significantly dependent on the blades used. I've tried both the Merkur blades and the Japanese "Feather" blades, and would say that it's a toss-up.  ---  --- And since it is an adjustable safety razor, it is perfectly suited to two-pass close shaving. A higher setting is excellent on the first pass with the grain of the beard, and a lower setting for the pass against the grain. The adjustment also allows you to adjust the razor to the conditions of your skin and beard. If you've let yourself get a day's worth of stubble (c'mon--don't we all?) you can set the blade high to mow that hedge. If you need a quick clean-up before a night on the town, you can set it lower for a "Once lightly, James." ---  --- So if you want a really well-made, no-nonsense but very versatile razor that will last for a good long time, this is a good bet. The only problem might be preventing pals from swiping it, or reminding your wife/significant other to take it apart to clean it after she smooths up those pretty pins you love so well. ---  --- One recommendation: Shop around. You can get these for under $40.00 if you bargain-hunt, likewise full 20-count boxes of carded Merkur 10-blade refill sets
Watson and Crick pilfered the data of Rosalind Franklin (unbeknownst to her) and her data then led them to their ultimate discovery of the double-helix nature of DNA. Instead of acknowledging her with praise, Watson goes on to belittle her and cast her in dark tones without understanding the context in which she was working (ie, a woman working in male-dominated science n the 1950's) -- a classic case of reaction formation. Maybe a brilliant man but with poor insight into human relationships
I purchased this lumbar support for a recent back problem. Big mistake! It simply will not stay put no matter what chair I tried it with. The arch that is supposed to help relieve back pain and give support is just too much, it has you bending over backwards. I believe it actually made my back ache more.
I am in love with this product. It smells wonderful once you put it on and it really seems to relax sore muscles. The only problem I have with it is I go through it too fast (I probably use more than I need to).
You can resume EDDIE COCHRAN very well with one cd.After all,when he died he was only 21 years old.This selection is almost the same if you except 5 songs of the LEGENDARY MASTER SERIES released in 1990.His best songs are there:SUMMERTIME BLUES was of course a favorite of THE WHO ,who often featured it in their concerts.I am particularly fond of JEANNIE,JEANNIE,JEANNIE,C'MON EVERYBODY and the marvellous SOMETHIN'ELSE with it's great shuffle,a trademark of EDDIE.If you are interested in rock's early days,you'll enjoy this cd
This is the first time in my life I have been inspired to come online and write a review of a product. ---  --- When I first saw the ad for this on TV, I thought it sounded like just what I needed.  I rushed to the store, but it wasn't even on sale yet.  Finally I found it yesterday at walgreen's- and I hate to say- it stinks! ---  --- I have just below shoulder length curly hair.  I generally throw in some gel and let it air dry- I hate spending a lot of time on my hair.  But once in a while I straighten it- which involves blow dry with a round brush, and then using a ceramic flatiron to finish.  I am not very good with a hair dryer, and it takes me a long time and I find it awkward managing the brush and the dryer, and I don't do a very good job.  Plus then I need to use the iron too, and it takes me a good 30-45 min total. ---  --- So I thought this product would be great.  All in one! A time-saver! Easier to use! ---  --- Well, I was wrong. ---  --- First of all, it took about twice as long just to dry my hair as it would with my hairdryer.  It's not very powerful.  Next, it was barely straight!  Even on the "4" setting, there wasn't much tension at all.  It left my hair puffy and frizzy and barely straight.  So after an hour, I had hair that was not as straight as if I had just dried it alone- and I still needed to use the flatiron. ---  --- Don't be fooled.  It will NOT give you the flat sleek hair that they picture on the box. ---  --- I just hope I can return it. --- Guess I will stick with my CHI iron for now. ---  --- I *might* try the "long hair" version of this dryer to see if that's any better
I bake 3-4 times per week, and honestly can say that this product is great. --- I tried it for the first time to make bread - I almost cried: my bread was the best I ever made. --- I will buy it again for sure
This bra has an akward fit.  I had to return it.  A better bra for low cut clothes would be the clear strap bra from victoria's secret
The Firm(a conglomerate consisting of Nas, AZ, Foxy Brown and the relative unknown Nature(who took the place of original member Cormega after a heated dispute))...came up with the "brilliant idea" to collaborate on a full album...after the release of "Affirmative Action" from Nas' It Was Written album.  After enlisting the assistance of Dr. Dre's Aftermath Records and production by the infamous Trackmasters,  The Firm's album is subpar to say the least...it sounds like each individual artists is trying too hard to outshine the other and many of the beats consisting on this album are just a lil too sample heavy...."Hardcore" for example.  However, I will admit, there are some shining moments by all four members....and some half decent production....i.e. "Phone Tap"..."F**k Somebody Else"(lyrics are forgettable since Foxy is doing what she does best on the mic...talking about sex and its many forms....I think you might be able to masterbate to this one...LOL).  I will give this a decent try but I can't go no further than that.  I will agree with one reviewer saying that listening to the group as solo artists is a more satisfying
I am satisfied with this item. I bought it as a gift for my boyfriend and did not want to spend too much incase metal detecting was just a 'phase'! It is easy to use and beeps at the first sign of metal! We've mostly dug up ring pulls from cans and a few cents here and there. We've had no problems with it. He's used it a number of times and the batteries show no sign of running out yet. --- Metal detecting is fun and this detector would make a great gift for 8-16 year olds, or anyone just starting out their interset in metal detecting
I love this game! It's not too hard for kids to play (my 10 year old can beat it with max points and finds all the secrets) and it's not trashy so parents can let their kids play it, they keep it clean for kids with some adult humor but nothing raunchy, it's also cool so us adults can play as well! I love creating skaters and parks and the kids love the secret skaters like Jesse James and the Jester etc. ---  The graphics are better in this game than the others in my opinion also. --- 
Don't hesitate to buy this grill!!!!   ---  --- For the past few years I've been switching back and forth between my gas grill and my good ole Weber kettle grill.  Like everyone else I prefer grilling over charcoal, so this seemed like the perfect grill for me...   ---  --- I was right! ---  --- This grill takes all the pain away from grilling with charcoal.  One push of a button and 15 minutes later I am grilling ribeyes.  YES!  It is that simple.  The chimney revolutionized how I grilled with charcoal, but this is 10 times better than that. ---  --- The propane ignition rocks, the work area is great, the lid holder is a nice addition, and the water proof charcoal holder is more convenient than I thought it would be.  Let us not forget it has a dual purpose thermometer! ---  --- It took me about 40 minutes to assemble, but that's to be expected. ---  --- Oh yeah, I ordered it on Monday and it was delivered on Thursday.
Might just be me--but this is one of those CD's that the song they play on the radio is the only decent one. Maybe I'm too old for the rest--but wish I had kept the crystal so I could sell it on Ebay
Ive always stayed away from the flip/slider phones because Im good at breaking things...Ive had this one for almost six months and its still going strong.  The mini sd port is awesome
This game is truly worth the wait.  It really makes you feel like you are creating a drug empire and it is incredibly addicting.  The gameplay is awesome the shooting mechanics work great much better than any of the GTA games. This is one of the funnest games to shoot people in and the chainsaw is really awesome.  This probally the funnest open world game i have ever played to drive in.  The cars handle great and are a blast to drive.  The graphics look great and the particle effects are truly awesome.  This is a must get game
After two decades since watching Upstairs Downstairs, I rashly decided to buy the WHOLE set!!!!  As I watched the first episodes I realized my memory had played a scurvy trick on me! The melodrama was a bit vulgar and VERY predictable! Later episodes of the set improved, but not by much! It was like watching a biplane that didn't quite make it over the trees at the end of the runway. I hope you won't make the same mistake I did
Excellent machine, great performance  ---  --- Saved lot of time and desk space. Great Scanning speed and qualit
With much anticipation we awaited the arrival of Clay's second album, thinking this one would make the career of one of our favorite singers... and instead we fear that it is likely to end his career.  While Clay's voice still sounds great, the CD is an entire collection of uninspired, underproduced remakes ... not one of which goes beyond the original.  As you can see, this CD is nowhere on the billboard charts, and we're very sad to say in our household, that it's for good reason.  Save your money and buy one of the much better Idol CDs ... and almost any of them are, most recently Kelly Pickler and Carrie Underwood.
Bra was more padded than I thought when ordering.  Descriptions of products are not adequate. --- thanks, though...love shopping on Amazo
Seems to hold a charge just as well or better then the original one that came with the camer
Just received my first issue and it is just wonderful.  Great ideas and recipes which everyone can enjoy.  Looking forward to more issues
I bought 2 sets of this speedo ear plugs.  Those 2 sets shipped to me are different as shown online.  They aren't that comfortable while plug into the ears, the rings of the rubber are a little too thick and hard.
The description for this product states heavy gauge steel construction , but this only applies to the top section. The bottom straight section is made of cheap plastic . On top of that , of the 4 holes for the screws to go into mine had 2 of those stripped with a metal backing completely missing on one of them . Even the cheap logo stickers where placed completely off center , though that I could care less about. ---  --- If I had to do it all over again I would have purchased "Perfect Pushup" by Bodyrev which amazon sells 
I was intrigued by the title, which supposedly links Jedi wisdom to Christianity.  Well, after 60 pages or so, I have got the feeling that the Staub is trying to wrap Jedi in Christian cloth and failing at that. The author speaks of the difficulty in leading a Christian life.  But, I say that any religious life (be it Christian, Islam or otherwise) is hard because it turns the back on the norm or the conventional.  ---  --- I am convinced that Yoda is a Zen master; the Force is derived from Tao, not God as interpreted by the orthodox religion(I am purposefully leaving out Christian Mysticism, which is another beast altogether.). A better book on the subject of theology in Star wars is "The Dharma of Star Wars."
I love the feel of this gamepad...after trying several others this is the best. The wireless works ok, i was 20 feet away and it was working.The batteries are what needs improving according to many posts. I thought i had a dead battery but it ended up being a bad connection inside. With a small screwdriver pushed up through the bottom can take apart the battery case. on the positive side of each battery there are two small pieces of plastic. you just need to push these down so the battery has a better chance of connectiing. i also found new batteris at interstate battery store, 1 dollar each. The analog sticks could be a little tighter, but i like the d pad. wireless is great
If you wonder why you're feeling lethargic or if you have one of those little abdominal paunches you thought was just advancing age, then you might need probiotic therapy.  You might even need it if your resistance to colds is low! ---  --- Because we live much "cleaner" lives than our ancestors did, sterilizing our dishes, putting our food in the fridge, and spraying pesticides on everything, we live our lives virtually bacteria-free.  Free of the GOOD bacteria, that is.  The baddies seem to still get us, and without the good ones to balance them out, we're in trouble. ---  --- A lack of friendly bacteria in your intestines can cause problems throughout your body.  To put it in "nice" terms, it's a little like having backed up plumbing inside you, and the world just ain't gonna be right until you fix it. ---  --- I started on probiotic therapy several months ago, and I was amazed at the following things that happened almost immediately: ---  --- *That little stomach paunch WENT AWAY.  I kid you not.  Talk about an instant self-esteem booster. --- *My chronic [men, cover your ears] yeast infections decreased dramatically (even without my eliminating wheat from my diet, which I know I ought to do). --- *I had more energy and felt more like the me of years ago. --- *I became more resistant to colds than I used to be. ---  --- If you're considering supplementing your diet with probiotics, you should know that not all of them are created equal.  In fact, testing done by www.consumerlab.com indicates that the vast majority of probiotic supplements don't deliver the number of live organisms they claim -- not even close!  Those little creatures are very delicate, and things like processing, shipping, and sitting on your shelf can kill them.  And let's not even talk about what your stomach acid does to them. ---  --- Primal Defense is one of the few supplements that delivers the amount of probiotics it claims to.  (I can tell from its effects on me.)  In addition, it contains lots of good-for-you green foods that also help build that all-important inner strength. ---  --- One very important caveat about Primal Defense, though:  Because it's SO effective, don't even think about starting out taking 3 tablets a day!  Not unless you don't mind a lot of abdominal discomfort and are able to spend several days all by yourself at home.  I took one a day for about 2 months, and then I finally felt ready to move up to 2.  It'll be at least another month before I'm up to the recommended 3. ---  --- One more thing:  Drink lots of water.  You need it anyway, and Primal Defense works best when you're well hydrated
I loved the book and I feel that this movie did it justice.  The actresses are new favorites of mine, and I feel they really captured the spirit of the characters.  The movie really does a fantastic job of transporting viewers to 19th century England just as the book does.  I would definately recommend this movie and the book.
I used to like my Viking 512MB CF card a lot.  I had such a card for more than a year.  In that period, I used it in my camera.  It's filled up for several times.  Also occationally I use a card reader (SimpleTech) to write/read that card, to transfer some big files between computers.  It's all fine, and suddenly one day, when the card was half full, and after a card reader reading, I got "CF card error" on my camera.  Fortunately, after I delete a few pictures, I could move on.  I gave the card to  other people, so I don't know how it's doing now. ---  --- After that, I purchased another Viking 512MB, half year ago.  I used it to transfer files for a few times, and have never filled it up using my camera yet.  Now I am getting consistent "CF card error" message on my camera, even after re-format for several times, while I don't have that problem if I use another card.   ---  --- One theory I heard was that a card reader may damage a card.  I can not verify though.  Anyway, I will have to buy another card now, and it won't be viking for this time. ---  --- ===== One month later ===== --- I contacted with their customer support.  They gave me a number for return, and I mailed back my damaged CF card.  They sent back a new one in a week.  The new one is working fine so far.  The exchange was not difficult.  They did not ask for ridiculous things like my old receipt.  They only verified the serial number.  That's good
thease dolls are ok i agree with the other reviewer that the third edtion is wayyyyyyyy better roxxi is kinda ugly lol  phope is nic
This is a replacement for an identical battery pack that I lost.  Works great, long life, no problems
While my son enjoyed the illustrations anf fun content of the books in this set, I felt it was disappointing as a learning tool for beginning readers because it moves much too quickly.  The first book is just letters and letter sounds.  Very introductory.  The second book introduces three letter words right off with no transition at all like 2 letter blends.  That was ok to me since it was phonetic 3 letter words, but by page 2 we were already "leaping" to 4 and 5 letter words and by page 3 they were already introducing a sight word - "does" and a double consonant word - "cannot".  I thought the pace was frustrating for my son.  I was hoping/expecting a book devoted to just blends and/or 3 letter words.  Instead this program is organized by vowels with the letter a being introduced first.  I don't see that as a problem, but I was expecting more phonetic 3 letter words to start and introducing harder 4 and 5 letter words by maybe book 3 and sight words coming later, like maybe book 4.  Unfortunately, you can't see exactly what your getting until you open the box. --- Nonetheless, the audio is entertaining for children with music and humor thrown in and the reward stickers, poster, and ribbon are a fun way to recognize your child's achievement.  The practice game is basically just like the Word Whammer Fridge Phonics product but with cards instead of magnets
check out page 67 of the book for a basic reason why this book is useless: --- an entire page of a ftp session downloading openldap.  huh?  How is this helpful?  getting the right version of BerkeleyDB and installing it, or installing and configuring OpenSSL would have been far more helpful to me. --- This is another book composed mostly of cut 'n paste from the man pages, header files and varous scripts you can find with google. --- Discussion on basic topics such as replication skips over key steps, examples for many issues are not provided or are hidden in the book.  I use LDAP at work and I used the O'Reilly book to instal, configure and use OpenLDAP.  I have yet to find a question that Deploying OpenLDAP can answer that I can't get faster with google
I use large ruled one as notebook for my arab language classes, large ruled one for work, small ruled one as vade mecum (always have it with me and use it to jot down EVERYTHING that comes to mind, addresses, phone numbers, PINs, moonphases, webpages to check, you name it), large blank paged one as BOS. I just LOVE it, its durable, elegant, compact.. and widely available in Croatia, thank God :
Great movie and musical numbers courtesy of Quincy Jones and the wonderful cast.
When you have to impress the in-laws or that new girlfriend... or actually whenever you just want the perfect burger!!  These babies are preformed, shrink wrapped, and are perfect for the grill.  I have yet to have one be less than perfect.  The difference between these burgers and the ones from Krogers are immense!  I usually grill mine outside, but even when we put them on the fry pan, they come out fantastic.  I can not recommend these burgers highly enough. ---  --- I usually wait until Omaha offers a really good steak deal with free burgers thrown in and then make my order in bulk. Always arrives when they say it will and never fails to please.  One aside... the "extras" like knives and cutting boards are throw-aways... wait til there are good meat sales!!!  Also... try the beef tips... They are to die for!! ---  --- Enjoy, ---  --- Ja
Hello! I just got this new device for Christmas. I had never seen one before, but I guess they've been around for a while. Well, let me just say that this is the best gift I got this year even though it only came in my stocking. I have had more fun with the Jellifish than with anything else I got this year -- I'm just fascinated that this little guy can change your tone so big! Anywho, I would say that it's definitely not for beginners. You need to be a real player to understand how to use it. Why didn't somebody come out with something like this a long time ago is what I'm wondering! Is there a user group for sharing tips and licks
Don't order a case of these if you've never had them.  I love all the other Haribo gummies I've had (bears, cokes, burgers, etc), but found these weird and didn't enjoy them.  I'm probably just not used to crunchy things on my gummies, but I gave the rest of the case away
Have you played any of the games in the Doom series?  How about Metroid Prime? Medal of Honor? Golden Eye?  Well, then you've played Halo 2, also, because ALL First Person Shooter games are exactly the same.  I don't care how many times X-Box magazine (odd how the magazine that drools the most over an X-BOX game is the system's magazine.) calls it the greatest game of all time, I'd rather play Mario Power Tennis which was atrocious. ---  --- The story is absolutely appauling in terms of a Science Fiction orientated theme, utterly mundane, unoriginal, boring and just all around unentertaining.  The gameplay is so generic that it's as if this was the first creation of some fresh out of college video game designer, the music is cliche, the voice acting is flat, and Master Chief is just an all around retard. ---  --- The weapons, oh boy, the weapons, again another lame aspect of the game.  The alien's weapons are like something in the kid's "toy gun" section from Toys R Us, and the human guns are nothing that I haven't used in a Resident Evil game. ---  --- When the first Halo came out I didn't get the big deal, I didn't even play it, then eventually I got myself an X-Box, and decided to give this installment a shot - huge mistake.  Come to think of it none of the games of X-box are even worth owning a system for: Fable was decent, but got old after beating it a few times, The Knights of the Old Republic series was boring, and everything else on X-Box I could play on PS2 or Gamecube
The Week always seems to reflect at least three sides to every major story
I purchased two of these sports bras based on brand, price, and product description. This is a very uncomfortable bra for runners. The seams chafe and it does not "wick away moisture."  The slow shipping didn't help my opinion either. It is a nice bra for less active endeavors.
I love green tea, and tea lovers will understand that I strongly prefer the loose leaf kind.  --- However, during the day in the office this is the best substitute for the real thing. --- Enjoy!
Comment given by my four year old son Bilal, "I like this game because the buzzing things are so close to each other. This is good because it's fun. Also it'a hard to get the things out and this makes it fun. I play this came with my dad. I got the game because it has shrek on it. I win this game sometimes. The cards have funny things on them and it makes me laugh.
It is a well made movie based on a great book. I was particularly impressed by the performance of the leading actors Deborah Findley and Ciara'n Hinds. Following their play, you can feel in the whole the deepness and the manifold of the characters
they were slightly small and a tad too stiff. ---  --- but very cut
I hate, hate, hate this potty!  The shield will not stay on.  My son sits on the potty and either the shield falls off into the potty or he grabs it and hands it to me saying "here you go".  It is also cumbersome to get the bowl out of the potty to empty.  There is a lot of open space under the seat that gives bacteria a great chance to grow even with frequent cleaning.  Maybe this would work for a little girl but it is a no-go for a little boy
I've been using this for several years without ever having a problem. I like this new version even better than the last version by having everything in one control panel makes it easier than before. It uses less system resources than Norton plus I know people that have gotten viruses using Norton & McAfee. Kaspersky always rates in the top three. The only drawback is there is no anti spyware but I don't feel that is an issue. Let them worry about viruses & such & I'll continue using Webroot's Spysweeper to control spyware. Together, they make a great combo to keep my computer clean
I have these in black, and while I find them to go with just about every outfit I wear to work, I wish they were just a little (read: quite a lot) less uncomfortable. Firstly, the insole provided doesn't seem to fit the inside of the shoe properly. Almost like it's too wide. My foot is neither narrow nor wide, so this isn't something I typically notice about a shoe. There is an arch, but because of the weirdly shaped insole it doesn't provide any support. The zig zap strap is a really cute feature that I love, but it just adds to the uncomfort of the shoe. You can tighten the strap to keep your foot from sliding around inside, but then it cuts off circulation and leaves painful imprints. If you leave it too loose then you leave your feet pretty unstable.  ---  --- All in all, a versatile mary jane with good looks but no comfort
I used this when I became too sore to use my electric pump.  The milk seeps under the pump guard and it leaks out from the edges onto clothes. I wouldn't even say getting this as a pump for when you're on the go is a good idea because the leaking milk will get all over leaving you with clean up. I had to buy a replacement part because the bottom part that screws on the base of the pump cracked from sterilizing (which it says you can do).   They don't sell just that one little piece so I had to buy the actual pump again as a part.  It cost nearly $30 to order this part and it took over 2 weeks to receive it.  The entire system just isn't durable or made for much use.  Also, cleaning down into the bend of this pump thoroughly is practically impossible.
As a talisman it is good, but the product/metal it is made of is critical
this is by far my favorite mascara, and i've tried "hundreds' I have very few, and very short lashes. this mascara pumps them up, makes them look twice as long!.. love love lov
This is a great printer for those who want to print on 12x12 scrapbook pages. It works well with heavier(cardstock) paper. It also prints great photos. I have a MAC i-book. I also use The Print Shop 2 program with it. It gives me great versatility with my pages & photos
This was a well put-together game that was lots of fun to play.  You'll want to play it again as soon as you finish it.  I'm not a big Star Wars fan but I was nuts for this game. ---  --- This was the first RPG I ever tried and once I got over the fact that "I was not doing the fighting", I really liked it. ---  --- I highly recommend this game UNLESS you already have a weak relationship with your wife/kids (who you won't be seeing much of) or if your boss hates you and is waiting for you to come in late and bleary-eyed so he can pink-slip you
Esquire may be a man's magazine, but I enjoy the articles as a woman, because it is no holes barred feedback with the rough edges included. I got my first issue a couple weeks back, and found it funny, informative, great pic of Tom Petty, and I'm looking forward to more issues
The Quality is EXCELLENT! Use it to go out of the Digital Cable Box Strait into the computer. Pinnacle Software is easy to use and edit with and if you have a DVD Burner, makes great menus. I have bought and returned Well Over 5 RCA Capture Devices and this is BY FAR the best. Especially for $50!!!!!! Cant BEAT It
Yup, definately the worst Halloween movie. Come on, Michael on a reality show? Ha! What the f**k does that have to do with the series? Not only that, but the plot is completely pointless, the acting sucks, and Dr. Loomis and Jamie are nowhere to be found in the movie! Not only that, but the movie relies way too much on gore to be scary, and therefore comes off as pretentious. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE gore in movies, horror or not, but any knowledgable Halloween fan knows that the Halloween movies were always scary without the gore. Along with Halloween 3 (which actually had nothing to do with Michael), Halloween: Resurrection reigns as the worst movie of the series. There are a many more problems with the movie than the ones I listed, but I'm tired of typing, so I'll let other reviewers explain why it's so bad. Bottom line, watch ANY Halloween movie other than this or Halloween 3
I ORDERED THIS ITEM ABOUT A MONTH AGO...I GOT THE PACKAGE IN ABOUT 2 WEEKS AND WAS SO EXCITED TO OPEN IT I WAS LIKE A 10 YEAR OLD WHO JUST GOT THEIR FIRST BIKE!...I OPENED THE PACKAGE TO ONLY FIND A THE CHARGER FOR THE CAMERA...YES...ONLY THE CHARGER...NO CAMERA TO BE FOUND IN THE PACKAGE!!!!!...I WAS SO PISSED I CALLED AMAZON AND ASKED THEM WHERE THE HELL IS MY CAMERA...AND THIS IS WHAT THEY SAID "OH IM SORRY...WE PROBABLY FORGOT TO PUT IT INTO THE PACKAGE" ...WHAT KIND OF @#$%@#$@#$% IS THAT...SO I ASKED THE GUY TO SHIP ME A CAMERA...AND TO MY LUCK THEIR WERE NO MORE IN STOCK...SO I TOLD THE GUY TO FORGET IT AND FOR HIM TO SEND ME A RETURN SLIP SO THAT I CAN GET MY FULL $220 DOLLARS BACK BECAUSE OF YOUR HORRIBLE/TERRIBLE/RIDICULOUS SERVICE. IT IS NOW FEB AND STILL NO MONEY BACK...I KEEP CALLING THEM AND THEY SAY THE RETURNED PACKAGE IS STILL IN TRANSIT....IVE NEVER HEARD OF A PACKAGE TAKING OVER A MONTH TO GET TO ITS DESTINATION...BUT I COULD BE WRONG RIGHT? I WOULDNT BE SURPRISED IF I NEVER SEE MY 200 DOLLARS AGAIN...IF I WANTED TO WASTE 200 DOLLARS LIKE THAT I COULD HAVE FLUSHED THEM DOWN THE TOILET....WHAT A RIP OFF!!!!!...IT WAS AN AMAZON VENDOR AS WELL...@#$%@#%$@#q^@#$^@#$%#$$%^@...NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!
I bought this and shortly after I started using it the sides of my noise started swelling up and peeling. I didn't know what was going on and I stopped using it and it immediately went away.. as soon as I started wearing it again the swelling and pain came back. --- I am a person who doesn't break out very often and I can tolerate many products. --- I now have a permanent red mark on the right side of my nose and it hasn't faded yet. I tried to take it back to nordstrom and they wouldn't exchange it. --- This product sucks and as it was the only one I was using I know thats what caused the swelling. 
I wear a lot of Rockport shoes. Almost exclusively. I was very disappointed in these shoes. They are the same "size" as all of the other Rockports I have, yet they are too small
This is not a good product unless you're willing to screw one of the parts into your door, which we were not since it was a newly installed hi-quality door; and the way the door was designed was not conducive to doing so.  As a result, the double-backed tape which was required for the use of this product quickly came off.  You can't really expect a piece of plastic which is held to a wooden door with just two-sided tape to withstead the pressures of a person (large or small) trying to open the door.  It just isn't going to hold up. ---  --- It's a nice try, but in the end was a waste of my money
Beware of this camera! The camera overall works great. We have had it for more than a year now and it takes clear, bright pictures and is very easy to use.  Very nice compact size.   ---  --- However, as others have pointed out, the battery is the fatal flaw in this camera and we will be looking for a non-Elph replacement for fear we will run into the same problem again.  There is NO battery meter until it needs to be recharged or replaced.  We were warned about this so I thought, no problem, I'd get two batteries and be ready to switch them when charging was needed.  But what we found out is that the batteries themselves quickly retain less and less charge so that now, they last only a few minutes each before another charge is needed. I had previously thought that this problem of retaining less charge over time was only for the much older battery designs and am dismayed to find myself looking for another camera so soon.
Camenson definitely has experience in this career with many "career books" to her credit.  However, there are better books out there on writing with more information. This book follows the same old tired format that VGM books are 'not so' famous for.  The internet has more info for a lot less money
Certainly not deserving of the Grammy (for cast recording).  Each of the other nominated productions is MUCH BETTER than this poor excuse of a revival.
R-Type Final (2004.) ---  --- INTRODUCTION: --- Over the years, Irem's R-Type series has been one of the finest side-scrolling space shooter series out there. From its dawn in the eighties to the modern age, the series has always pleased its fans, serving up its share of uniqueness and challenges alike. Many installments of the series have graced a number of gaming consoles and arcades alike. In 2004, the series finally hit the big consoles of the era. The Playstation Two was the only gaming system that was fortunate enough to receive R-Type Final. How did this new, modernized version of the series fare? Read on and find out! ---  --- OVERVIEW: --- R-Type Final was released for the Playstation Two gaming console in early 2004. The game features a number of different gameplay modes, configurations, vehicles, and other variables to keep things interesting. The game is a product of the Irem Corporation. ---  --- REVIEW: --- I have always loved the R-Type series, and I was ecstatic to hear that the series was finally getting the next generation console treatment. And after finally giving the game a whirl, I must say, for the most part I am impressed. The game stays true to its roots, while at the same time incorporating just enough new elements to make the experience fresh. Let's see where this game succeeds, and where it falls flat. ---  --- -THE GOOD: --- -CLASSIC-STYLE R-TYPE GAMEPLAY. If you've played any other game in this series, you'll pick this one up right away. The game plays similar in style to its predecessors, and as such, is very easy to learn if you've played any other game the series has to offer.  --- -LOTS OF NEW ELEMENTS THROWN INTO THE EXPERIENCE. When you start the game, you'll have your choice of three ships, but you can unlock more - there are over a hundred ships total! The game also features plenty of new weaponry and power-up items. If you play the game heavily, it's going to reward you well. --- -CHALLENGING! If you're looking for a challenge, you've come to the right place! This game serves up its fair share of challenging elements, and it never lets up. Even game masters will be challenged! --- -CONTROLS ARE EASY TO LEARN, AND EFFECTIVE. If you played any installment of the series on the Super Nintendo, you'll have a pretty good idea of what to expect from this control scheme.  ---  --- -THE BAD: --- -DESPITE ALL THE IMPROVEMENTS, IT'S STILL THE SAME GAME. Even though I like all the improvements this game has made to the series, at heart it's still the same game we played in arcades and on lesser consoles years ago. If you didn't like the series then, this new installment isn't going to change your mind. --- -NO IMMEDIATE REGENERATION WHEN KILLED. This has always been a huge flaw of this series, and I am disappointed to see that this wasn't fixed. In most space shooters, you regenerate immediately after you die, right where you died. Not the case with this series.  --- -GRAPHICS AREN'T THAT GREAT FOR A NEXT GENERATION GAME. Granted, the gameplay is the most important thing here, but still, I think they could have done a little better with all of the hardware available. ---  --- OVERALL: --- Despite the obvious issues, this is one of the best versions of R-Type I have played to date. If you're a big-time fan of this series, this installment is well worth checking out. If you're not a fan, though, this one isn't going to change your mind. Still, if you are one of the many R-Type fans out there, don't hesitate to give this one a whirl. ---  --- EDITION NOTES: --- This game, it seems, wasn't produced for a very lengthy period of time. As such, it seems to be rather difficult to come by. You're probably going to have to order it online, or check around in used game stores. This one is tough to come by new.
This is the worst monitor! I thought being digital monitor it would be great. I was TOTALLY wrong! I couldn't even get it to work! Don't waste your $
Not sure what is in this stuff but it turns my fairly healthy hair into the texture of straw.  Even my own sylist said, whatever you are using...STOP..you hair feels very damaged.  It goes back to normal texture if I use my other shampoos.  I made sure to use it on and off to be sure it was the Jonathan shampoo..and it was.  It went into the trash.  Don't purchase this stuff...unless you're going for the scarecrow look
We got this for my son. We had it for 2 months. When he would get excited and try to Bounce he would end up hitting his head on the hard Toys. Last week my son hit the play bar hard enough that he loosened his top front tooth. It was the scariest thing that has ever happen to me. Nothing is worse than seeing your helpless baby bleeding from the mouth. Over the course of a week he was crying and not wanting to eat much. He lost the tooth on the 8th days. When he hit the play bar it cracked his tooth just below the root. Now he will be with out a tooth for 4-6 years. Please choose another product for your child. It's not worth the risk
Good Lord, people must be busier than I thought. If you haven't been allowed to even think about your future after retirement, then maybe you will get something out of this book.  For the rest of us, this is drivel
This is the best of the small front pocket wallets available.  Other front pocket wallets have gimmicky designs that don't work well.  This is designed on the same pattern as a full size wallet, only reduced to 4x3 inches.  Holds three cards, bills, and ID as well as having a little room under the ID card for business cards.  Great buy
 NFSU does capture the idea of 'building and racing cars' but I think they could go a little further into the design of your so-called 'pimp-mobile'. The only interior you get to design is the trunk, I think they could at least do the seats, or the wheel. Outside design is A-OK. Anything from sideskirts to multi-colored vinyels you make your car fierce. ---  The plot-line in single player mode really dosen't go that deep, your just some guy who wants to get his title back. ---  In multi-player you race your own cars in tracks you already won, but the down-side is the whole graphics in two player is horrible. ---  It is a game worth getting, but you might sell it later on.
My son likes this item.  The cars also fit his train set from imaginarium.  The only thing I didn't like about putting this together was the elevator.  Very tight fit and doesn't like to go up or down easily.  But everyone likes playing with it, from the 18 mo old to the 10 year olds
I have worn these shoes less than 5 times and the leather detailing has already worn away. The shoes look cheap, not typical of the nine west brand.  I would not purchase this item again. I thought I was getting a good deal but have simply added to my collection of boots that can be thrown on to do yard work.
  DIS GY IS DA KYING OF DA SOUTH!!!  ---  --- Give me a f***ing break. When are we going to stop seeing crappy rapper after even crappier rappers that are so full of themselves that they feel the need to plasture their faces all over every one of their crappy unintelligent so called albums!! Nothing descent to say at all, just a bunch of mindless [...]. I bet you they don't even like music, they just want to be a "celebrity"  and be rich for 3 years(till their broke). If they really did geniunly like music, it wouldn't sound that sh**y!!!! GET OVER YOURSELVES!!! 
This is a great organizer.  I read the other reviews and was a bit skeptical until I received this one.  It is great!  We use the Avent bottles and they, and all of their parts, fit very well.  There are even hooks at the bottom so hang items such a pacifiers.  It did take a little while to figure out how to make it not leak water on the counter, but once we mastered that, all is well
The previous reviews about this product were absolutely correct. The description of this product is a misnomer. The heating pad never heats up, and takes forever to just  warm up. On a scale of 1 to 5, I would rate it a zero! Don't waste your money on this. I will be returning mine
I find this a very comfortable bra for women of larger sizes.
Fable was a much anticipated RPG that promised 40-50 hours of gamer action in the storyline and complete control over the life of the protagonist. We waited for this game for what seemed like a LIFETIME and the build up for the game to finally arrive was almost more than RPG lovers could take, but did it live up to the hype? No, my fellow gamers. And it hurts me so to say it.  ---  --- While the game promised to deliver several hours of stoyline play I was shocked when I completed the main storyline in less than 20 hours. Now, I'm not one to doubt the sacred words of Lionhead Studios, so I dedicated another 20 hours of my life to uncover different aspects of gameplay, such as getting married, changing outfits and body types, becoming divinely evil or majestically good (ect.), but it was all just so linear! The paths were set, the storyline already thought out, and the character chosen, you weren't given enough to keep the interest going. I later dragged myself back to the game to play the storyline through again, and though I admit that I enjoyed the game much more the second time through, I just found myself not caring about it all. Too many options were closed and the darn story was just too short!!  ---  --- The darker elements of the game were simply addicting such as the colleseum, the prison (which I played over and over and over), and the story of your sister, but it seems as though the people in charge of developing such side stories (which we all SO LOVE!!!) got a little case of A.D.D.  ---  --- Now, I'm not saying to avoid this game. It's got just what some gamers may need to get into RPG's, but for those of us who were expecting a game to completely pwn Morrowind, well, let's just move on... or wait for a better thought our sequal.  ---  --- *crosses fingers
This is a very high quality snack which combines a hearty, solid granola with irresistable double chocolate.  I really love this product -- a chocolate lover's dream.  Yet, it's surprisingly healthy and not too sweet.  The fat/sugar content is comparable to most other granolas. ---  --- I've tried numerous granola's over the years, and this one is special.  Probably not the most nutritious granola overall, but it's definitely a treat for the tastebuds and a welcome relief from ordinary granolas. ---  --- I would not have this as my exclusive source of granola, but I will buy this many more times in the future to satisfy my chocoholic cravings.  In fact, I will probably always keep this product handy because it's highly satisfying. ---  --- Great for a breakfast, snack or dessert.  Yummy
I really love this tea. It is my every morning tea. It has the very green (fresh)taste of the tea served in Japan that is distinctive of Japanese tea alone. For this reason it is not necessarily for those who prefer the taste of Chinese green tea, and there is a big difference between the two, because its flavor is definitely characteristic of Japanese green tea. The color is beautiful - almost as green as the twice as expensive Gyokuro variety. I have reordered this tea many times and expect to keep ordering it as long as the price remains close to its present price.
This is a great, easy to use camera. I have had this camera for a year and it has seen alot of use. The only drawback I have had with this camera is that it eats AA batteries. I bought rechargeable AA's and they seem to last forever! Problem solved. I am about to purchase a second one for my son for Christmas. Great camera
The material is too stiff and forces the  pick too far out from my finger. It is also  more  'stiff' than a dunlop .60m
Am I the only person that felt this book was twisted, disjointed, and something was just not working?  The beginning was great but the second half left a lot to be desired. This could have been a great story, the author veered off track or something
I have studied the tarot for nearly 5 years and keep an open mind whenever a new book appears on the market.  Edain McCoy, who has written some wonderful New Age material, strikes an off-putting note in this one.  The spreads are certainly imaginative and are perhaps insightful to her own method of tarot interpretation, but convey confusing and ambiguous directions to the reader who is trying to understand her card placements.  In several of her spreads she conveys that a card's placement at a certain point in the spread "may or may not" mean some karmic element at play.  The whole exercise of creating a spread is to pinpoint with a degree of accuracy the situation you wish to define.  Therefore, when a card "may or may not" mean something, that interpretation could significantly change on whether you "may or may not" interpret it that way, leaving the interpreter open to rationalizing a card's meaning.  Tarot cards are intuitive, not rational, and their meanings can best be intuited when their placement is clearly defined without ambiguity   It is difficult to have it both ways and I found working with these spreads difficult.  Imagine doing a Celtic Cross reading and the first position "may or may not" be the root of the issue.  These spreads speak very clearly to the author, but not so to the reader.  I rate it 2 stars for depth and insight into Karma and past lives, but the explanations are too ambiguous.
This book was a huge disappointment. Sue Grafton and Kinsey meander all over California but come up with nothing of substance. The author spent more time describing the decor of a hospital room than explaining the murder motive. The characters and their actions are bogus and contrived. For example, Kinsey becomes emotionally attached to a young prostitute she met two days before. It doesn't work because it isn't real. It is Sue Grafton bending her characters into grotesque positions as she tries to force a plot into this dull mess. The story makes little sense as we try to follow the seemingly interminable clues and innumerable side characters. When it was all over, I still didn't know why the murders had been committed.  --- Save your eyesight! Do not bother picking up this book
It may say "Slow Cooker" on the front of the item, but I assure you, it is anything but slow! I was looking for a crock pot for camping using propane and was told this was the item for me!  ---  --- So, I made my Hungarian Ghoulash in it, glad that the night meal would be done in 8-10 hours when we got back from the beach. All I can say is, thank goodness my husband noticed that it was bubbling inside of the cooker a half hour later, or we wouldn't have had anything but charcoal left, had we left the campsite that day without checking it! It was cooking on low, and it was literally done in a half hour's time. So, keep in mind, if you are camping and you haven't tried using this product yet, it won't take long before your meal is done.  ---  --- Sadly, my crock pot recipes were put away for the rest of that trip- the campground we were at didn't have electricity, hence why I wanted a propane crock pot.
The cable is really junk.  All I want is a cable to sync my phone and update software.  It won't do it.  Half of the time the computer fails to recognize the phone is connected.  A motorola brand data-only cable works just fine.  I was warned not to invest in cheap cables and I wish I would have listened.  The one potential plus is that it has a charger inline incase you nuke your phone and need to reload drivers.  Problem is, the thing connects and disconnects constantly torturing you with the beeps of connecting/disconnecting as mentioned above.  Save money and buy the OEM part. --- Moto cord $30 with software --- This cord $10 + $30 for moto cord when you realize it's junk.   --- Be smarter than me and heed the warnings
Well the women that was selling this product decided that after she had already sold me this car seat that she was'nt makeing any money off of it, so she decided not to sell it to me.   So I never got this car seat. I really don't understand why I need to write a review on it
I was excited to find a canopy for my daughters car seat to get the sun out of her eyes.  The ad said "universal fit".  Well, it fit, but second size up  car seats are taller and kind of lean back.  When you attach the canopy, it doesent pull forward enough to block any sun.  A hat better serves my child then this aparatus.  It now sits in the garage with all the other failed  baby devices
THIS PRODUCT FLAT OUT SUCKS  IVE BEEN SHAVING MY HEAD FOR YEARS AND NEVER HAD ISSUES WITH CLIPPERS HAD A BASIC REMINGTON BEFORE  ---  --- THIS PRODUCT GIVES ME NOTHING BUT TROUBLE
This stroller holds up to 55 lbs., unlike most umbrella strollers which only hold 35 lbs. I love the raised handle bars. They cause less strain on your shoulders and back. There is a roomy basket under the seat, which is a great bonus. The 8 wheels make it easier to steer and push over rocks or grass. Once my son was able to sit up on his own, I have used an umbrella stroller exclusively. This is hands down the best one I have ever had. It is also very modern looking in black and gray
Poser user since Version 3. --- Poser continues to improve. --- More life-like, faster
this shampoo made my dandruff even worse.  after using it, it did make my scalp feel cool and cleansed, but an hour later i combed my hair and there were huge flakes in it.  if you have to pay a little more for a dandruff shampoo buy paul mitchell's tea tree shampoo or something. 
Product is excellent and does all it is supposed to do
I bought this model in order to be rid of my almost-new Sony MHCEC70 with its faulty ergonomics and detestable tuner.  Having once owned an earlier PM-series model, this new Panasonic was the obvious choice and it does not disappoint.  Like its predecessor, the PM53 is a nice, powerful compact stereo with (for the money) ridiculously nice audio quality and a good tuner, especially on the FM band.  It can easily be turned up load enough to cause hearing damage and annoy neighbors in adjacent houses.  The remote covers every function and is easy enough to figure out without consulting the manual.   ---  --- Right now, this is the budget stereo of choice for the discerning.  Sony's competing models are cheesy-looking (hog attention on store shelves,) bigger (i.e., take more materials/cost more to ship,) and consequently suffer certain cost-cutting measures like the aforementioned crappy tuner and simplified (and of course, proprietary) antenna connector.  It's like choosing between the Pontiac and the Toyota.  The Sony is for the unwashed rubes who want 300 watts of mylar-coated bling.  The Panasonic is for people who want something that makes pleasant sounds and looks like the rest of the furniture. 
When funds were tight I had a difficult time deciding which magazine subscriptions to keep.  Each women's magazine has a slightly different feel in the writing, though with increased competition, these styles seem to be in flux.  I finally decided that I  preferred the writing in Bazaar and was getting tired of what I felt was Vogue's Cosmopolitan attempt to catch a larger readership (if I want to subscribe to Cosmo, I'll bloody well subscribe).  The featured designers are more cutting edge and less mainstream than what is found in Vogue.  It's a bit snottier (though there are far snottier magazines if you are looking for extreme fashions).  Among my complaints: Bazaar is an obviously thinner magazine, and while most of Vogue's content is adverts, it does seem to have more articles.  Another item that I find highly irritating, is Bazaar's society items.  I really don't give a ---- who is wearing what at what charity gala, especially when I don't play footsies with these people.  Those complaints aside, this is still my favorite fashion magazine
After looking at $250.00 mounts, I was unsure about order at this low price.  This is a great, well built unit. I would have no problem putting --- a 130 lb. unit on it if you follow the enclosed instructions.  Hardware  --- for most walls included.  Well painted with no rough edges.  Mine was installed over wall board into wood studs.  I used the awl to make sure I hit the studs dead center. Delivery from New York to Sarasota, Fl. was 5 days.  Can't bet that
I love these!  My son loves these!  You would think there wouldn't be a problem, but he sucks on them.  As they melt, his hands get sticky and then the furniture or toys he touches gets sticky also!  But, they are so Yumm! ---  --- FYI-13 g of sugar.  Healthier cereal have 5-7 g, so I guess it isn't so bad
I received exactly what I ordered very quickly
This game was a lot of fun. The microphone headset works great. The only downside is I wish it had more songs... but I guess that is what sequals are for. Overall a good product, fun to play with friends or family... or even by yourself
Really strange cardboard mushy texture. Flavor can be sickening at times, but you get used to it. I won't buy this again. I am not sure this is even beef, has a strange taste. Not sure where the other reviews came from??
This mascara goes on beautifully and looks great, but it's messy. It's more liquid than most mascaras and, when I travel with it, the tube leaks! It also tends to smear when I first put it on, but after it dries, it's good for the day. If you carry mascara with you or travel often, look for another brand
Hands down the worst episode of the Masters Of Horror television show. It's dull, boring, and not scary. It will leave you scratching your head saying "that's all?"  ---  --- Don't even bother with this dvd. It's a waste of your precious time.
I like it very much, I use it in an outdoor trail camera for wild game and it hold several pictures and has been in the camera in all kinds of weather. I would buy Kingston again
very good tea. weak but nice aroma. mild good flavor. excellect for the price
I an not a prude but I watched this movie after it was recommended by a friend. I watches this movie with a pretty liberal girlfriend and we both found it to be extremely vulgar and not even funny, with the exception of the fist scene.And the language was ridiculous and gross! YUK
The overall quality of the garment is excellent.  The fabric is of very good quality, as is the stitching.  The sizing is also accurate.  However, the tank top I received was NOT the one I had ordered, but a substitute!  Thus, four stars, not 5.  In the future I will specify that a substitution will not be acceptable
I discovered the Murad Acne Complex Kit about six years ago and have been using it since... It cleared my acne up within weeks and has kept the acne away. Some products I tried dried my skin out but Murad Acne Complex leaves it feeling clean and hydrated without all the chemical smells. I recommend anyone with acne try Murad Acne Complex to see if it will work as well for you. --- 
I've been buying Land's End Sport Knit Pants for over 15 years (Land's End clothing for much longer).  They've redesigned these COMPLETELY (and are doing this to all of their women's pants).  Don't be fooled into thinking you'll be getting what you used to order.  Also, this resizing / redesigning of women's pants is systemic.  LL Bean is discontinuing their similar Perfect Fit Pants and having all of their pants (knit or otherwise) resized / redesigned.  Here's just a few of their improvements? ---  --- Among the changes:  The waist band (height/width) has shrunk from 1.5 inches to 1.0 inches.  It now rolls!  Fun - not! --- Next, the waist band circumference has been enlarged from 26 inches (=/- .5 inch) relaxed (when not being worn) to a whopping 28 to 29 inches!   ---  --- It was great fun to put on the ones I ordered, and even after washing them, I thought I must have changed bodies overnight.  The waist just hung.....  Dare I put anything in the pockets and they would have slid down.  When I tried walking in them, that's exactly what happened and I was constantly having to pull them back up.  I had to pin the waist to keep them on... ---  --- That's not all the changes..... ---  --- They've enlarged the bottom legs by FOUR (4) inches!  No more slightly tapered leg. ---  --- The front rise has SHRUNK from 12.5 to 11.5.  If I wanted my belly button to show, I'd go pull out a pair of my 70's hip huggers..... ---  --- The back rise has INCREASED from 15 to nearly 16 inches. Did my rear suddenly increase in size?  I think not. ---  --- They claim it is also a more substantial knit at 7.3 oz.(old was 6.7 oz).  The ones I am returning are LESS substantial - especially if you stretch them and can see through them which you can't with my old ones. ---  --- Next, it seems they have also extended the inseam length.  It was 32 inches on the old sport knit pants before washing - about 31.5 after.  The ones I received AFTER BEING WASHED had inseams measuring nearly 33 inches. ---  --- Finally, as if I wasn't feeling self conscious enough about my bod, the pants have been narrowed in the hips and thighs. ---  --- Do you get the picture?  The waist sags and rolls.  The seat is major baggy.  My belly button shows.  They have to stretch across my hips so there's those stupid horizontal lines where they pull at the crotch.  They are sucked tight to my thighs, then ballon out from my knees to the feet.  They're too long, so you can't even see my feet. ---  --- I spent 30 minutes on the phone with a "specialist" at Land's End and she couldn't explain why all the changes.  That's also where I got all of the above NEW specs.  Also, spoke with a specialist at LL Bean and their NEW specs are identical. ---  --- I spend so much each year with Land's End that I get a gift and card at Chrismas from them.  So, I'm not a casual purchaser of their product. ---  --- BUYER BEWARE AND GET THE NEW SPECS BEFORE YOU BUY A PRODUCT YOU THINK YOU KNOW AND CAN RELY ON. YOU CAN"T. ---  --- IF YOU ARE A LAND'S END or LL BEAN CUSTOMER - CALL THEM AND COMPLAIN.  THEY'VE DONE THIS IN THE PAST, THEN HAD TO BRING BACK THE "OLD" VERSION. ---  --- SO, IT WASN'T BROKE Land's End was always sold out or back ordered on their sport knit pants) SO WHOSE DIM-BULB IDEA WAS IT TO "FIX" THEM????
I have had this phone for about 6 months now and all together is has been great. I mean it dont have bluetooth but besides that its good. I have had so many hightech phones but end up dropping them and breaking them or finding them in my daughters purse in a million pieces. This phone i dont have that problem it is really made good. i have dropped it off my car going down the road and went back and got it and its fine.
I can't believe how underrated this movie is! I never saw it because I had never really heard much about it, but when I finally saw it, I absolutely loved it, along with my whole family! I'm 20 year old girl, so obviously this is my kind of movie, but my brother loved it too because the script is so clever! This movie is hilarious, touching, incredibly romantic, and so beautiful!! The cinematography is astounding, the sets and the costumes are wonderful, and Tom and Nicole are perfect together. They have such great chemistry on screen! I have watched this movie again and again and it is one of my all-time favorites. I highly recommend this film! This is an epic film that should not have been overlooked!!!
i bought this dress because i thought it looked so good on the model in the photo, but i should have taken into consideration i couldnt see the front. The boobs on the dress were very weird and pointy, and the ties up the back looked awful. It might be good for someone with a different figure than mine, but i think my boyfriend would have been more amused than aroused if he had seen me in it
Great product for the price, espeacially for a starter set. Fear not, you cant go wrong here..
As a 6th grader I think I had this book permanently checked out of my school's library for the entire year. Great adventure and suspense, a fascinating look into another culture, an extraordinarily brave girl and  her love for her dog, and a deeply satisfying ending -- a perfect  combination. I'm so glad it's still in print
I received this as a gift.  I was thrilled with the results the first few times I used it.  Then the little red light went out while I was straightening my hair and it has never worked since.  I only got to use it three times
It's a good value for anyone with NO time and a SMALL budget!  Five stars for value
I have my own ATI primium TV tuner card so I tried the trial version on this software. But I realized that once one software is using a TV Tuner Card, it is difficulty to use the same device for other applications. ---  --- So, I purchased the full version of MY-IPTV which came with a USB 2.0 external device. So, I can also use it on my laptop notebook. I like this a lot. ---  --- This company boasts the feature to watch TV away from home. But I was very happy that I can watch TV from any computer at home as long as I have MY-IPTV in one of my desktop or stationary PC. ---  --- I would recommend this to folks who wathc TV on their PC or want to watch on PC like other techy guys out there. --- I guess this turns your LCD monitor into a LCD TV.
i purchased this item with the recommendation of a make-up sales representative at nordstrom's.  i was less than pleased with the product.  I used the entire container and saw no benefit!!
Not sure what all the fuss is regarding assembly.  I just unpacked and assembled it a few minutes ago with no trouble.  Assemble is probably too strong a word, there is no actual assembly or tools involved.  As for the weight, maybe 15 pounds, certainly nowhere near 50.   ---  --- The instructions seemed sufficient although I didn't really need to use them.    ---  --- Basically, if the fear of difficult assembly reported here is your only concern, don't let that stand in the way of choosing this item.   --- 
This is one of the ultimate collection's of pure music at its finest....1 problem thou...on the inside cd cover all the tracks have the wrong names...kinda crazy if u like to rip songs for your collection :(
I love Indian food, but my son (7) is not always as keen on it as I am. We're vegetarian and tried other Tasty Bite dishes before, but none went well until I found Agra Peas and Jodhpur Lentils. My son wasn't sure about the green-ness, but after explaining it's just green peas with sauce and coaxing him to try it, he now ASKS for this all this time - really! I think these are a little milder in the "exotic" flavors and not as hot spicy. I suggest these as good choices for first time eaters of Indian food. And I love how easy it is to warm up.  ---  --- [...
I just got through with fitting the strings and they sound a lot better than my last set of strings, no troubles whatsoever, they didn't break when I was fitting them either.  If you are new or even experienced with guitar and trying to figure out what kind of strings you should get, then these would probably be your best bet.  Great tones, smoothe strings that don't grind your fingertips, and really strong material for the weekend sessions. 
The magazine has a broad range of patterns. Out of 1 year there are about 10 things I want to make.  Or I should say I wanted to make- Until I started on the first one.   ---  --- They have a high percentage of errors in the patterns.  One Issue had 13 out of 30 that had corrections.  The worst part is, they don't seem to post corrections until a reader has tried to knit the item and told them what was wrong. Which means that unless you want to do a lot of counting, calculating, ripping and reknitting, you have to wait until an issue has been out for 6 months and other readers have found the errors. ---  --- I'm working on a cardigan that I plan to give to someone for Christmas, and have found 2 major errors so far.  No idea if I will get this done in time and when I get done if I'll have a cardigan or a layette!  One more error that causes me to rip it out and start over and I'll find a new pattern or make my own.  After spending $130 on angora yarn to make this gift, I'm not going to give up, but the renewal notices I get for the magazine are promptly thrown out. ---  --- update- Still working on the cardigan, have pretty much had to start over and redesign the pattern on my own.  Still no correction online, but they have added many other corrections for other patterns from this issue. The Corrections sometimes are little, simple ones, but some of the corrections are a total rewriting of the instructions or charts!  I have thrown out all of the magazines so I don't get tempted to try another pattern from them
Unfortunately there are not much words to loose. Poor writing together with the fact that practically all facts were lifted from Cameron's 'Conversation with Wilder' which is highly recommended btw, make this book forgettable. Why going through the whole exercise of publishing it is quite a mystery
I have used this product for the past 16 years. It is wonderful!The Super Double Face Powder is actually a foundation and matte powder all rolled into one product. The product comes with an application sponge, goes on dry, gives superb coverage! I don't even use my Clinique concelar when I wear this product, it is that good! This product works best with those individuals who have normal or combination skin.
A very enjoyable documentary from the personal perspective of an ex Christian.We need many such documentaries out there to help inform people about the dangers of religion in general. I wish some brave person would do a film about how Christianity came into being from an objective historical perspective. This film touched on the subject, but it was not really the focus of the documentary.Perhaps we will be "blessed" by a further exploration of the subject in the future
I tried it on 4 laptops, and none of them was able to sustain the signal. It kept on dropping out! Mind you, two of the internal cards did a much better job than it. --- 
This product has no fat.  This is a good thing.  I like to mix it with my coffee for instant mocha
Isn't Barbie supposed to be pretty? She looks like an ugly prostitute, hands down. I wouldn't "wear that to a club" and neither would ANY of my friends. Her make up is gross, and especially the look on her face says, "Do me now." There's a difference between beauty and over-the-top trashy. You can't deny that she looks like a porn-star, which is an industry that is illegal for teenagers who get this doll to participate in, but I guess we're preparing our youth for this at a younger age now
Imagine yourself sitting in a bistro on the Champs Elysees, sipping a nice glass of bordeux as your glance pulls you toward an alluring .... You get the picture. Now buy the CD and thank me later! Highly recommended from  someone who thought they heard it all! Bravo Senor Douglas
Love the large illuminated time/temp on the ceiling.  Setting up the external temperature sensor was a bit tricky, you'll need to make sure you have a glasses size screwdriver, which I didn't have readily available.  Otherwise everything worked as promised.  I am still not positive if the "atomic" sensor is working.  The instructions said you have to be something like 750 miles (or was it 1000) away from the location in Denver etc.  I am in Detroit so the signal never seemed to sync up, but it may have I am not sure.  All in all a great purchase.
"QUINCEANERA" ---  --- Happy Birthday??? ---  ---  --- Amos Lassen and Literary Pride ---  --- One of the great Mexican tardyons is celebrated by the new movie "Quinceanera", a traditional rite of passage. It takes place to signify that fifteen year old girls enter the world of womanhood. Magdalena (Emily Rios) is preparing for her party when the movie opens but she has a secret--she is pregnant. She was raised a devout Catholic girl and the fact that she is "with child" shames her conservative parents and they retaliate by ostracizing her. Distraught by her banishment from her family, Magdalena turns to her Uncle Tomas (Chalo Gonzales) who lives with her cousin, Carlos (Jesse Garcia) in a small apartment in Echo Park, Los Angeles. Carlos is open with her about his being gay and is being wooed by a new male couple which has moved into the neighborhood. What results is a ménage a trios between Carlos and the couple, one a television producer and the other a British citizen. Carlos bonds emotionally with one of the men and the situation becomes sticky and it jeopardizes Magdalena's new family unit. ---  In effect the movie takes a careful look at class differences and in doing so looks at the gay characters involved as flawed and it is obvious that Carlos is little more than a sexual pastime for the couple of upper-middle class men. What results is a highly emotional drama that we do not see often in American films but that foreign films seem to have a knack for dealing with. ---  Performances are excellent in the film and the directors Richard Glatzner and Wash Westmoreland give us a fresh new look on the gay cinema screen. Emily Rios is a charismatic young actress of whom we shall undoubtedly hear more and Chalo Gonzalez as Uncle Tomas gives a performance not easily forgotten. He is warm and laden with emotion that glows in his portrayal. ---  Everything about this movie is fine, the script, the actors, the photography and the open description of sexuality as well as the sincerity and the love with which it was made. ---  Awarded several prizes such as the dramatic audience and jury prizes at the 2006 Sundance Festival, "Quinceanera" is a marvelous film--especially because it wears its queerness so well, the gay it balances both gay and straight story lines and the way it deals with such important issues as sexuality, maturation, culture clashes and love. --- Simply put this is an amazing film and should not be missed.
By far, the best hair straightener I have purchased. I have spent so much time, money and effort searching for a straightener that delivers results. I can now say that I have found it. I bought the 2" Turbo and it gets the job done on my course, naturally curly hair. One of my all time, favorite purchases. I never travel without it
The whole story would help us learn about the silent truth of female pleasure and sexuality. The plot, director, actors and wonderful actress in overall are much more better than other explicit sex movies such as "Lie With Me" and, especially, "Intimacy.
Great company - Terrible toy.  My daughter got this toy for Christmas and waited all day for daddy to bring home the 4 C batteries which were not included.  She was excited until we turned it on.  1) the frame is not secure and will open when you reach into the middle to change the picture disk.  2) the light is not very bright and will not work in mid-day light. 3) the image is quite small - only takes up the middle 3 inches of the paper - not even close to what is pictured on the box.  4) the clamps that hold the paper are not easy for tiny fingers to use.  5) because the small picture is in the middle of the page and the clamps are on the far edges, you can't shift the paper to re-use the paper.  You get one tiny picture in the middle of standard size piece of paper and its a waste.   ---  --- The chalk board was fine - but the whole piece slides across the table when you push to draw.  Big disappointment. ---  --- Get some washable markers and some tracing paper and don't waste your money on this suprisingly junky toy
For our first baby, we were determined to stay away from the lure of cute but unnecessarily expensive baby items.  This was one of the few items we did not research and we purchased this tub thinking any tub would work.  We were wrong. ---  --- The tub is too slippery which causes his head to endlessly roll back and forth into the corners.  The slant of the tub is also meant for a larger baby which causes his head to dig into his chin which he hates.  Bathtime is about bonding, so after a month and a half of fighting, we ended up taking our baths together.  My son prefered the skin to skin contact anyways.    --- The tub is also a poor fit for any oval sink bathroom, and the one time I put it in the kitchen sink I filled it with water and it buckled.  Never tried it again.  If you want to wash your baby in the sink, get a foam sponge or a bath support specifically made for newborns.   ---  --- Even for 12 dollars I would not buy this tub again.  Granted it might work for some, but if you have a fussy or even mildly fussy baby I would not recommend this tub. 
This school bus was smaller than I expected, about 4 inches long. I bought it for my 3 year old son who loves school buses. He broke it in the first 5 minutes of opening the package. It's a pull-back and go car. And he pulled it back too far on the first try and it snapped the wheels. They were wobbly from then on. This toy is not for kids and it's not really for playing with from what I can tell. Very dissappointed
This book was given to me by my cousin who thought I might find faith after hearing the eulogy I gave at my father's funeral a year ago, in which I professed that I do not know if there is a God or not, but that the best we can do is be good people. ---  --- I am agnostic, in that I am fully aware that there is no factual evidence that God exists and that there is no evidence that God does not exist. To be clear - if there was, I am pretty sure it would be widely publicized. ---  --- The gift was a loving gesture and I am sincerely appreciative of it. ---  --- However, I have several issues with the book. More than I can possibly iterate at this point. ---  --- This book does not even mention agnosticism. As the author was educated at Yale, I am sure he must be aware of agnosticism and chose to omit it from his book. I can only presume that it was omitted with a reason, perhaps it was too hard to explain in the face of his assertion that there is evidence for God (see below - all circumstantial and requiring leaps of faith). ---  --- Without getting into too many specifics, the evidence he uses in the Case for Faith comes from obviously Christian sources - which are surely biased. This is equivalent to reporting on terrorist acts by only interviewing terrorists. Certainly one's reporting would be validating reasons for such atrocities. To be clear I am only drawing this distinction to make the point - a true investigative reporter would look to include both sides of the story and present facts as opposed to opinion. Had Strobel intended to provide a balanced view, he would have used non-christian scientists and believers of various faiths. ---  --- Strobel's statements portend to be fact, but are generally lacking any actual evidence and in some cases are easily determined to be incorrect.  ---  --- A couple of examples are  ---  --- 1) His statement that Buddhism says there is no God (various sects of Buddhism believe in gods, state there is no Creator God or do not take a stand on the matter) and  ---  --- 2) His statements on lack of evidence for evolution - specifically macroevolution (which is fairly well supported by actual evidence and observation - and believed to be accurate by 99% of biologists).  ---   --- Regarding evolution, there is actually evidence for macroevolution - although he claims there is none. This is where I have serious problems with the book. In my opinion, the book is more for current believers who need/desire to strengthen their faith, which I believe is a good thing. However, his information lacks factual support and evidence, which to me is a bad thing. I believe that most of the people who would read it would not get to the point of questioning the information in it. If one were to question it, one could easily find their faith destroyed if the information one held to be true (and which subsequently was the basis for faith) is found to be false.  ---  --- He states that there is evidence for intelligent design; however the evidence he offers is only theory in the colloquial sense - i.e. a guess. The Theory of evolution is a theory in the scientific sense - i.e. supported by on observation and evidence. ---  --- Another example is when Strobel quotes "...when it comes right down to it, the only person or thing I know of worth my faith - the only one supported by the evidence of history and archaeology and literature and experience - is Jesus."  ---  --- The Buddha (meaning one who is awake), or   Siddhartha Gautama (his real name), was an actual person, supported by all of the above listed proof of Jesus. Mohammad was also an actual person supported by all of the above.  ---  --- His 3 reasons for disbelief in reincarnation (for regular people): ---   --- 1) If James loses 3 pounds, he is still James, if he becomes a grasshopper he is not James - because he is not human --- 2) Support for past lives - such as memories, are explainable by psychological explanations, lucky guesses, or demonic possession --- 3) The only expert on this question, Jesus of Nazareth, said it doesn't happen.  ---  --- To respond: ---  --- 1) To believe in resurrection, one must believe that there is a substance which makes us who we are that is not tied to our earthly form. It is not tied to being human, but to existing. --- 2) How do you discount the possibility that reincarnation exists by asserting that demon possession exists - there is factual evidence for neither. --- 3) To be in line with this reason, one must already accept the divinity of Jesus and that the resurrection actually happened.  ---  --- His arguments for the truth of the resurrection (below) are weak and offer no support for the fact, only that people claimed it happened. We should not confuse the fact that Jesus existed with the belief that he was the son of God and specifically that he was reincarnated. ---   --- Here are his proof that God exists:  --- 1) God makes sense of the Universe's origin --- 2) God makes sense of the universe's complexity --- 3) God makes sense of moral values (his argument is - if there are absolute moral values then God must exists God makes sense of the resurrection (see proof below). --- 4) God can be immediately experienced. ---   --- To respond: ---  --- 1) Theories can be used to explain phenomenon that correlate to reality, but are not truly an explanation of reality. One still must take a leap of faith to believe his assertion. While it may explain questions about the universe - how do we know it to be accurate? Put another way, there are other explanations that could wrap up the universe - additionally, one presumes he is speaking of the Christian God and discounting other belief systems. --- 2) See my first objection. Same point. --- 3) Science believes in hard observable facts being the basis for making assertions. The basis of scientific fact is that it is able to be recreated by anyone. To take the leap from the fact that there are widely accepted truths to being proof of God requires faith. He gives examples of ideas that most of the civilized world thinks are wrong, and uses them as the basis for absolute moral values. He omits that moral values have changed over time and are evolving. While I do believe that things are wrong, one can easily recognize that they are not always absolute...for example, it is not ok to kill, unless you are in danger - or the other person killed others (presuming you believe in capital punishment). --- 4) His example here is that you cannot prove the world exists...fair enough, but one can prove there are universally experienced events that we can demonstrate over and over again. For example, we can do a physics experiment and everyone involved will see the same results (barring psychological conditions). While we may not be able to prove that the world exists, we can confirm common experience, which is essentially what the world is...the ground on which we all interact - whether or not that is created in the mind (the example he gives for how the world may not exist is that all of the world may only be in our mind). ---  --- Proof Jesus was resurrected: ---   --- 1) The location of Jesus' burial was widely known and agreed on. --- 2) The Sunday after his crucifixion the tomb was empty, which is agreed upon by many (or all). --- 3) Various groups of people experienced appearances of Jesus alive again. --- 4) The original disciples suddenly and sincerely believe that Jesus was risen from the dead - even enough to die for this belief. ---   ---  To respond: --- 1) This is fact and Jesus did exist. Not sure how it relates to his divinity. --- 2) This could be explained in several ways, hard to use this as proof of his divinity. One can suppose it is, but it takes a leap of faith - this book is supposed to explain how to have faith - but continually requests we make leaps of faith. --- 3) Writings of people who claims to experience Jesus can hardly be taken as fact. Other religious text would claim the same about their prophets, gods, etc.  --- 4) The disciples had a vested interest in proclaiming the divinity of Jesus. This is not actual evidence. This is equivalent to stating that the bible is true because it says it is true. ---  --- Additionally, Strobel chooses which parts of the bible are literal and which are metaphorical. In dealing with "Objection 5" Strobel notes that the descriptions of Hell in the bible are metaphorical. It is hard to discern how someone can pick and choose which parts of the bible are literal and which are metaphorical. It is convenient to do so when your explanations support your understanding. I am not sure how you justify doing this. ---   --- He states that only one religion can be right or God is schizophrenic. One supposes his assertion is that Christianity is the one true religion or God is schizophrenic. This again is a leap of faith. One must also presume that the various religions are not human error in interpreting God's message. ---  --- My stand is this, we do not know, and to have faith is great, however by creating a context in which one can have faith by providing erroneous and undeniably false/biased information, a false faith is created.  ---  --- Faith should be born out of one's desire and belief system. One should not need to discount others because of their faith. To me, doing so indicates weakness in their faith - not strength.
It's a piece of junk, so save your money and some headaches. Even Dell technicians can't fix it.   My new Dell computer had Norton Ghost pre-installed with a back-up hard drive just for cloning.  It sounded like a perfect setup except my Norton Ghost wouldn't work.  Contacted Dell three times and they supposedly coordinated with Norton to no avail.  Now I'm stuck with saturated backup hard drive that is useless to me
Everyone has their favorite Beatle. Some people love to complain about Paul's solo music, comparing it to John's. The fact is that each of the Beatles had their own style, and together they had a magical symbiosis. Separately they each pursued a solo career that simply solidified what we already knew.  ---  --- So Paul's music is light hearted? Maybe even silly? Sure, but if you are like me and enjoy each Beatle for what they brought to the group, then this is a wonderful album. No you won't find deep soul searching here, just fun! And fun is what this album has in abundance.  ---  --- So if you want to curse Paul for his naivet, don't buy this album. If you loved the Beatles, and enjoyed each one for their individual talent, this is a fun solo album.  ---  --- In my humble opinion it is Paul's best solo album, as he really spreads his "Wings" and you can hear the sense of freedom coming through loud and clear. Later albums seem to become too engineered, and never seem to have the same energy that this album has.
This stuff is the worst smelling conditioner I ever encountered.  The perfume penetrated my hair and has not been able to get removed.  It took 2 days before the scent calmed down enough that it was not bothering me with its obnoxiousness.  I wish I could give it a negative rating.  I am glad all I used was a sample and did not pay money to make my hair stink
Turbo Tax is fine. The linking into Quickbooks Pro (QBP) is limited to only the most recent 2 versions of QBP. So if you have an older version (older than 2005) you have to buy the new QBP to have Turbo Tax lift the data out of QB. Now Intuit will only sell a new version of 2007 - NO MORE UNGRADES. "For the consumer" they will tell you. BS, I will be changing accounting platforms as soon as I can find a replacement. This is the problem with software oligolopies! An Open Source replacement is much needed for both Tax prep and accounting.
I had to return this item because it was too short for the side of my tub.  I would have to kneel on the knee pad to make it stretch and then sometimes the elbow pad would pop off.  I ended up trying it by just removing the stretch fabric and elbow pad, but then it became just an expensive knee stool.  The knee stool portion of this product was the only useful part to me and that is why I give it 2 stars rather than 1.  I returned it because you can get just the kneel stool from other companies for half the price
Also at an awesome price. I am going to buy another one just to keep in case the one I have needs to be replaced
this is what music is all about, the emotion in a simple legato trumpet note, or the raspy, delicious vibrato of vocalist David Sylvian; it makes me melt and feel so good and pure. think if Tweaker were to make jazz--and really chill out--this is what it would sound like. you'll never hear a sweeter sounding clarinet, ever. there is everything one could want. possibly the perfect record. it's jazzy and cinematic and the double bass throughout is enough to make anyone melt and feel the emotion of the music course through their soul. ---  --- absolutely brilliant and definitely essential.  one of my favorites from the year.
I have several Kathy Smith videos this is the absolute worse! I agree with some of the other reviewers that Kathy has not rhythm and in this video the steps do not match the beat of the music which makes it frustrating and makes her look very uncoordinated. Also, it seems like there a too many people in such a small space, the whole set looks very chaotic. I wonder if Kathy thought up the choreography for this one herself, it is very poor. All those crazy shuffle moves! Any other Kathy Smith workout will be better for you than this one.
I grew up reading Fangoria, when I could sneak it past my parents, that is.  Fangoria Magazine has a total respect for the genere of horror that comes shinning through with every article.  Now you are not always going to agree with everything they say, but you can always expect them to be honest.  When a horror icon is not performing up to snuff, like Stephen King or John Carpenter, they will be the first to point out the errors and flaws.  Fangoria also has the Chainsaw Awards, where you can mail in your vote for best horror movie, actor, ect, and you can also submit a name for Horror Hall of Fame (my guy has yet to win it).  They also spot light horror films that would normaly fly under the radar of most people; like the Japanese and Italian horrors (wow, they can make some splatter flicks), and more independent films that wouldn't be showing at the mainstream theater.  And they have pictures.  All the blood and guts you can imagine in beautiful color (though they have become more tame compared to what it was in the '80s).  This is just a great magazine to have if your a horror fan, I whole heartedly recomend it
I purchased a bag from this vendor, thinking that by being affiliated with Amazon that they were legit. --- I got the bag and thought it looked fake.  The vendor told me to take it to the nearest boutique. --- The boutique confirmed that it was NOT authentic, so I am returning the bag I got from Moda Party and feel cheated by the high price paid for a phoney, unauthentic bag
My wife and I have slightly different tasates in coffee, I like mine darker and she like a milder coffee.  This one however is just right for both of us.  I drink it daily without cream or sugar (which I only do when I actually enjoy the flavor of the coffee).  And we are on our second 5 pound bag!  I wish we had found this coffee sooner, it is great
This is a great phone that I've used for a year now.  I'd like to highlight the standout features that make this phone unique, especially at its price. ---  --- MP3 player.  Just get an adapter for the usb port (a few bucks on eBay) and you can plug in your stereo headphones.  Too bad they haven't offered an update to the Motorola Digital Audio Player. ---  --- MicroSD slot.  You can take a MicroSD card, put it into the included adapter and plug into an SD slot on your computer and copy MP3s (you can take any mp3 and make it your ringtone, cropping it will make it more effective), 3GP videos (animation looks great, but the sound was slightly out of sync, search the web for video converters to convert your content), or pictures.  I love making my own ringtones and not having to buy them. ---  --- Bluetooth.  I got an Explorer 320 headset for $20 and it works great with it. ---  --- Battery.  Easily exchangeable.  Easily slide off the cover and pop in a fresh one.  The battery life isn't very long, so it's good to have a spare battery, they're cheap. ---  --- Video camera. Not high quality video, but its something the old RAZR couldn't do. ---  --- Customization.  I love customization.  You can set up the hotkey on the side of the phone, the two on the top of the keypad, and the directional pad to go directly to most functions of the phone.  It even has a shortcut list to list all your favorite features.  You can easily make any picture including pics you take into your wallpaper.  Also you can find replacement faceplates to make your phone unique. ---  --- Speakerphone.  Works even when closed.  Good for using automated phone menu systems and when you're put on hold.  The speaker is loud and great for ringtones and mp3s.  The plastic may resonate at certain sounds though. ---  --- Vibrating alert.  VIBE THEN RING!  Why doesn't every phone have this??  It should be the default standard for all phones.  The vibration is definitely strong enough to feel in a pocket.  If you are one to show off your ringtone, let it move onto ring, otherwise be descreet and answer immediately. ---  --- ----------------------------------------------------------- ---  --- As for what I don't like.  I don't care much for the Motorola menu style.  I prefer Sanyo and Samsung interfaces.  The menu is the same as a RAZR or SLVR.  All the lettering on the outside as well as some case paint has rubbed off.  I carry my phone in my pocket so the phone has aged a bit.  I scraped off the remainder of the lettering so it wouldn't look half worn off. ---  --- ----------------------------------------------------------- ---  --- All the great features is what keeps me from getting a Samsung t509 or other more expensive phones.  This phone just has all the fee-free features you could want
Jamie Lee Curtis plays a college co-ed who and her friends throw a party on a train, and a killer is amoung them....  ---  --- A good slasher movie of the 80's, David Cooperfield plays a sexy magician, who forms his wonderful magic, almost putting a spell on those ladies around him.... ---  --- Just remember jokes could kill you........
This watch has a large display and easy-to-use functions.  I get a lot of compliments on the unique band.  It's small enough to look feminine yet still sporty.  I can't think of anything I would like to change about it
The price is good and the cable is working well. I had a very good experience with this cable.
This body butter is yummy.  It smells good.  It feels good on.  It is a must for dry skin. 
9 of 9 people found the following review helpful: --- EVERLIFE IS LITTLELIGHT, November 22, 2005 --- Reviewer: AGNAZZO (Tampa, Florida United States) - See all my reviews --- LIVING IN FLORIDA I BOUGHT TWO OF THESE EVERLIFE FLASHLIGHTS. THE PARTY THAT SAID THAT THESE FLASHLIGHTS ARE CHARGED UP DURING SHIPPING IS SUFFERING FROM SHAKING OF THE HEAD. IT TAKES AT LEAST A MINUTE OF SHAKING AFTER DELIVERY BEFORE THE FLASHLIGHT IS GIVING OUT ITS MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF LIGHT WHICH IS VERY LOW. AFTER THAT TO KEEP IT OPERATING MORE SHAKING IS IN ORDER. THE ILLUMINATION WHICH IS VERY LOW COMPARED TO OTHER BATTERY FLASHIGHTS DIES OUT VERY RAPIDLY AND NEED ADDITIONAL SHAKING TO KEEP IT GOING. THIS FLASHLIHGT TO BE FAIR MAY COME IN HANDY DURING A HURRICANE POWER FAILURE. LED FLASHLIGHTS THAT USE BATTERIES ARE FAR SUPERIOR TO THESE SHAKING FLASHLIGHTS.THE BATTERIES LAST A VERY LONG TIME DUE TO THE LOW POWER THAT LEDS OPERATE AT
Look, it's on sale! Usually 800.00 now you can get it for only 150.00. And you won't find anyone else wearing this original. Make your drunken friends dizzy with envy. Spill anything on this shirt, it has already has every color in it and no one will notice the spill. Worth every penny. As a bonus, you can also wear this shirt while hunting.
These placemats are perfect for a toddler who loves to dump food out and spread it out on the table, especially for when you're out in public places.  They stick onto anything and have fun things for kids to look at (my son is obsessed with anything Sesame Street - esp Elmo - so he loves staring at the placemat).  They're easy to fit into any purse, diaper bag, pocket so they're always accessible. 
Great buy for 20 bucks. They look nice and fit well. They are distressed but it is not as bad as I thought it would be from reading the other reviews. They look nice with jeans and a dark shirt. Pretty comfy too
I really like the Crane humidifiers for children, my youngest daughter has been using the penguin at night for quite some time.  It occasionally glugs but the most part is very quiet.  So I was confident that the apple shape my elder daughter chose would be just as good.  I was surprised when it arrived as the water cannister was much flatter and smaller than I had expected and the design of the base which controled the water flow was different.  Still we started to use it and quickly discovered that it didn't detect the water level accurately and frequently turned itself off.  This may be a fault with the one I received and so I have sent it back, or it may be a design flaw with this shape.  I have just received the soccer ball and the base on this looks more like the penguin and the water cannister is more like a sphere.  So although I haven't had chance to use it I am more hopeful of success. --- It is important to empty these humidifiers regularly and clean them, I forgot for a few days and was horrified at the build up of slimy stuff and the smell of mould in such a short time
This cable was just what I needed to connect my stereo to my computer's sound card across the room.  I've been converting old LPs to digital files, and having a well-built cable probably improved the sound quality considerably.  Amazon's price was unbeatable too
This thermometer is totally worthless. It doesn't read the correct temp. on myself, husband or baby. When my little one was sick at 3 months old, this thing read 96.7 degrees on all three of us. I picked up a digital 'under the tongue' type and simply used it under his arm. Works great--cost me $3.   ---    ---  I can't GIVE this one away
It's not very accurate because the sleep function sometimes takes some time to wake up.  But what was worse was that after I owned it for two weeks, the thing stopped working!  It was never dropped or damaged in anyway, it just stopped.  The display just faded away and wouldn't work again even with a new battery.  This one was such a waste of money, I'll definately buy a different brand next time
this movie was awfull.  supertroopers was awsome and beerfest was even better, so i suppose they can be forgiven for this cinematic abortion
I really like this--it takes what seems like no time to read the temperature
Good news Mike Leigh fans, this movie is now scheduled to be released on DVD on September 6, 2005 according to Amazon!!   ---  --- The movie is an excellent one.  Sometimes (unjustly) considered one of Leigh's lesser works it functions both as comedy and drama as it looks at the reunion of two friends from college several years after they have graduated and have been trying to find their niche in the world.  Told in a series of flashbacks and in present time it shows how he characters have grown over time while many of their vulnerabilities remain. ---  --- A must for any and all Mike Leigh fans
Watching the show I thought that Jonathan really cared about hair and its no doubt that he does still but his shampoo leaves alot to be desired. For example, even in the hot, very humid atmosphere of Houston, TX it left my hair feeling dry and unhealthy, even after using his conditioner (alot of it). My hair looks awful after using it. And the bottle claims that it doesn't use toxic ingredients like MEA but it DOES use three different types of PEG, a petroleum based thicker found in most bath products that can erode wooden tables in just minutes. This is just as harmful as MEA, especially for people with sensitive scalps and hair. And it claims not to strip your hair but the products that are supposed to cleanse are much less apparent in the product than the PEG products. Since PEG is a thickener, you're also getting a diluted, toxic, solution. Even though Head and shoulders uses MEA I find that that even that works better than this. My hair doesn't feel like it has any more of its essential oils and I've switched back to the other hair products Iv'e been using. It's not worth your 20 dollars, its barely worth 5 dollars. My hair stylist also recommended Dove products if you need hydration. DON'T BUY IT!
The magnificent frame employment, accent even more the claustrophobic atmosphere about a man in an unnamed country, arrested for an unexplained crime he is never told about. The unbearable tension joins with bureaucratic struggle to involve us in a nightmare of uncalculated magnitude.  --- Anthony Perkins' emotive memory after Psycho fit with adjusted accuracy. A magnificent cast headed by Jeanne Moreau, Akim Tamirof, Elsa Martinelli and Welles too.  --- A fundamental icon of the cinematography.  --- Footnote: It should be known that a special request of Welles around a documental that included at least some shots of the Atomic Bomb were totally denied to him. Something similar happened with Kubrick when he asked for flight sequences of the B-52 IN Dr. Strangelove.     
I really prefer the Shoumei Green Tea which is one of the only green teas I can find that isn't bitter. The white tea doesn't have any sweetness to it and isn't much fun to drink. I only drink it because it's good for me.
Following the series of Firefly, Serenity continues the story line for a few  more steps.  There are so many ways this movie is packed I cannot begin to properly mention them here.  The storyline is woven to present images not so much out of sequence but in a "solving the mystery" approach.  The english language used presents a plausible development that on first viewing is not difficult to follow or understand- mostly through common word usage that is more and more endearing with subsequent viewing.  The animations are first rate and contribute to an unbelievably real quality.  The characters are complex, focused, solid and believable from the way they are unchanging in their demeanor in all situations.  The challenges the crew of Serenity face are many: from their interactions with unsavory underworld bosses while earning money for survival to avoiding authority "Alliance" forces to the overt mortal threat of the "Reavers".  The climax builds to the end revealing some things while setting the stage for the story to continue.  The music in Serenity contributes to the experience leaving me wanting more.  I suggest seeing the series Firefly before watching the movie Serenity to fully understand and grasp the nuances of the characters
Two weeks ago I attempted to do my taxes on this software.  However, it couldn't complete the hybrid car tax credit portion so I could file.  I had two weeks until the update was available.  I downloaded it just now and entered the new questions regarding the hybrid and was told I had a credit of $3,100.  However, it never added this number to my total tax credits.  All customer support could come up with was "Start over from scratch, don't even import your information from last year's Taxcut".  Never again
I was very happy with the product I purchased and I received it in a timely fashion.  The product was not worn nor used.  It was as if I bought it at the store at a lower cost.  It was a win/win for me. --- Thank you
I remember really liking this album when it was first released, even though I could tell it was not in the same league as The Real Thing or Angel Dust. Listening to the album now, I realise it is by far the worst FNM album since Mike Patton joined. The whole album feels very rushed, it has a sparse, raw sound, very different to Angel Dust's polish. The music is generally very simple with many tracks sounding like B-sides and lacks the consistent melodiousness and sense of rhythm of their previous two classic albums.  ---  --- It was a shame to see guitarist Jim Martin depart. He had an unmistakable style and crunching guitar sound and was an integral part of FNM's style and make up. However, being replaced (for a short time anyway) by Trey Spruance is no bad thing - anyone familiar with his work with Mr Bungle will know he is a genius with a guitar and his work here on King For A Day is excellent, it's just a shame that the material he has to work with is largely uninspired. ---  --- How ironic then that on such a disappointing album, FNM produce one of their greatest ever tracks - the title track is pure genius, full of the care and effort, rhythm and melodiousness FNM were famous for. Beginning with a great bass riff and acoustic strum, it is soon joined by a gentle female voice effect and simple minor piano scale and then brilliantly builds into a tour de force of percussion and guitar work before cleverly returning to the gentle acoustic sounds of the intro where it carefully takes 2 and a half minutes to wind down beautifully - this is FNM as you'd expect them. Another track that deserves special mention is Cuckoo or Caca, a great metal piece with excellent percussion and keyboards and crazy vocals. It's scorching and funy and another reminder of the greatness FNM once held in abundance. ---  --- It's just a shame that these moments of inspiration are surrounded by so much surprising blandness (Caralho Voador, Take This Bottle, The Last To Know) and 2nd rate metal (Ugly In The Morning, What A day, Get Out). Star A.D. could have been vintage FNM but in the end falls flat, Evidence starts off interestingly enough but soon gets boring and metal tracks like Ricochet, The Gentle Art Of Making enemies and Digging The Grave are simple and sound like what most student bands are writing. However, the album does end on another note of vintage FNM - Just A Man is funny and catchy with Patton having fun doing his Tom Jones impression and the inclusion of a gospel choir at the end is inspired - you find yourself not wanting it to end. ---  --- Patton's vocals throughout the album are still amazing but should be accompanying much better material and you can't help but feel he was a little bored here - I think his heart always really lay with the far superior Mr Bungle, where he really shone and where his voice was absolutely perfect for the complex and avant garde material. ---  --- I suppose it's not surprising that King For A Day is a largely empty affair, the departure of Jim Martin and the diminished presence of Roddy Bottum at rehearsals meant that FNM's original chemistry and resources were sadly lacking and so were unable to achieve what they once had been able to. It's really an album for Faith No More fans, it's certainly no classic despite some classic material and I feel it was the beginning of the end for FNM, they would improve with their next album, Album Of The Year - but only marginally.
This is one of my favorite perfumes.  I love anything vanilla and this has a great combination of it with violets, musk and iris.  It is a strong smell, so go easy on it. One spray lasts all day.
I assume the plot of this famous tale is well known, so I won't spend time on it, but in recently re-reading this book for the first time since ninth-grade English class in the '90's, I was repeatedly struck by a piercing question: how exactly over time does drama become melodrama? Will our cherished novels seem melodramatic to readers a hundred-forty years hence? How does this happen, and is there ever an end-point to it? Dickens was by any standard a literary master, and if typifying one's age is a virtue, then he does this to perfection, yet if failing to achieve a universality unhindered by time (as other writers have done) is a limitation, then in this one sense alone Charles Dickens has an Achilles heel
Just listening to the samples of this new remix of "GOLD:35th Anniversary Edition ~ The Carpenters" I found it to be in my opinion sadly remixed very badly. Certainly not a tribute to the excellent talent Of Karen Carpenter and Richard as well. I wonder what Richard was thinking when he remixed these songs? As another review noticed and I agree with, is the bass on some is so loud it almost drowns out the pure excellence of Karen's deep resounding truly perfect voice. This is not a CD you want to get if you really want to appreciate the true pure sound of The Carpenters. The older CDs (if still in production or if you can find them used) "Carpenters Classics 25th Anniversary" a 2 CD disc 98:04 minute Collection remastered digitally, is a much better pick. Especially for those who remember The Carpenters when Karen was still alive and the original arrangements were nothing to mess with. The other CD's worth finding of The Carpendters especially if you like the Talent of Karen's deep resounding perfect voice, would be The CD "Voice Of The Heart" This is a hautingly beautiful collection of Love songs by Karen who lets each song touch your Heart and Soul making you feel as if you were right there as she sings each song. The other one I would highly recommend, if Christmas is your Holiday, would be "Carpenters Christmas Portrait"... "Special Edition digital version....Celebrating 70 continuious minutes of the Seasons best..." with Karen and Richard. There are 34 Carpenters songs as timeless as their sound,and 11 performances heard on this Holiday CD for the first time. These CDs are all the songs you fell in love with the first time you heard Karen sing. These are the arrangements so beautifully done with her and Richard. This new remix maybe OK if you have not been familiar with how wonderful the original songs The Carpenter's recorded and later remastered-Not Remixed- sounded. For this reason I give this 35th Anniversary remix a 2 star rating. These older CDs are how The Carpenders really won over their fans, took the Music Industry by storm and gave a generation of Music lovers reason to Love The Carpenders music and the sound they gave each song. Talent that can still win over anyone who truly appreciates the timeless talents only The Carpenters could deliver. As I more or less said in my Title for this review and taken from an old saying "if it ain't broke don't fix it!" or in this case Don't Remix it! --- 
This cooking utensil is unlike any other. its intricate design is for the dumbest cooker or even a gormet french dude. Little do you know that this fork can be used as a stress reliever as well. say, for example, that your  meat is not turning out well at all, infact it doesn't seem to look like  meat anymore just crap, well with this fork you can whack the meat, stab  it, and then hurl it across the yard and, trust me, you'll feel much  better
Tired of dulling your carrot-peeler?  These carrots are already peeled for you!   ---  --- Are normal carrots too big for you?  Well...these are mini-carrots, perfect for that mini-person that can't handle an entire carrot. ---  --- Sick of pesticide-tainted carrots?  These are organic. ---  --- What more could you want
We picked this up in Italy last February and brought it home with us. It's easy to use and makes great cappuccinos and lattes. We love how compact it is. It's also easy to keep on the stove or hide away in a cabinet. And of course we love the cow print. We get lots of compliments - both about the coffee and how it looks. There's no way I would trade it for one of those huge counter top machines
This is a very good product. It keeps you from having to try to mix your own cinnamon and sweetener. It's good for a lot of things for those who can't have sugar. My favorite is cinnamon toast. I will reorder it when I am out of it. It's so nice to have something with Splenda instead of aspartame
The case with battery and filter is well worth thr price paid
Don't waste your money.  I bought two of these.  A few weeks later several moles tunneled within 10 feet of the one in the same places as last year.  I put one in my gardern - a few weeks later a mole tunneled right alongside the molechaser as if to see what it was to his delight!  Total waste of money like everthing else I've tried except Nash loop traps
This product is truly amazing!  The application method can be a bit tricky and the performance varies depending on the type of mascara you use, but if you follow the directions and find a good mascara formula then you WILL have long, long lashes.  My lashes are medium length, but when I use this people who know me thing I am wearing falsies.  This stuff rocks!  I've never been able to find a mascara that can do what this does
I cannot help but giggle when I saw comments like "great lens for the money". It is selling for $440 at here, even on so-called clearance. However, one can easily find the same lens at least $50 cheaper at some decent online camera store, such as B&H, ritz camera, etc. Sad Amazon..
This a wonderful stroller.  I have a large 35lb, 2yr old and he is very comfortable.  Great folding mechanism. Folding is easy and I can do it with one hand. Nice pockets for storage
It is working well, and it is sturdy. I dropped on the ground when playing frisby, but nothing happened
I have been happy with these phones.  I find no problem with the sound - no static at all.  The only small thing I have noticed is that occasionally the sound echoes a little.  I do not understand the terrible reviews - this phone is very usable
Boots are very, very, dark brown, look nothing like the picture, fit poorly, an item that has to be fitted before purchasing
Though the design is cool, the quality of this pendant is poor.  They are so light and the color is strikingly white, which makes them appear cheaper.  They look like toys!  I also bought the earrings set with the same design and I'm so disappointed with both.  :-(  Only the packaging is of good quality in this product. ---  --- I suggest that amazon collection makes white gold of a good quality with the similar design. 
As someone who was arrested amd jailed and deported from Japan due to a  fear of flying phobia that the Japanese government refused or could not  comprehend, I find DuPont's book an important addition to helping the  public understand and deal with such phobias. I still don't like to fly,  even after my 1983 accident, but DuPont's book helped me better understand  my condition. A very important book. I hope it finds a Japanese publisher,  too
I kept getting tickets in the mail for going through EZ pass tool booth out here in New York city. My sticker was valid and I had money in my account. They had no reason to keep sending me violation tickets in the mail. Each time I wrote them a letter explaining the circumstances and asked that they void the tickets. They told the system had problems and they would fix it. Well I put a stop to it when I ordered 2 reflectors for my cars. I have not had any tickets in the mail since. I love this product. It is so simple and yet effective. Everyone should get it. The best $50 I have spent lately
I bought the volo after reading many reviews. However, it was utter disappointment. As soon as I took out the stroller from a box, and the carrying strap was off with broken piece of plastic holding piece. Yes, the stroller is light, and very very flimsy. I returned it right away
I say almost due to the fact that Aperture gives them a good run for the money. You know those photography magazines with about 10 pages of pictures and articles and the rest is advertising? This is not it! If you enjoy a magazine that delivers informative photographing techniques, get this one! If you are interested in seeing the work of other photographer's, get this magazine! If you want a hot collectible, GET THIS MAGAZINE!!! Yes there are ads in here, but not a ton of them. For you guys (and girls) out there who love to see the occasional beautiful star photographed, get this magazine. One of the aspects of this magazine that I like, is the fact that the photo layouts are sometimes full page, unlike some magazines where you have to get out a magnifying glass to view the photos. And this one IS a hot collectible, though the French version of it is an even hotter collectible. Whether it's nature,  special effects, or provocative photography, this one is a superb magazine. In short, this one is a must get for the photography fan
After using these radios two months I can say that battery life is poor.A full charge doesn't hold three hours.Perhaps my batteries didn't come in good condition. I didn't use them on AAA yet... 10 mile range is not true in a normal environment, open sea or desert perhaps.Product works fine while battery las
We asked for 2 of these and got both. The material was itchy and scratchy and never got softer. It was very thin and you could see the pattern through the sheet. It was easy to put on mainly b/c it was a bit big. They ended up in the closet in no time
sucks. If you like this album you are a poser. That means you think cradle of filth is black metal and slipknot is death metal. One guy I know that listens to norma jean, as i lay dying, and unearth, called me emo for listening to acid bath. How stupid can you be? You posers need to wise up and listen to real metal, such as Morbid Angel, Darkthrone, Amon Amarth, OLD Sepultura, and Dissection
i bought this item as so many people has said how much they loved it.  i find it a nightmare!  if you stand in the corridor between the monitor and the receiver it cuts out.  it does not work when on the charger.  it does not work unless there is a clear line between the two parts. what a piece of junk.  I would in no way recommend this product to anyone
This film was probably hurt a bit by the fact it had to have its fall 2001 release postponed due to 9/11(it's plot included terrorists that sell a bomb). I also imagine the marketing was tough since it had to be sold based on Tim Allen and the comparisons to "Get Shorty" rather than as a plot driven movie. I tell you though, this film is simply funny.  ---  --- Just like an old Marx Brothers film, the plot is there only to set in motion the quick-witted dialogue and interaction between the characters. I have enjoyed both of Dave Barry's humor novels(this and "Tricky Business"). They made me laugh out loud as did this movie. I think it captures the spirit of the book perfectly.  For those that have laughed at Dennis Farina from his roles in "Get Shorty and even "Snatch,"  he has never been funnier as a hit man who encounters unexpected roadblocks(literally) on his trip to do a quick sniper job.  Tom Sizemore is also excellent as the dumbest crook you'll ever see.  ---  --- There are some movies that you may see once in the theaters yet can watch over and over everytime it is on tv because it retains the ability to always make you laugh, no matter how many times you have seen it.  ---  --- Check this one out! 
The first order I received for Italian 1 and 2  had defective disks, which were not replaced by the manufacturer when I called their customer service.  When I re-submitted my complaint to Amazon, they immediately sent me a replacement of the whole set. However, these disks also are very slow to load on my new MacPro laptop, and quit at times. I am not able to recommend Rosetta Stone
I did not enjoy this book at all because it was writen in a very distracting fashion.  While it was unique, it was too hard to get into.  I also really hated the story, it was also too confusing to follow, to strange to enjoy, and to boring to care.  I totally hated this book and it was near torture and a waste of time to read.  The only reason that I read this was because it was for my book club.  The reivews, by the way, in the club were 50/50.  Some loved it, the rest of us hated it.  There was no in-between.  I would only recommend this book to someone who is into odd literature or to English majors, I'm not sure who else would like it
At last!  A full-length Jimmy Buffett concert on DVD!  It's been a while coming but this is a beauty.  There are so many highlights it's hard to know where to start - perhaps the best place is the overall quality of the DVD.  The sound is superb, the camera-work spot on and the real essence of a Jimmy Buffett concert is captured perfectly.  The song mix is terrific - everything from Buffett classics like Volcano, to new classic like Piece Of Work, to iconic covers like Southern Cross.  Seeing Jimmy and the Coral Reefers perform in daylight and night-time is a nice touch and the crowd shots show why a Buffett concert is such an all-encompassing experience!  For me, a favourite moment is the concert finale of Steve Goodman's City Of New Orleans.  Steve now resides under home plate at Wrigley and I'm sure he was singing along as well.  Buffett fans and new Parrotheads alike will find this DVD one to watch many times over
A useless piece of junk.  Worked for 3 minutes then broke.  Have since bought a Motorola-brand one for three times what I paid for this piece of junk.  Do not be attracted by a cheap price tag, because you get what you pay for (or what you DONT pay for in this case). 
I was extremely disappointed when I received this product.  Contrary to the description, the handles are hard plastic - not "comfortable and soft" as it states on the product packaging and website.  Other than that it may be a decent product, but after only a few reps your hands will hurt and will have the design from the grips imprinted on your skin.  I've already printed the label to return to Amazon. ---  --- Beware the other review of this product, the individual posted the same review for all ab wheels sold on Amazon.  Not only is it not informative, there is a good chance they have never tried the product
As very frequent (often long-distance) travelers, we routinely purchase airline tickets for our daughter so that she can travel safely and comfortably in her car seat on plane trips.  We really pushed the size limits of the car seat that integrated into a stroller (the Graco travel system) for ease of use, but once she had finally made the dreaded transition into a larger seat, we tried practically every method for moving the seat, toddler, diaper bag, collapsible stroller, carry-on, etc., from our home to and through the airport without ending up completely exhausted and frustrated.    Of all of the options that we tried, the Pac Back was the most consistently comfortable and convenient.  I'm not very tall (5'5"), and find that I can manage to wear the Pac Back, stow loose and light objects (such as coats or stuffed animals) in the car seat itself, sling a diaper bag over one shoulder and a purse on the other, and still have enough mobility/agility to bend down and pick my daughter up or hold her hand.  (Granted, I look like a Pac Animal, but that's a small price to pay for having free hands at key moments.)  The  strap system is intuitive to use and seems well-constructed.  Compared to a car seat bag, the Pac Back is much more easily removed from the car seat once on the plane, and I have never had any trouble replacing the straps in a minute or two -- plenty of time to have the seat on my back by the time people start exiting the plane.  The straps adjust easily enough that my taller husband and I can take turns carrying the seat when we travel together without spending a lot of time situating ourselves.  The only drawbacks: you really have to pay attention while wearing what amounts to a giant rigid backpack that you don't bash someone or something while turning, and the straps may have to be removed to go through security IF the x-ray machine has an extremely small opening (only happened once or twice at regional airports).  Overall, an amazingly simple but incredibly helpful product.
Smells DIVINE! This is a powder-sweet and refreshing scent that won't overwhelm the senses. It's soft and subtle, yet killer if it complements your body chemistry. I love using this particular fragrance (especially during special occasions). It exudes both simplicity and sophistication--wonderful qualities that make me feel so feminine and utterly sexy!!! Try it
DO NOT order.  They only placed an order for 7 months but I got billed for 12.  After 3 hours on the phone they said that 7 months was all the publisher had available and they cannnot extend it.  After pitching a fit they offerred to give me a partial refund but cannot extend the subscription.  Only order from the magazine itself
Truth-be-told, I hated "HAVING" to give this magazine even one star, but that was the least I could do via this rating system. This magazine has some good writers but needs a new editor. Mr. Shoaf is very bad at his job, clearly, and seems to use and reuse the "buddy system" in using writers. Perhaps he gets a kickback? At any rate, this is, overall, a cruddy example of journalism. My facts tell me it should fall under fiction rather than nonfiction in many issues. I am done with it. Get a new editor and perhaps I will reinvestigate the publication. Until then, so long. I have no time for absolute rubbish
Avent makes the best washable baby bottles around, so we felt that their sippy cups would be just as good. Well we were wrong. Of the five cups we had, all of them leaked and have since been thrown out. The cups are five different pieces vs other brands that use three  pieces, which makes them harder to wash, harder to put together, and more pieces to lose. As far as sippy cups go, these are among the most expensive you can buy and worst that we used out five different brands. We have had great luck with Greber's and Playtex's. Please avoid
It's quality is cheap and poorly made.  I bought two thinking it was a good deal but I threw them out after 2 days because the on/off switch didn't work.  It was also very loud
What can I say?  If you're a Steelers fan then you must have these!!!!
I ordered the black one. According to the photo provided, it was supposed to be black with white seams, but when i received it, it was all black. Once I put it on it fitted perfectly. But it is simply too difficult to put on even though it is the right size.
This is very good peanut brittle, I found no taste compromise even though it is sugar free.  In fact I found it superior to regular brands of peanut brittle I have eaten.  Most peanut brittle is hard as a rock, this brand had a perfect crisp crunch.
I was getting some boning too but didnt mind.  This ensemble is a lot of fun to wear once its broken in.  I wear mine all the time
I bought this cable. My first peeve was that it was shorter than the original Palm Hotsync cable, but my major issue is that a few weeks of use were enough to break one of the little tabs that holds the contacts firmly in place, so WATCH OUT, and treat this cable nicely. I like the retracting cable concept, but was disappointed in how easily it got damaged
I use this toolbox in my Senior Move Management business. We carry tape guns, labels, tools, first aid items, cleaning supplies, door stops, forms, and about a jillion other items in it. I did modify it slightly, cutting off some of the flaps because I like to be able to see where things are and not have to look under the flaps. We had one similar to this one once that was made for men's tools but the handle was just a tiny bit too short and it actually wasn't as sturdy as this one. This is my favorite toolbox. 
I just ordered a pair of these for my son, since my daughter is so pleased with them.  The wheel base is wide enough that beginners can get their balance quickly.  The wheels roll very smoothly.  The velcro attachment at the top provides ankle support, and is easier to adjust than just laces.  A fun outdoor activity! ---  --- Laurie, mother of Emma (8) and Kevin (11

I'm taking it back to the store ASAP!!  According to the programs, I have a full signal on both the keyboard and the mouse while typing, but you see what comes out!  Not once have I had a low signal warning or anything.  I just get random intermittent letters to appear.  Now, perhaps it's because the receiver is back by my monitor and the keyboard is on the keyboard tray, but my goodness!  This thing is supposed to have a range of 6 feet.  I measured and they're about a foot and a half apart!! ---  --- I type for hours on end per day and have been typing "properly" for about 16 years.  I type much too fast and much too frequently to be able to deal with such random signals!!  Another thing I noticed about the 6000 (and actually was concerned with it while I was trying it out in the store) is that it makes my fingers feel cramped.  Perhaps it's due to the curve of the keyboard and I'm just not used to it yet (although I have used split key ergonomic keyboards and never had a probelm with them.  The 4000 felt fine (even though it has a somewhat awkward layout!!) ---  --- No matter what, that thing is going back!  I'm far too agitated to keep it! ---  --- Oh, there are some neato plusses!  I love the shortcut keys.  It's nice to be able to just hit one key and get my e-mail, my music, my pictures, or whatever else I assign the keys to.  I had gotten excited about that feature, and will be sad to lose it (even though I only had it for about an hour.) ---  --- Better luck to the rest of you
I am very pleased with this camera. I especially like the light meter that tells you how many apertures you are away from the correct exposure. I am using this for my photo class and is easy to use
