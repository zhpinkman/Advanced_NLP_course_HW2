Dont waste your money on this one. the picture is cute. but the quailty of the toy isnt any good. the frosting doesnt even stay in the hole and the box is flimsy it would never last with a child. the concept is supposed to be like the game memory,your supposed to turn over the donuts and match the ones with the same frosting. your better off just buying the real memory game. the only thing this is good for is the pretend food concept and even with that it isnt worth this price.
This switch works really well.  I use it between a Windows XP and Windows 98 operating systems.  When switching to Windows 98, control to the mouse and keyboard is switched nearly instantly.  However, when switching to the XP OS, control time varies from nearly instantly to 3 or 4 seconds.  I also like the fact that it controls both the mouse and keyboard with one USB port on the PC.  It frees up a port.  Using the Numlock key on the keyboard is the hot key to switch.  It also has buttons on the device itself to select which PC to control.   --- I rate this product 5 stars.  When I posted the first time, I thought I put 5 stars; but I must have accidentally selected 2.  I recommend this switch to anyone who wants a good product at a low price
I got this last year from Amazon.com during one of their bundle specials with the hammock stand.  It's a nice hammock and comfortable for the most part. My only complaint is that the ropes are too elastic.  While it's very relaxing and conforms to your body, after about 30 minutes of laying or sitting on it, you have to get up and retension the hammock to keep your body from dragging along the ground (I'm a lightweight at about 135 lbs).  It's possible that I need to break it in more since I've only used it about 10 times, but right now it kind of annoying that I can't just relax without worrying about feeling the ground beneath me
Tired of hearing your baby cry?  This is the monitor for you.  You'll be lucky to hear any sounds from your baby on this thing.  Looks like Evenflo  was being literal when they named the product Whisper Connect.  You can barely hear anything at full volume.  I'm going to return it tomorrow if I can resist backing over it with our car.       
Does a good job for what it was designed for... did have some trouble "recognizing" certain types of batterie
Works great, everyone needs this tire gauge.  It is easy to use and easy to read. 
We returned this video camera due to video picture quality. The camera requires a lot of light to have a decent video, even after changing settings, the video had a "grainy" look. We just needed something basic to replace our 10 year old video camera and thought this would work, but the picture was worse than our previous camera. Purchased the PV-GS65, next model up with 3CCD's and love this model. As a matter a fact we still had the GS-31, used the same tape, shot the same footage, and reviewing the two different shots, the GS-65 did 100% better.  ---  --- The camera has a great feel in your hand, although the menu button can be difficult to press
I just got this from Khol's. They had it on sale for $11.99. When I saw it, there were plenty on the shelves. I was kind of curious as to what they were because of its funny shape.  There was a try me sign on there. So in my boredom, while waiting for my ride, I read the directions on the back and actually tried it. It was kind of funny to read 'wind up for light'. ---  --- I'm glad I checked out the aisle. I've never seen anything so cool. ---  --- It's very simple to wind-up the flashlight. The ball has a special roller that allows you to pump easily. It's not difficult to follow the instructions. Anyone could do it.  ---  --- The lightbulb is LED so according to my internet research LED: --- "LEDs have an extremely long life span, twice longer than the best fluorescent bulbs and twenty times longer than the best incandescent bulbs. --- " ---  --- The design is actually very nice to the touch. It's padded with some nice rubber grip, so its not unpleasant to hold. It's not very heavy at all. It's about the size of a male's electric shaver. ---  --- I bought it at Khol's for more money than its listed here on Amazon. I got it today and I showed my younger siblings. They loved it, too. ---  --- Basically the light is powered by the mechanical motion of your hand. It's really simple to use and its a comfortable design. I plan on going back to get more tomorrow.) 
This wipes warmer dries out the upper wipes overnight.  The screws in the upper lid rusted after a few weeks.  The rust dripped down into the wipes container and contaminated the wipes on the bottom. I have another wipe warmer by Dex that doesn't seem to dry out the wipes and I have never seen rust
They changed pretty much everything. For starters they completely removed all of the normal menus such as File, Tool, and Edit. Which means you can't use the keyboard for quick and easy menu access. Well maybe you can, but you would have to memorize all of the commands instead of having the nice little visual cues which made previous versions of Office (and almost all other PC programs) so much easier to use. You basically have to use the mouse for everything. And in my experience there is no faster way to repetitive stress injury than over-mousing. ---  --- The Ribbon is just awful. First of all it's huge. It takes up about FOUR TIMES the space of my customized toolbar. They place nearly every button imaginable on it. And as far as I can tell you can't change it around or simplify it. Every function is displayed all the time whether you need it or not. Which makes finding anything a real pain in the neck. You can make the ribbon retract which at first glance seems nice. But in reality it turns what used to be simple 1-click operations into 3-click operations (extend ribbon, spend several minutes searching for button, click button, retract ribbon). Good grief! What a pain. ---  --- This software didn't last 24 hours on my system before I restored my old version of Office. This new interface is about the most awful thing I've ever seen on a computer. I know of certain free open source office suites that I prefer to this monstrosity. That being said I still prefer any and all previous versions of MS Office to the free one. In fact I would rather be using my old Wordperfect from 1995 than this *thing* that MS is trying to shove down our throats. If only I hadn't thrown that disc away six years ago... ---  --- Before you "invest" your money in this software I strongly recommend you download the free trial version. Then buy an earlier version
We originally got this to replace the "fan noise" in the winter due to our sons' room being so cold.  The first couple days the sound seemed so loud but you quickly get used to it.  We've discovered it's very helpful for blocking out the noise of other children running through the house while our newborn is sleeping in addition to the city noises at night.  With the adjustability dials it's ideal for a nursery or bedroom for those who cannot sleep without a fan.  It doesn't however, cover the sound of someone coughing or snoring loudly.  Would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a sound machine for environmental noise, especially for children
Doesn't work on Mac like it says that it does louses up your machine not worth i
Look what I found?  Where?  Under  there!  Under wear? ... Right there! It says, "Be the first person to write a review"  for Jockey Boxer Briefs.  Hmmmm...  no wonder no one has  reviewed these  yet -- who writes a review for men's underwear?   ---  --- Ok, fine, I'll do it.  I love these, my preferred brand and style. Your brand and your style may vary as this category of apparel tends to be a personal preference item. ---  --- I only buy these in black as I am a firm believer that underwear (men's especially) should not be white -- as by the time the end of the day rolls around and it's time to change them  -- it's better to be left  wondering  what might be there as opposed to seeing it so prominently displayed on a white background! ---  --- These hold up well for the price.  Nothing lasts forever. The elastic band is usually the first to go (after many repeated washings) before the material gives out.  i.e. they will fall off before they rot off.  ---  --- Finally, so I can feel like I have done a complete job in reviewing these, I had a buddy of mine help with the ultimate test - the Weggie test - and these shorts handled it well...  extreme pain was reached well before the structure and/or material of the boxer short failed.  I give these a "ten tippy toes" rating for how well they performed in the test.
I bought these shoes and they only lasted four months. The leather sole was REALLY slippery and never did make it easy to walk with them on. By the last month i had them, the sole had totally separated from the upper. I thought Florsheim shoes were good; maybe years ago, but not now. These shoes are NOT recommended at all
I am a beginner learning guitar and this product helps me tune my quitar in a jiffy.Awesome product
I bought this for Christmas for my three children ages 4 (twins) and 18 mos. Although the younger child doesn't really get the games we play with it, the older ones do and we all have a great time. My goal was to get them to be active during the winter (less TV time), and this works for about 30 minutes. I only wish we had a bigger house so I could have gotten the bigger parachute. I can't wait to play with it outside when it gets warm
Marmite is great. its like eating the stuff you would scrape off the sole of your shoe after you'd been walking around in an old factory for a day. I think it tells about the character of a small island population that came to rule the world. Thank god, they left before they had the rest of us eating this filth
When it comes to Big Star's 70's output, you can call me a HOPELESS FANBOY, because after listening to In Space, it seems that ONLY a hopeless fanboy would think that thirty-some-years later, exactly one-half of the classic Big Star lineup could---or in forever difficult Alex Chilton's case, WOULD be so inclined---to attempt to recapture the lightning-in-a-bottle transcedent pop magic that made those 70s discs so great.  This disc has WAY MORE in common with Chilton's oft-times difficult, mostly self-indulgent solo work than with any of Big Star's previous fascinating pop near-perfection. While I'll admit that I have enjoyed a good chunk of Chilton's solo work, (in a slightly guilty, rolling-my-eyes, "Oh...that Alex!" sorta way...) my musical sensibilities are somehow offended by the fact that THIS group and that THIS particular collection of songs are presented as "Big Star."  In Space is connected musically to the original Big Star by little more than the fact that two of the same guys in THIS BAND were in THAT BAND.  If you don't expect much, you won't be disappointed.    
The plastic stand that holds the frame upright broke immediately. Also, be sure to note that there is no memory card. Spend the extra money and buy something better. I wish I had
I just purchased 5 pairs of the dickies everyday scrubs (from another online company) because they seemed inexpensive, durable, and came in many fun colors. I was sorely disappointed. The colors are pretty, but the material is  crummy. Its rough, flimsy and feels like plastic. The pastel colors (citron, cool mint etc) are almost see-through and definitely show patterned underwear. The tops run quite large (i wear a 6-8 on top and the medium is VERY Roomy, i would definitely get a small if i were to ever order them again).
This software messed up my computer big time.  It does something first of all, to Microsoft word.  Word does not work properly after installation of Photo Explosion.  It then went into different areas of my computer and screwed it up.  At first I only suspected it to be Photo Explosion.  I had to have my computer sent back to HP.  When I got it back I reinstalled Photo Explosion and the same thing happenend.  BE CAREFUL.  Product has BIG PROBLEMS - WHICH WILL GIVE YOU BIGGER PROBLEMS - I GUARANTEE IT.
We've had a number of Gazillion bubble machines.  --- The first - this one, with an upright rotating set of bubble wands - worked relatively well, but stopped working after maybe a dozen uses.  (Granted, one of those uses was for a few hours).  When the level of liquid is low, the machine stops making bubbles since it has to pick up enough liquid to cover the wand.   ---  --- We replaced it the next year with the Typhoon machine - this was awesome, produced a huge quantity of bubbles and worked more reliably since the bubble liquid is sucked up and put on the wands, no matter how low the supply of liquid.  It has a large reservoir at the bottom so you don't need to fill it very often - it takes a lot of liquid though.   ---  --- Our issue now is getting the liquid.  Gazillion liquid does produce the best bubbles - they last well, etc. etc. etc.  HOWEVER, very few stores stock the liquid, and except for when I first bought the first machine, no-one stocks large size bottles.  Even the online vendors like toys.com who are supposed to have them, never have them in stock (I've been on their notify list for a long time!)  I've ended up buying from someone in Canada on eBay - otherwise, buying the smaller bottles at ToysRUs, Target, etc. is just too expensive.   ---  --- Both of these machines don't really work if you try other bubble liquids - other liquids (especially the cheaper kinds in very large size bottles) are much thinner and the liquid drips right off the wands before it has a chance to pass by the blower part to make any bubbles.  ---  --- We're planning to start making our own bubble liquid and hopefully that will cover us.  Otherwise, the machines are useless now. 
This is my 2nd set of these type of curlers.  The last ones stayed with me for three years.  They are so good, I stopped using the "big, home set" and use these type daily.   Heat up fast, great lasting curl (particularly for hard to curl fine hair), and don't even need to leave them in that long. ---  --- Would have given them a 5 - but this set has the awful plastic clips that can leave a kink in the curl.   Recommend getting or using a set of the old-fashioned wire clips that come with most non-travel sets if you want a smoother curl
I bought this from Sephora.  It left my hair a greasy mess.  And I have dry coarse hair.  It was very greasy and didn't rinse out well at all
I bought the entire line of products from the Lisa's Hair Regimen on the Carol's daughter website. I took all the products back to Sephora yesterday. I used this Hair oil on my scalp and the next day my scalp started itching. I washed it that night and woke up the next morning in serious pain. I wear my hair natural and I had what felt like chemical burns all over my scalp. When I took the product back to Sephora the lady who sold it to me told me my scalp was RED w/ white spots all throughout it. I had to take OTC pain medication twice a day for three days just to help me sleep at night due to the pain. The only thing I can attribute it to is an allergic reaction. The product contain extracts from different types of plant and flowers. If you have allergies to these items I would suggest not using this product. I contacted Carol's Daughter and have not heard back from them yet. I would have expected more from the company who's product states 'Made with Love, Peace'.
I have 2 wipes warmers - one for upstairs and one for downstairs.  At one point, I had this particular wipes warmer and it just does not work - mine took FOREVER to warm the wipes and would only warm the bottom section; same as previous reviews, the lid would not stay shut and the wipes would not pop up properly.  I have two other different brands of wipes warmers that work fine.  Do not waste your money on the Munchkin warmer
I was waiting for this cd for a very long time, i mean i love all Greg's album, they are intense, passionate, but Amber Headlights is giving me back the soul of the Afghan Whigs, somenthing i missed a lot for a long time . I love his voice, the way he sing, the way he loves his music. You can t explain the beauty of this cd, there are great rock-blues-love songs:the first time i heard "So Thight" it makes me jump up and down my room (i haven t done it for long time since Black Love "Going to town"), then Cigarettes (what a great song, this time i only remember i was singing the chorus with "Gentleman" in my hand), then "Domani" that in italian means tomorrow, kind of Greg's jazz slow song in which his voice is so low that you can t even try to sing like that.Then song after song i realized is the best cd i ever bought after so many years. If you don t know anything about Afghan Whigs and Greg Dulli then it is time to start to listen one of the best alternative artist of our time. --- 
This was the first silent film that I saw in its entire form. The 1927 King Of Kings, directed by Cecil B. Demille. As with D.W Griffth, Charlie Chaplin, and Greta Garbo, he is right up their amoung silent icons. This movie, starring H.B. Warner as Jesus is a truely a jewel of a film. Everyone knows the story, but it is told very well here. Demille knew his bible films, like Ten Commandments(1924,1956) Samson And Delilah and this movie, The King Of Kings. The film maybe dated a tiny bit, but can the story of Jesus be dated. I love Jesus movies, like Jesus Of Nazareth, The Greatest Story Ever Told. The 1961 King of Kings, and the musicals Jesus Christ Superstar and Godspell. And the story of Christ was also tackled in the 1916 D.W Griffth classic Intolerence. But this film is broughhow much t out in much better detail. The special effects are amazing for 1927, the crucifixion scene is astondishing,and a scene in color, which is the resurrection scene.The cast of characters is also amazing. In our era of movies, if you need a big scene, a will have only 100 people, and CGI the other tens of thousands. Since there was no CGI back in 1927, or computers for that matter, they directors like Demillie and Griffth had to actually get thousands of extras for there scenes in these epics. I know people think silents are boring but for an 18 year old, they are a gateway to the past. Without those groundbreaking films, no one would care about movies. Those early silents were the catalyst for what would become. I would recommend this film.  This movie is a true classic, no matter what religion you are
I much prefer irony to tragedy, and after Blue I was not sure what to look forward to with White. I wound up liking White a lot. Movies about "the human condition" are, for me, almost invariably obvious. While this movie does quite a bit of exploring about how a man reacts to love and the withdrawing of love, impotence and the power of performance, revenge and a circling back to love, I thought it was handled with such off-hand, dead-pan humor as to be a very sweet film. In a way, it struck me as an amuse-bouche, one of those unexpected treats that a first-rate chef will surprise a good customer with at the start of a meal or sometimes in between courses. The movie has that quality of freshness and unexpectedness.  ---  --- Zbigniew Zamachowski does a masterful job as Karol, a sad sack if there ever was one, who gradually shows determination as well as obsession. I suppose one must just accept obsession as an unexplainable plot device in a movie, but Dominique got off to a very unsympathetic start. She'd wilt most men. Karol's obsession with her seemed a bit unreal. I found Karol developing into a resourceful, intelligent guy whom I began to admire. Dominique, though, didn't seem to change much. After all she put Karol through -- unnecessarily cruel most of the time -- I couldn't empathize much with Karol, but simply accepted things as the reason why I was enjoying the movie. I couldn't help thinking that if Karol had just had a few Viagra handy, none of his troubles would have begun. But then I thought about Dominique's essential characteristics, and I think that Karol would be better off with somebody new. I don't see a future for them.  ---  --- One of the things I liked a lot about this movie is that it kept me guessing. Was it going to be a romantic comedy, or a black comedy or some kind of excruciatingly dull exploration of sexual inadequacy? Was Karol really just a sad loser when he seemed sort of resourceful in a sad, funny way? What was he trying to do with his property purchase? Where did Dominque fit in or was this just a cameo with Delpy? Was something sad going to happen after I'd figured out it seemed to be a combination black/romantic comedy? I like a movie that I can't quite see the end to.  ---  --- People have said that this movie is the equality part of the trio. I saw this movie as a clever, bittersweet struggle for dominance, not equality, and laced with a little revenge. I thought it was a sweet, bittersweet, clever movie
Popstar would be a great choice for concerned parents wondering what subscription to get for their ten-year-old kid, because unlike many celebrity news magazines (even more teen-oriented ones), Popstar is most likely the safest one out there. It covers a great deal of celebrities that aren't huge yet, and tons of stuff about favorites like Lindsay Lohan, Hilary Duff, Raven, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, the cast of Harry Potter, Good Charlotte, etc. There are thousands of pinups and huge posters in each issue that will satisfy any music/TV/movie fan.  ---  --- Another thing I like about this magazine is that it's legnthy (each issue is 100 pagees), and there aren't any advertisements, either. The magazine has frequent exclusive interviews and pictures with celebrities that can't be found anywhere else. Additionally, Popstar covers the month's best CDs, new artists to watch out for, embarrasing moments stories, horoscopes, a bit of fashion and beauty, and more. For those who want an interesting, informational celeb magazine, Popstar would be a great choice
The scent is so unforgettable, fresh and sexy and sweet and... it's just the best among the best
I read the review saying Simple Start didn't have enough features and would lead to upgrading to get a usable version. Despite the warning, I thought I could get away with Simple Start because I was buying the program for bookkeeping at a tiny church and would be putting few demands on the program. Even for my simple needs, it was a bust I had to upgrade to Pro for an additional $100. If Quicken isn't enough for your needs, get Pro.
I have tried EVERYTHING for our francis francis espresso machine, and had an extremely difficult time to make it taste wonderful. --- I found this espresso, and the first time I tried it, I was absolutely HOOKED.  Try it; you'll love it! 
This is a great CD!  Each track fades up to full volume at the start and fades down to silence at the end.  This makes it nice to just play the entire CD or to loop one track since there are no sharp changes from one noise to another.  So far the Car and Washing machine tracks seem to be our baby's favorites.  When she outgrows the need for this white noise CD, we'll transition her to lullaby or classical music.  For now though, this CD helps us keep her on a schedule and well rested by helping keep her relaxed and usually asleep during her nap times.  As a bonus, the Waves and Rain on the Roof tracks are soothing for grown-ups needing to drown out noise while they sleep
The cookies are great. We've been eating them for about 7 years. Cannot find them in our local stores all the time. Thank
I bought this watch for my bf on V-Day, I ordered it on 2/10 and the order was here online, fast shipping and item was in good shape. Will do business again in the future.
I've tried the Andy Capp HOT FRIES, REG CHEDDAR, and WHITE CHEDDAR. These HOT FRIES are the best. They're the best of the 3 products and best all on their own! I'm getting addicted to them (ordered a second carton before finishing the first). Definitely nicely HOT -- that's part of the addictive quality. And an enjoyable to eat with the good underlying corn flavor and non-greasy crispness that I like about the Andy Capp products
Hayley Westenra, at only 18 years old, is an enchanting voice we should be hearing from for many years to come. This is an uplifting and at times, spiritual album that shows shades of greatness. Throughout, Westenra's voice is captivating, though the musical scores are at times, sub-par and do not equal the vocal talent.  ---  --- There was an advertising tag on this CD that stated "The female Josh Grobin", but I think a more accurate sentiment would be "a young Sarah Brightman". ODYSSEY is a fine mix of spiritual and operatic tunes, all of which match up well with Westenra's abilities. Bocelli fans will also appreciate the duet, Dell Amore Non Si Sa. They pair up for that one song, but the rest is all Westenra.  ---  --- This is smooth, soothing and easy listening. If you like Brightman, you will truly appreciate the voice of Westenra. 
This is like a real fish the the tub. Our little one loves it
I flip through Time every now and again at the barber shop.  Sometimes there are good bits that they are using to keep the interest of people who want progressive social change, people who are sick of the power of the corporate elite and the violence of our militarists.   --- For the most part, since Time receives most of its revenues from Big Business advertisements, it can't challenge the establishment as it needs to. --- So instead I read magazines like Z, Utne, Mother Jones, The Progressive, The Sun, Earth Island and the New Internationalist
I loved it, the movie arrived so quickly it was awesome.  It has brought back a lot of memories from my past.  Thank you
After reading the other reviews, I had to speak up.  I've tried it all: the garage bump, the stop light type system, etc.  You mount this unit on the ceiling and point it to a specific point on your car so you know where to stop.  In my case, I point it at the dash.  When I enter the garage, the laser turns on and because the laser is very bright, you can follow it as it tracks along your hood.  If you set it up right, this helps you set the distance between your cars or the side garage wall. For example, you can set it to run only the seam of your hood or the middle crease if you have one. Then when it reachs the dash, I watch for it to land in a specific area and stop.  A successful park, usually with only an inch or two variance.  It so rocks
I,ve seen complaints about the ac adapter you "must" plug in. Hey guys, try it without an outside energy source, I just hope I,m not gonna fry something but it seems to work fine just plugged into a powered USB port. I have a VERY high end system though with wattage to sprare, but no more PCI slots, Damn 7900 512 gtx graphics cards, why do 2 of em have to take up so much room. Oh well, trade offs are a bi---, but a reality and 7 extra USB slots are awfully nice
we received it with broken cover. It didn't work properly and stopped running every hour. We tried different ways to make it run, but nothing worked. We've returned it. It's just waste of money. --- On the other hand the COW-humidifier which we bought at the same time is fine and running well. No complaints
THIS GUITAR IS ONE OF A KIND THE COLOR IS WONDERFUL !!!! WHEN I SAW THIS GUITAR I WANTED IT REALLY BAD BUT I DIDNT KNOW HOW TO PLAY !! SO I ASKED MY FRIEND BECUASE SHE KNOWS HOE TO PLAY !!! NOW I'M TRYING TO SAVE UP AND BUY THIS GUITAR YOU SHOULD BUY IY TOO !!!!
This gun shoots fast, hard, and accurate. Plus all the extras you get with it are just awesome
I got this net and set it up in February and been using it fairly regularly. I was hitting some balls tonight and noticed some tears in the netting much to my disappointment!  ---  --- Shouldn't a $100.00 golf net last longer than 3-4 months? ---  --- Completely unacceptable
 --- Mistral, as many know, is a powerful, gusty wind that blows across the south of France. Mistral, as I was happy to discover, is also the name of a line of bath and body products, all French inspired, all lusciously lovely from scented soaps to soothing lotions to rejuvenating body butters.  ---  --- Matthew Tilker, founder and president of Mistral, utilizes Shea butter, which is an efficacious natural healer, in a myriad of must-have forms. Derived from the nuts of the African Shea Tree (according to sacred custom the nuts are harvested primarily by women), this butter is highly emollient, a boon for those with dry skin, chapped lips, any number of skin irritations.  ---  --- The pure Shea Butter soap comes in a plethora of inviting fragrances, all milled six times (while others boast being triple milled). South Seas is a particular favorite - it's as fresh as an ocean breeze and as calming, soothing as a tropical island. The marine scent is accented with a touch of grapefruit, white flowers and soft woods. An irresistible combination.  ---  --- South Seas is a fragrance with which you wish to surround yourself - made possible by the shower gel, body lotion, massage bath and body oil, bath salts and candle all available at very accessible prices.  ---  ---      - Gail Cooke
[...]The mouse is larger than needed and lighter than the average mouse.  I have dual screens and need an extra accurate mouse.  This is NOT it.  Unfortunately with this one, the sensor doesn't stand still.  My screensaver hardly ever turns on because when the mouse is just sitting there, the arrow jumps in all directions about 2-3 arrow spaces around.  Don't be fulled by the laser technology in this particular mouse.  My old optical was better. 
While I think the basics of the book are good, I don't like how fat-free items are treated as always being the best option.  I did much better on the South Beach Diet, where good fats in moderation is emphasized as well as natural foods.  Fat is what makes us feel satisfied.  After years of trying to diet by limiting fat, it was a revelation to me I could lose weight without feeling hungry and deprived.  An omelette made of egg whites and fat-free cheese is not at all satisfying and not necessary.  Secondly, many foods are altered in a negative way to make them low-fat.  I just noticed this week that Cool Whip lite has high fructose corn syrup and hydrogenated vegetable oil as two of it's top ingredients.  This can't be better for you than actual cream.  I also prefer the book "French Woman Don't Get Fat", which emphasizes enjoying food by eating smaller portions of good, natural food when it's in season.  The pleasure of good food makes you stop thinking diet and start thinking about lifestyle.  I feel that the G.I Diet is oversimplified and written to appeal to an audience that has never thought about eating right before.  I think this book is  about the mechanics of healthy eating when the cause of overeating is a lot more complicated.  It certainly can help get people on the right track, but I think there are better books available. 
Please all this is far from Sam Elliot's better Westerns. See "The Sacketts', "Conagher", "The Shadow Riders", or "The Quick and the Dead". This is far less a believable Western. Few if any women did what this woman did let alone the whole storlyine reeks of trying to be modern, not authentic. Sorry but no character development in my book does not make a good movie. Not to mention these were not exactly the kind of characters I would want to see developed
I bought this bra because the ad says 100% cotton.  There is no cotton in this bra.  It is 86% nylon and 14% elastane.  If you want a cotton bra, this is not for you
I have had this watch for a few months, and so far it has served me well.  It is very solidly built, and has survived a few falls already.  It is accurate enough to get me to work on time.  I do have to wind it about once every week or two, mainly because I don't move my arm enough, I think.  Note that this watch is fairly big (on me anyway) and the strap is quite stiff when new.  It has started to loosen up now that I have had it for a while.  I like the look, and I think it is dressy enough to wear with a suit, but still casual enough that it doesn't look out of place with jeans either.  A reasonable price for a decent watch
Almost unbelievably bad, except I saw the remake of 'Shaft,' which should have been a forewarning.  This is like a comic book for filmgoers.  No, not a graphic novel adapted to the screen.  More like a comic book for kids, that you'd be embarassed to own at any age.  Doubly offensive is the high quality soul music that is on the soundtrack, a travesty to the nth degree.   
This is a great DVD for all collections even if the movie stank which it did not.  The package is worth the coin. --- 
I've been a subscriber of E Magazine (which stands for The Environmental Magazine) for over a year now and I love it. It is, by far, the best environmentally oriented magazine I've come across. All of the ads are for environmentally-friendly companies and products, I now purchase products at at least 50% of the places advertised in this magazine.

I did a lot of searching and review reading on the internet before finally deciding what to buy. I am convinced Quick Draw II is THE best value available of any make by any conpany. The features on the QDII are generally found only on much higher priced detectors. This thing really works as advertised. I have already found several coins and other things right in my own yard. It will reliably indicate what coin is being detected although it many times confuses dimes and pennies on the LCD readout. It is very sensitive and detects most coin size items very reliably to about 6 or 8 inches. The auto notch discrimination works well and filters out most trash items. I have used metal detectors that ended up being aggravating and frustrating. This one is a pleasure to use and is quickly becoming a relaxing and profitable pastime for me. If you want a serious metal detector without spending a whole lot of money give it a try... you won't be disappointed..
I bought my wife a Nuvi 350 for her birthday last August (overall, we love the Nuvi, but the mount...no). The biggest "advantage" of the Nuvi over other GPS systems is its portability. Unfortunately, the suction cup appears to have been designed to subvert this feature. The cup sticks to the first window it is attached to very well...and then won't let go. When we tried to transfer it (after being attached only a couple of days), it left pieces of itself to the windshield and was very difficult to reattach to another windshield (though with difficulty and repeated tries, we have been able to move it).  ---  --- What this means is that you need a mount for each car you want to use this in. The mount and the charging/power wire (which you will also need since it is cumbersome to remove from the mount) are pretty darn expensive ($60-70) which is ridiculous for a "portable" system
I followed the instructions and didn't overuse it. The motor went after 2 months. I miss it so much that I am considering getting another one, even though I never got my money back for the first one
this bra was a terrible waste of money. the wire on one side stabs me constantly. the other side is fine. it's obviously defective.
Poor quality. One of the screw driver is already broken by using 2 times.
My husband is very picky. He LOVES this watch. He has gone through a lot of them and loves that it's dressy yet casual and can wear it anywhere. He loves that it's a substantial weight  and the bracelet came extra long. He's 6'2 and "large boned". Had a watch repair shop take a couple links out for only $5. Great investment
This is a product that is dependent on constant upgrades because the most current version of the 2006 tax forms are often not available when it first comes out.  That is the nature of the product.   ---  --- However, for the third year in a row, many Macintosh users have run into problems with their automated online form upgrade process.  If the automated upgrade process does not work, you can do the upgrade manually, but that is a somewhat complex process.  Alternatively, you can order a snail mail version of the upgraded program, if you can ever get through to the phone number you have to call.  They always seem to be encountering a large volume of calls no matter what time you call.   ---  --- Its a great product once you get it upgraded to contain the most recent version of the forms.  I wonder if the automated upgrade process works for Windows users?  At any rate, until they fix the automated upgrade process, an important part of the software, I have to rate it as low as possible
They totally fell apart after wearing them 2 or 3 times!  I expected more having paid nearly $20 for a pair of slippers.  VERY dissapointed
I've been using Studio for years and while I definitely had reliability problems with Studio 10.0, 10.6 has been very reliable, and beta testing 10.7 shows me it is just getting better.  I tried Premiere Elements but it was much harder to figure out how to do things, and it was much slower burning a simple DVD image, and it simply doesn't do HD which I've started playing with.  I'm sticking with Studio and I make a DVD just about every week with my kids' videos.  I do recommend that you have a good system that is fairly clean
I have used a few different brands of Stevia liquid.  This is defiantly a sub par version as evidenced by the additions of glycerin and water in the product.  I would recommend using a different brand that has neither
totally awesome. my favorite game ever. the sound is revolutionary, the graphics are top notch, it is so real you'll freak. although, the PS2 version has four extra levels and thirty minutes of impressive new dialoge and cinematics, so i would buy the PS2 version if I were you. A must own for every gamer. it will change your life
Great Magazine, ---  --- I use this magazine and go to http://www.buyacarforum.com to learn everything about cars and to buy a new car, try it out, its great
At one time, Southern Living was truly a source in our family for cooking ideas.  Over the past few years, it has become a collection of new things to do with canned and boxed food, in a sad attempt to re-arrange the same old thing for people who do not know how to cook.  Only the Christmas book seems to actually embrace cooking now.  We cannot speak to its information on gardening, just the cooking part.  If it were not my mother's habit of reading Southern Living, we would have cancelled this long ago.  If you are a serious cook, get the cookbooks from years ago.  The current magazine is well beneath you
I did enjoy this book as it was my first introduction to magnet therapy.  This is a topic that I intend to explore much further too.  It was very helpful and gave good information
The Cables To Go 4 port USB PS@ unit works well when you have manual mode on without sscanning on. But I have repeated problems with machines rebooting when the KVM is not switched to that device. The video card goes into some blacked out video mode. The pc has to be shutdown. The box drives the card into some lockup and on display there is a overscan error. The box does not properly simulate a monitor to a booting pc. You must bo the port and watch the reboot. Then card is OK until next reboot unattended. Frustrating. The keyboard and mouse are OK. But with wireless keyboard/mouse combo, the box can not be on auto scan mode. Too many drawbacks
Gillette has a quality control problem with the blades.  This is a recent problem, but it nonetheless has caused me to swithch to Schick disposable razors.  The Gillette problem has to do with the blue strip on the razor face.  The blue strip degrades after only a few shaves, and then it actually leaves a blue residue on your face. 
I was looking forward to receiving this body lotion; however was very disappointed when I opened it and smelled the fragrance. ---  --- It smells exactly like paint.  Then after a few minutes it seems to just disappear with a faint paint-like scent. ---  --- I will not buy any more Philosophy products.  The less expensive fragrances/lotions are so much better that you buy from Target, Wal-Mart, etc
This is my 2nd one. That's just because I dropped the other one on my hard tile a few too many times and was tired of sending it in to get fixed.(it was just the watch face that broke, the watch kept on ticking) All you have to do is read the simple directions on entering your age, weight, sex and hit start during your work out. When you're done you can see your average heart rate during your workout, the length of your workout and the calories burned. There are many other things you can do with it such as set an alarm if your heart rate gets too high/too low, set an alarm to wake you up from your power nap, do lap times, etc
First things first, you will not be treated to that classic 'cooking' smell.    In fact, your appetite is better off not catching a whiff of that magnesium-salt concoction that heats your meal.  Think happy thoughts, and be oblivious. ---  --- Why?  Because the meal itself is actually pretty good (and has an airtight separation with the 'oven').  The package also includes plastic spork, knife, and napkin.  Basically, the ingredients are on-par with what you would typically find in canned stew (and similarly need not be refrigerated).   ---  --- However, the meal loses one star because the serving size is fairly small.  210 calories isn't a whole lot to go on, particularly if you must engage in strenuous physical activity under low-temperature conditions.  ---  --- Pros: lightweight, keeps well, cooks itself, easy disposal, tastes good. ---  --- Cons: cost and storage space per calorie is somewhat high. ---  --- If you were creative, you might be able to figure a way to cook something else using the box oven
These cookies were ok, just ok.  I may have been inclined to give them three stars had they arrived as whole cookies, every last cookies was broken.  I understand this is probably due to poor packaging.  The consistency was a bit grainy and dry though.  And milk did not help.  Next time I'll purchase a chewy brand or Mrs. Fields
These wipes are very rough.  We bought these when our daughter was first born and I ended up not using them on her because she would scream everytime I used them.  If your baby has sensitive skin I would recommend the Huggies Newborn or the Huggies supreme wipes.  Wipe your face with one and you will see how scratchy they are.  Imagine how your baby's bottom feels afterward
Works as advertised, I needed longer range and it provided, easy setup, stable connection
a very, very good book to get to know the everyday life of late imperial Chinese
I purchased this pair of earrings for my 5 year-old granddaughter to wear as the flower girl in my niece's wedding.  When the purchase arrived, they were too small for my granddaughter.  Therefore I had to return them
This is a fine collection for those who have recently discovered early REM as well as those who own REM's previous IRS years video collection: Succumbs.  The Succumbs videos are all here, with some variation, and the additional videos/footage are excellent.  Very serious fans will want more, but this is better than nothing and worth the price. --- If you like early REM then you may like: --- 1) End Of The Day by Reivers --- 2) Banjos And Sunshine by Sixty Acres --- 3) A Life Full Of Farewells by The Apartments --- 4) Massachusetts by Scud Mountain Boys
Thank you for the fast shipping of The Daily Strength books,they will make great gifts- Thanks, Rober
Other parents told us about these, specifically the vanilla scented ones. ---  --- Baby #1 was bottle fed and took to an Advent pacifier right away.  We used the scented soothies whenever we couldn't get a bottle ready fast enough for her likes.  Not sure if it was the shape of the soothie pacifier or the scent, but she always calmed down wihle we'd finish getting the bottle ready. ---  --- Baby #2 was also bottle fed, but did not take to any pacifier right away.  We tried these regular soothies as well as the vanilla ones and the Advent ones too.  She eventually took to the Advent. ---  --- It really is up to each baby what they will like.  But these are definately worth trying.  In addition to the regular and vanilla ones, there are also various sizes, including preemie, pacifiers attached to small stuffed, plush animals that are easier for babies to find and put into their mouth...and also easier for Mom & Dad to in the back of the car, the darkened bedroom, etc
I bought the African-American 2005 Holiday Barbie for my little girl.  I agree with her statement that "She's too pretty to play with!!".  Mattel did an amazing job this year.  The face on this doll is EXQUISITE. "Miss 2005" is absolutely proportionate in classic Barbie terms. The gown's colors definitely put you in a festive spirit.  In fact, the ball gown, as a whole, is supernaturally beautiful.  Picking Bob Mackie as this year's designer was nothing short of GENIUS.  When I saw that Mackie was the HOLIDAY designer, I knew that Mattel had finally gotten it right!
While this book is not a comprehensive volume, it does cover the most common landscape plants in the Virginia landscape. There is a strong emphasis on older varieties of plants and those that are BEST suited to the climate conditions of Virginia. ---  --- For a new resident of Virginia who likes to do amatuer landscaping, this book is indispensible
Far better models for similair price range - dissapointed with the quality of the finish etc etc. works fine though.
I definitely need one in each room. We have one in each of the two bedrooms, the living room and the kitchen. The only room I still see roaches in is the bathroom. I guess I should get one for that room, as well...  ---  --- We definitely used to see big I'm-gonna-eat-your-baby roaches, and I haven't seen one since we put these in. However.... we were just moving in and had been ripping cabinets and flooring out, so they may have only surfaced due to our mild construction--which happened to end right about the time I put these in.  ---  --- Final verdict? Eh, circumstantial evidence says "they seem to work."
Excellent product works as advertised and so simple to use. Product well packaged, arrived earlier than expected and in mint condition. ScanSoft responded with an eMail in a timely fashion acknowledging receipt of my Rebate paperwork and provided a pin number for me to access their site to check on it's progress. But you know Rebates....they take forever! --- PDF Converter 4 is not my only ScanSoft Product. I also use Paperport 10 and am extremely satisfied with that. --- My buying experience has always been positive with Amazon.com vendors, never a problem. --- John Mc Laughlin --- Daytona Beach, Florid
I first bought Chipotle flavor and love that one.  That is my favorite flavor.  The Gouda flavor is much too salty for my taste, so I will not buy this flavor again.  The quality of the popcorn and amount you get in this product is excellent.  I will be trying other flavors in future, just not this one
Jet Li as a contrac killer? Come on! The reason why this movie isn't that famous is because it pretty much sucks. It's just a shootem up bang bang type of movie. No realy kung fu here
Ok, I'll admit, the nail clippers rock.  I have no problem using them, they are sharp, cut evenly and are the perfect width.  That said, throw everything else out.  The bulb syringe is useless, keep the one that you get from the hospital.  Get an ear thermometer, it's a heck of a lot easier.  The spoon...not even going there.  The med dropper isn't easy enough to use.  My suggestion?  Go find a syringe with a cork attachment.  You take the top off the bottle, push the cork attachment into the opening.  To use, flip back the attached lid and put the med syringe into the opening, flip the bottle over and draw the med into the syringe.  This is the best way to do it. 
I am very satisfied with the holster for my motorola phone...I would recommend this holster to anyone who needs one for a work phone that is easy to carry and get to when needed..
This was a horrible product, it was difficult to manuever and control. It did nothing but immediately cause my arms, shoulders and wrists to hurt. I felt absolutely nothing at all in the target area, my stomach. Not even a little. It was boring and pointless to bother.This machine was a waste of time to ship back and forth and I do not recomend it to anyone who wants to work their stomach muscles. Its a misleading product and very uncomfortable on the back also. It hurt my spine to bend in the way they said. I felt the machine digging into my spine. I was so focused on the pain and the pain in my arms I could not continue for more than 5 minutes at a time. Dont waste your time buying this product. Its expensive and not worth it.
Although I did not purchase this product from Amazon.com (...), I absolutely love it.  The GPS locator provided is amazing and better than I thought it was.  It is not one of those GPS that updates your position every 20 seconds or something, but when I zoomed in I could see my current location constantly moving on the map (so it is updating every second)...I have ridden with deputies in my county as part of an internship and the GPS provided to them isn't even this good.  I recommend this software and GPS to anyone
While The Title cut with Joe Public was Bumping most of this Disc is So-So&Formula Driven.without Teddy Riley The Grooves&Vibe aren't as Strong
The magnet is solid, the frame wiggle perfectly to make it clic and fit just like the picture shows.  Lenses are clear and functional.  However, they need to give a bit more space to accomodate larger heads, since it can get snug and this is NOT your usual glasses.  Notice that the frame encircles the head, making head size an issue. ---  --- On the plus side- the glasses won't fall off when you bend forward, they stay around your neck after you unclick 'em, and they are functional
I purchased 5 of the Anvil SS Henleys in assorted colors not long ago.  Out of the box, they were good quality.  After 2 washes, however, they have shrunk drastically to the point that they cannot be tucked in anymore.  My personal opinion... waste of money
Shadowbred by Paul Kemp is simply an excellent book.  The story is incredibly engrossing, the atmosphere set for each scene is really top-notch, and the journey Paul takes his character's through is really incredible. ---  --- We see personal demons and struggles of the heroes.  Struggles with faith, the journey of an anti-hero to a hero and whether he can really make this journey.  The villains are equally deep and interesting and frankly human. ---  --- If you are a fan of fantasy literature, definitely pick this one up - you won't regret it.   ---  --- As a side note, you might want to pick up the previous books by Paul featuring Erevis Cale as well
I appreciate the previous reviews, but we had already gotten the game by the time I read them.  My family - ages 4, 6, 10 and three adults playing  really enjoyed this game. We played until we had a winner (not too long)and then everyone remaining wanted to play to get a second place winner.  Just our opinion - but we had a good time
I have looked at a couple different Hammocks and for the money this was the most comfotable out of all because of the soft  cotton design.  Definetly worth the money I would only suggest selling with or buying a  frame for it
I would give this 5 stars but for a few things: ---  --- - the included earbuds are uncomfortable and fall out of my ears during ---   exercise --- - syncing is sometimes buggy --- - you have to load all podcasts manually --- - podcasts seem to be ordered by date on the player, no matter how you ---   arrange them in iTunes ---  --- Recent releases of iTunes have solved some, but not all, of the sync issues. Also, I have read about some workarounds for the podcast ordering problem, but they involve rebuilding your library, and furthermore from what I've read they're just temporary fixes. Apple needs to fix this. ---  --- Still, the small form factor, cool design, and easy-to-use controls make this a great product. I sold my 4G 40GB iPod right after I got this, and I have no regrets.
With as many big names in this I thought it would be amazing....well, it is a corn ball adventure..its set in ancient times yet one man beats someone up, flies off whips out a pair of modern day sunglasses and puts them on and POSES!! (shakes head) its things like this that REALLY hurt the film for many kung fu/hong kong film fans. I REALLY wanted to like this film but couldn't get past the ridiculousness of it. Now corny can be ok at times but this is just rubbish
I recently purchased this computer for my twin granddaughters who are four.  I have returned them because the screen is too small.  Additionally, I thought it would have a word processor; it does not.  It is game oriented
Rhymefest is an Ok rapper and the first two joints are bumping. Man, I thought I was in for a classic hip hop album , It was like the Lakers were --- ahead by 30 points then all of a sudden the other team caught up and eventually won the game because after that it was just wack track after wack track. I admire his thought provoking lyrics but if the beat ain't hittin I could care less what you're rapping about. Rhymefest used so many R&B singers I thought I was listening to some old New Edition or After 7 joints not that I don't like those singers but I don't want to hear that on no hip hop album. If you want to hear some real Chicago hip hop check out All Natural the best besides Common to ever come from the city of wind
I purchased this for my wife for Valentine's Day. The installation went fine but I have two problems with the device. First, the software to do the picture transfers is awful. You can only select pictures on your computer to download - you can't see what photos are on the device in the software. In order to delete photos you have to do it manually from the device itself. I checked the webpage for updated software - no joy. The crop feature is nice (and well used) but otherwise I feel like I am looking at a Windows 3.1 application. Second, the image quality on the device is very poor. I didn't have very high expectations, but this was lower than I expected. Reminds me of the picture/screen quality in the very first color cell phone screens, maybe a bit worse. You can make out the picture, but not much detail at all. The advice of cropping the photos to only show headshots is an excellent idea, it's the only way to get a decent picture. ---  --- Overall, I'm a little disapointed. But then, you get what you pay for..

Does not cut hair cleanly.  Ends up pulling at hair and requires multiple passes
Avatar is one of my favorite shows. I am so thrilled that it is on Amazon. At first, the episode I downloaded didn't work, but they fixed the bugs. I have it on my Creative Zen Vision:M and it looks great
With the texture of an aloe vera gel, this Hibiscus Enriched Aqua-Collagen-Gel smoothes over the skin effortlessly and penetrates the skin to create some stunning results. Not only will your complexion improve, your skin will firm and tighten to reveal a renewed tone.  ---  --- The secrets in this formulation include Hibiscus flower extract, Hibiscus fruit extract, Citrus Junos Peel Oil, Bergamot Fruit Oil, Orange Oil, Collagen and Allantoin. This gel is perfect alone if your skin is combination to oily or can be used along with another moisturizer if your skin is dry. The ingredients seem to balance and soothe the skin and also encourage an anti-aging effect.  ---  --- The firming and toning of the skin is truly amazing. This is one product you won't want to live without and you can alternate the various Dr. Ci:Labo Collagen Gels to gain the full benefits of each.  ---  --- The Super Moisture Moisturizer is also perfect in the driest of winters and would seem to be essential when living in desert conditions. The Super Moisturizer contains Hyaluronic Acid, Aloe, Lobata Root Extract, Flower Extracts, Grape Leave Extract, Sea Salt and Horse Chestnut.  ---  --- ~The Rebecca Review 
of every band/group, there is always the weak link, Tony Yayo proves that he is the one with Thoughts Of A Predicate Felon.  Many of the songs are not produced by Dr. Dre (one of the few things that G-Unit has going for them) resulting in "greasy" and bad beats.  Tony Yayo cant seem to trun his mouth away from drug trafficing, being locked up in prison, hoes, ect.  He lyrics aren't all that great either, making him have the worst voice in G-unit as well.  He sounds almost as if he is my grandfather- maybe as a result of getting locked up.  The few pluses on the album are "Drama Setter" feat. Eminem and Obie Trice followed by Eminem's constant adreniline rushing sound and beats (even though he only is apart of the chorus-a big mistake) as well as "G-S**t".  My advice, download these two songs- this CD isn't worth $14.00
I bougt this camera because I had had a Sony Coolpix 3, which took great pictures.  With this camera, you can never get it adjusted right.  If you use the flash the  pictures are to light, if you dont they are too dark.  It is a constant battle with this little cute camera. Worse camera purchase I ever made.
This is a great idea: a small CD player to match the rest of the Tivoli line. Unfortunately, the quality of the units I tried came nowhere near the quality of the rest of the Tivoli line. All in all, Tivoli sent me four of these units and each had problems: one wouldn't play the disc, one wouldn't eject the disc, one had an LED readout that would go blank, and one had variations on all of these problems. The Model One is a great product and the PAL and the others are close behind, but the Model CD needs a lot more work
This book refers to philosophical basis of Buddhist practices as well as technical clasification of the states to be reached into meditative absortion. It is not a manual nor a guide. No Meditation techniques nor yoga excersises can be found on the book. the style is simbolic and poetical. it is an interesting book but the name does not reflect the content. It will be interesting for people more inclined to scholarly work
When I first saw the previews, I thought that it looked very interesting and could be a good movie...of course, I thought the same about White Noise.  I guess the lesson here is that Hollywood has trouble making a good movie from beginning to end (like The Sixth Sense).  I think Hollywood is more interested in making a good TRAILER than they are a good movie so they can make a lot of money in the box office.  The Forgotten is no exception.  The first half an hour or so is very good and Joseph Ruben creates a creepy atmosphere with good performances from Julianne Moore and Dominic West.  However, the movie quickly begins to fall apart (like White Noise) and becomes less and less believable.  I was hoping for a logical explanation, especially since the box of the movie read: "The biggest jaw-dropper since The Sixth Sense."  However, the explanation is flimsy and unrealistic and my jaw only dropped at how ridiculous it was.  Nothing at all like when the ending came for Sixth Sense.  I bought this movie for $2 so I can't complain but so much, but am still amazed at Hollywood still struggles to make an entertaining, cohesive movie without so many holes.  The only thing that is "forgotten" is I have forgotten when creepy, psychological movies were good
I like to eat avocados, I like avocado face masks, and now I can bathe in eau de avocado!  This bath bomb is possibly my favorite - very softening, great color (turns your tub into a nice green lagoon), and great lemony scent.  I didn't find the glitter to be very noticeable, so don't worry about that.  Stock up on this one
The Star Trek Collection is a worthy hobby and certainly the largest of the television series DVD Collections (The Original Series, The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, Voyager and Enterprise). At around 1100 minutes per box (a few hours less than the TOS seasons) we are still looking at approx 30 boxes with 700 hours of viewing. That is 1 month of non-stop Star Trek. No DVD series comes remotely close to that. Get going collecting right now and build up on each succession over the years. By the end you will have a very serious anthology that defines the word awe. This is the kind of item that requires 1 hour a day of your time for the next few years. It is a cherished memory that served your fathers and will serve your children also. Our very planet, Earth, has advanced because of Gene Roddenberry's admirable concept. Roddenberry nailed the premise of the series when he said that he wanted to create a show with characters that we could look up too. `The Bridge' members are like our family. Watch what they do. Then go and spend your life striving for the same on Earth. What engineer, medic, scientist, teacher, worker can not say that Star Trek has not influenced them? The show is this significant in the development of our species. Even Christians respect and quote its authority and it is not hard to see why. The DVD case is not quite as fancy as the TOS (The Original Series) cases. The TNG case is supposed to resemble a TNG crew briefcase. The case opens to reveal the disc booklet inside a sleeve. Sliding the disc booklet out of the sleeve and flipping it open reveals a spread of 7 discs. There are 4 episodes per disc. However the last disc, disc 7, only has two episodes, for a grand total of 26 episodes (TOS has 8 Discs, 30 episodes). The rest of disc 7 is devoted to Star Trek interviews and trailers with the usual expected extras...and then some more. The episodes are ordered not in the sequence they where filmed, but in the sequence that they aired, however each episode has been numbered according to the order they where filmed in. This means on one disc you have shows 4, 2, 12 and 1, in that order. The sound has also been remastered to 5:1 Dolby Digital! Since the show was shot in full frame, these dimensions are retained. ---  --- Star Trek, The Next Generation (TNG), Season One, had an amazing impact when it was first broadcast. An instant hit and a milestone in television serials (it ran for 7 seasons unlike its predecessor that ran for 3), its characters and new look Enterprise had us glued to the TV with the first computer generated images of our solar system as Captain Picard utters the immortal words... `To baldly'... I mean... `To boldly go where no man'... I mean... `To boldly go where no one has gone before.' Viewing the episodes in the order they where filmed does not show a vision in the shaping as per the TOS series but is more of the same again (even remaking some TOS episodes), this time with more characters, more action and more special effects.  ---  --- SEASON 1 --- All of the main characters in the TNG series are in episode one, Captain Jean-Luc Picard,  Commander William T. Riker,  Lieutenant/Lt. Commander Geordi La Forge, Lieutenant Tasha Yar, Lieutenant Worf, Commander Dr. Beverly Crusher, Lt. Commander/Commander Deanna Troi, Lt. Commander Data and Ensign Wesley Crusher.  Only Natasha Yar quits before the first season is finished. Commander Dr. Beverly Crusher is replaced by Doctor Katherine Pulaski for Season two. Ensign Wesley Crusher is only sometimes reoccurring after Season four. The Enterprise itself is beautifully rendered with additional areas such as the holodeck allowing for almost any environment at the users choosing, playing an important function in many episodes. The use of computer generated images (a ground-breaking television experience back in 1987!) allowed for inspirational subspace sequences, planets, backdrops, an improved bridge main viewer and windows! Advances in makeup effects brought new alien characters to life and allowed an actor to appear as if he where indeed an android. TNG Season One attempts to relate with TOS by reviving similar stories while at the same time adding on additional insights into new and fascinating sci-fi theory while retaining most of the character arcs that made TOS so interesting. The stories (also written by TOS's DC Fontana) are as fresh today as they where in the late 80s, early 90s, when TNG first aired. Season One of TNG is mostly about deities, infections, alien cultures, galactic politics, time travel, alien forces, mind control, family matters, computer malfunctions and Starfleet Academy. There are also the unforgettable episodes `Encounter at Farpoint' which introduces us to the crew of the Enterprise and the mysterious Q,  `Where No One has Gone Before' a wonderful story about travelling the cosmos, `Datalore' which features two Data characters, `Heart of Glory' with some in-depth revelations about Klingons , `Skin of Evil' featuring some remarkable effects for its time with a very sad ending, and the classic `Conspiracy' (this episode is uncut, which features some violent scenes involving a head explosion edited from some daytime television showings [so parents be cautious]) about an invasion of the body snatchers type takeover of Starfleet. The bottom line for TNG: Season One is that it will bring back some enormously delightful memories for those who where awe inspired by it when it first came out. Although we can debate about which is the better series, TNG or TOS, we still absolutely adore both. We might miss Kirk rolling about the desert scrub with a seven foot man in a rubber reptile costume, but hearing Picard saying `make it so' just makes our day. ---  --- SEASON 2 --- Season Two, still carries on with repeating much of the stories in TOS, revamping them and then adding some new stuff of its own, boosting Data's screen time, bumping up the computer generated graphics to allow for things like shuttlecraft launching and manoeuvres, improved alien CGI and an enhancement in particle effects. They even attempt a type of morphing. Most of the main characters from Season One are here, Captain Jean-Luc Picard, Commander William T. Riker (now with a beard), Lieutenant Commander Geordi La Forge, Lieutenant Commander Worf (letting his hair grow), Commander Deanna Troi (complete with low-cut red starfleet costume), Lt. Commander Data and Ensign Wesley Crusher. However obviously Commander Lieutenant Tasha Yar is gone but so is Dr. Beverly Crusher (who was not bad-looking), replaced by Doctor Katherine Pulaski (who looks like your granny!) for Season Two because Dr. Crusher has been reassigned to Starfleet Medical as explained in episode one of Season Three (in reality the TNG writers where having difficulties in developing Crusher's character, would later reinstate her for Season Three, dropping Pulaski because they felt her character was not working). Colm Meaney as Miles Edward O'Brien, Navigation from Season One gets more screentime, while the new Whoopi Goldberg chatacter, Guinan, is the wise El Aurian bartender in 10 Forward, the new bar room where the Enterprise crew get to relax. Except for this extra area the Enterprise itself has not gone undergone much of a revamp and this season is far more Enterprise based than Season One, or all of TOS, meaning Season Two has less planetary exploration stories which is a bit of a drawback, but sets a new standards in the `hotel in space' feel that would produce the `Deep Space Nine' series. Season Two of TNG is mostly about alien impregnation, mystery space, AI, the holodeck, interplanetary relations, rapid aging, justice, shape-shifting, time travel, family, the prime directive, kidnapping, cloning, war games and infections. The big plus side to not having that much planetary exploration is that there are lots of stories with Klingons and the first encounter with the BORG! The unforgettable episodes are, `Elementary, Dear Data' where Data takes on his Sherlock Holmes persona and we are introduced to the Moriarty character. `Loud as a Whisper' is about a deaf and dumb peace negotiator. `A Matter of Honor' is where Riker serves on a Klingon battleship. `Q Who?' may well be the best episode here because it is the first time we meet the Borg. The last episode of Season Two `Shades of Gray' may be one of the worst Star Trek episodes ever, which uses Riker's memories from Seasons One and Two to make up an entire episode and even includes the uncut scenes for the Season One episode `Conspiracy' featuring the violent head explosion edited from some daytime television showings [so parents be cautious again]). The bottom line for TNG: Season Two is that for all it shortcomings because of lack of beaming down, we get the Borg and lots and lots of Klingons. At this stage in the saga we might still miss Kirk rolling about the desert scrub with a seven foot man in a rubber reptile costume, but how will Picard defeat those assimilating half-man, half-machine entities that are heading his way? He better "make it so" with Season Three. ---  --- SEASON 3 --- It was the dawn of the 90s and since CGI had undergone some development, the improvements can be seen not only in the new opening sequence, but with better looking planets (complete with moving gaseous atmospheres) and major enhancements in particle effects. Towards the end it undergoes new model development, lighting and subspace effects of a movie budget look. The crew uniform has changed with a new type of collar. Most of the main characters from Season Two are here, Captain Jean-Luc Picard, Commander William T. Riker (now with a bigger belly), Lieutenant Commander Geordi La Forge, Lieutenant Commander Worf (letting his hair grow even more), Commander Deanna Troi (with more makeup, costume changes and even an aerobics outfit [that really isn't as good as it sounds]), Lieutenant Commander Data and Ensign Wesley Crusher (new hairdo). Dr. Beverly Crusher is back (initially with a terrible hairdo that gets better) and Doctor Katherine Pulaski has been dropped from the show never to reappear again. Pulaski's disappearance is not officially explained (in reality Diana Muldaur was told her character was not working and she was offered a role in L.A. Law instead. McFadden was asked to rejoin the series again) the crew do act like she has just left because her time was up with Dr. Crusher making reference to Pulaski's work in Episode four. Commander Lieutenant Tasha Yar makes a surprise guest appearance for one episode! Dwight Schultz (Murdoch from the A-Team) makes his first appearance as Lieutenant `Reg' Barkley, who would have a reoccurring role. Colm Meaney is here again as Miles Edward O'Brien, Navigation, doesn't have much of a role boost since Season Two, while the Whoopi Goldberg's Guinan character of the wise El Aurian, the bartender in 10 Forward, has her background further developed. Season Three of TNG is mostly about nanotechnology, colonization, super aliens, the prime directive, orphans, ancient space booby traps, Romulans, wormholes, peace negotiations, defectors, super humans, terrorism, Q, court inquisitions, parallel universes, AI, Klingon high councils, captivity experiments, time travellers, biological space crafts, morale, the first law of robotics, Vulcans, Sarek, evolutionary speciation, and the Borg. Unlike Season Two there is much more planetary exploration and lots of alien encounters. There are loads of unforgettable episodes in this Season, "Evolution" where nanotechnology takes over the Enterprise, "The Survivors" is a mystery about a single household that is the only structure to survive an alien invasion on a whole planet, "Who Watches The Watchers?" is about the prime directive failing when the Enterprise team are spotted and kidnapped, "Offspring" sees Data creating another sentient android, "Sins of the Father" has Worf return to his Klingon homeworld to defend his family honour, "Hollow Pursuits" has Lt. Barkley fantasizing about crew members in the Holodeck, "Sarek" is about the Vulcan of the same name from Star Trek: The Original Series, who is back for what looks like his final peace negotiation, and of course the pot-boiler end episode of "The Best of Both Worlds, Part I" (widely acclaimed as one of the best Star Trek episodes ever!) marks the grand entrance of Locutus of Borg onto the scene. The bottom line for TNG: Season Three is that it is often cited by fans as the best TNG Season and is probably the first of the Seasons to really be worth the price tag demanded of these very expensive box sets. In Season Three everyone seems to have matured, included the writers who are giving us exactly what we want and the series has a serious enough budget to make every episode look like a movie, especially towards the end. There is lots in this season to enjoy and of course not since J.R. Ewing had been shot did we get the kind of cliff-hanger episode that "The Best of Both Worlds, Part I" would deliver on, meaning every Trekie (and who wasn't at this time) across the planet from LA to Hong Kong had to wait all summer to learn how Picard could be saved. There is no time to loose!!! Onto Season Four. .... wooosshhhh. ---  --- SEASON 4 --- Not since J.R. Ewing had been shot did we get the kind of cliff-hanger episode that "The Best of Both Worlds, Part I" would deliver on at the end of Season III, meaning every Trekie (and who wasn't at this time) across the planet from LA to Hong Kong had to wait all summer to learn how Picard could be saved. There was no time to lose!!! Onto Season Four. .... wooosshhhh... so here we are. With Season Three it was the dawn of the 90s and CGI had undergone some development and improvements (better looking planets with moving gaseous atmospheres, particle effects, lighting and subspace effects). With Season Three things started to have more of a movie budget look. Season Four tries to maintain that class. Most of the main characters from Season Two are here, Captain Jean-Luc Picard, Commander William T. Riker, Lieutenant Commander Geordi La Forge, Lieutenant Commander Worf (who keeps growing that hair), Commander Deanna Troi, Lieutenant Commander Data, Dr. Beverly Crusher and Ensign Wesley Crusher (now a Starfleet officer with full uniform, also departs from TNG half way through this Season, and has a recurring role instead of a main character in the remaining three seasons). Colm Meaney is here again as Miles Edward O'Brien and Whoopi Goldberg's Guinan. Lots of characters who had small episode roles are back for Season Four such as Worf's lover K'Ehleyr, the Traveller, K'Mpec the Klingon leader, Duras whose dishonesty caused Worf's discommendation and the Romulan Tomalak. There is also a surprise character at the end of this season. Season Four of TNG is mostly about the Borg, family, Dr. Soong and the AI emotion chip, adoption, the space-time continuum, hostage rescue, the Klingon High Council, Romulans, alternative universes, holographic projection, survival,  loosing special abilities, renegade captains, the devil, amnesia, first contact, love, nightmares, mutations, super intelligence, Robin Hood, witch hunt trials, euthanasia, host life forms, mind control and honour. Like Season Three most the episodes in Season Four have great stories, combining both planetary exploration and the life of the crew instead of dealing with either one or the other as the initial seasons did. It is a well balanced season overall and a good deal more exciting than maybe its three previous seasons now that things are firmly established. Apart from containing Part II of `The Best of Both Worlds', the introduction of the Cardassians, who would become major players in the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine franchise, makes it even more valuable. There are loads of unforgettable episodes in this Season, `The Best of Both Worlds, Part II' concludes the cliff-hanger from Season Three with some great battle special effects, `Family' has Picard going home to see his brother and family, `Brothers' features Dr. Soong who is Data's creator, `Reunion' returns to the story of Worf and his Klingon dishonour, `The Wounded' features the Cardassians for the first time, `Clues' has Data disobeying Picard, `First Contact' sees Riker exposed as an alien on a planet he is monitoring, the `The Nth Degree' has Barclay taking control of the Enterprise with his new special powers of intelligence, `QPid' for its historical recreation of Robin Hood and of course `Redemption, Part I' which deals with Worf's dishonour. The bottom line for TNG: Season Four is that it keeps up the pace of Season Three, and is worth the price tag demanded of these very expensive box sets. Everyone has matured and the writers are giving us exactly what we want. Although not quite the cliff-hanger end episode that "The Best of Both Worlds, Part I" was, `Redemption, Part I' still concerns the loss of a main character to the other side and introduces the surprise return of a person we know. We are left asking ourselves, if the `hard man' is really gone and why does `she' look like a Romulian! As Picard would say "I can live with a mystery" but we just can't! Onto Season Five as quick as we can... ---  --- SEASON 5 --- Season 5 has a remarkable improvement in visual effects. The display panels on the enterprise are more interactive. The camera can now pan as special effects take place. Deep space battles seem more intense. We also get a new Star Trek title graphic in the opening sequence. The cliff-hanger conclusion of "Redemption, Part II" is a great episode although slightly lacking in the promise of a civil war battle between Klingons, Romulans and the Federation, turns out to be more of a character episode than the big epic battler we thought we would get. None-the-less, it is still a good episode that reveals some things about the family of Tasha Yar. Most of the main characters from Season Two are here, Captain Jean-Luc Picard (with a new red suede coat and grey uniform), Commander William T. Riker, Lieutenant Commander Geordi La Forge (who sports a new beard in one episode), Lieutenant Commander Worf (who left the Enterprise in Season Four), Commander Deanna Troi, Lieutenant Commander Data and Dr. Beverly Crusher. Ensign Wesley Crusher (who departed from Season Four half way and has a recurring role instead of a main character in the remaining three seasons) returns for some episodes but is mainly replaced by the new Ensign Ro Laren, a Bajoran. Colm Meaney is here again as Miles Edward O'Brien as is Whoopi Goldberg's Guinan. Alexander Rozhenko as Worf's son now has a reoccurring role since Season Four. Keiko O'Brien, (Miles O'Brien's wife) is firmly established as a reoccurring character. Watch out for the special appearances of Ashley Judd as Ensign Robin Lefler and Leonard Nimoy as Spock! Whoot! Whoot! Strangely enough this is the only season where Q, of the omnipotent Q Continuum, does not make an appearance. Lieutenant Reginald Barclay, engineer is also absent from this Season. Season Four of TNG is mostly about the Klingon High Council, Romulans, communication, Bajora, crystalline entities, disasters, addiction, reunification, time travel, parenting, telekinesis, eugenics, amnesia, possession, euthanasia, sexual repression, time warps, children, cover-ups, sexual attraction, imaginary friends, Borg, invisibility, alternative lives and phase shifting. Like Season Four most the episodes in Season Five have great stories, a perfect balance of planetary exploration and the life of the crew. It much more of the same as in Season Four with the better episodes being `Redemption, Part II', `Darmok' an interesting episode about language, the introduction of the Bajora and Ensign Ro, the Silicon Avatar makes a return, `Unification', Part I and II (both here) with Spock may be one of the most popular double episodes in the whole TNG franchise, certainly more popular than `Time's Arrow', Part I which ends this season with the possibility of something strange happening to Data on Earth. `The Masterpiece Society' shows what happens when a special genetically engineered race has contact from the outside world. Huge of Borg also makes his first appearance in `I, Borg'. Apart from the `Unification' double episode, the instalments `Ethics', about Worf undergoing a major controversial surgical operation and `The Game', when entertainment becomes mind control, have both achieved cult status as some of the best TNG episodes ever aired. Season Five unfortunately has some dull episodes too, many of which occur in the second half of the season, so the best stuff is within the first four discs. It doesn't really create much drive to push for a quick follow up with Season Six, but no doubt because Six is as good as Five was, then we are there for it. As a note: "Redemption part II" - this episode received as 12 age rating in the UK, because it contains Klingon ritual head butting. `Violations' also has sexually violent content (psychic rape). Parents may want to be cautious and view those two episodes before showing it to children. If you are going to move onto Season Six then you will probably want to know that during Season Six the crew make contact with Deep Space Nine. So if you get Deep Space Nice: Season One you can sync up the star dates and watch both franchises in chronological order. If you are in for Six you may also be in for Season One of DS9! ---  --- SEASON 6 --- Season 6 is generally considered the pinnacle of the series for the wind down to the Season 7 conclusion and of course the wake of popularity that Star Trek, Deep Space Nine: Season 1 whipped up while Season 6 was running. 1993 was TV Sci-Fi heaven with fans getting a double dose of ST for the year. This means for the folks who have been watching TOS and TNG, now is the time to do a special chronological order of star dates alternating between TNG Season 6 and DS9 Season 1. You can find the order if you search the new for it. TNG has really good stories while DS9 gets the effects. We are no longer happy to see a new interactive flat panel as the driving force of a story. Season 6 answers with substance to characters and stories with some surprises (Picard acting like a Russian is hysterical. Would you sacrifice his authority role for that quality humour from him from time to time? Maybe yes!). The conclusion of "Time's Arrow" is not the best cliff-hanger but sufficient. Most of the main characters from Season Two are here, Captain Jean-Luc Picard, Commander William T. Riker, Lieutenant Commander Geordi La Forge, Lieutenant Commander Worf, Commander Deanna Troi, Lieutenant Commander Data and Dr. Beverly Crusher. Ensign Wesley Crusher (who departed from Season Four half way and has a recurring role instead of a main character in the remaining seasons) returns for some episodes but is mainly replaced by the new Ensign Ro Laren, a Bajoran. Colm Meaney is here again as Miles Edward O'Brien but will be transferred to DS9 (his absence is not mentioned). Whoopi Goldberg's Guinan is back along with Alexander Rozhenko. Keiko O'Brien, (Miles O'Brien's wife) will also leave for DS9. Lieutenant Reginald Barclay, engineer is back after being absent from Season 5. Season 6 of TNG is mostly about transporter psychosis, empaths, Scotty!, alien abductions, Q, age regression, android dreams, artificial life, Cardassians, Prof. Moriarty, love, Romulan defection, destiny, Klingon birthrights, thieves, command ethics, origins of life, insanity, murder, faith, doubles, time travel and the Borg. Like Season 5 most the episodes in Season 6 have above average sci-fi stories, combing planetary exploration and the life of the crew. Memorable episodes include, A Fistful of Datas, The Quality of Life, Ship in a Bottle, Face of the Enemy, Birthright and lessons. There are three very good episodes which really make the season worth. Tapestry sees Picard given the opportunity to relive his youth without the night he fought with a gang who stabbed him through the heart. Suspicion is a great whodunit episode (of which there are a few) with one of the coolest Star Trek aliens ever (should have made him a main character). Descent Part I is a very nice slight of hand trick. You will keep thinking Hugh right up until the last second. ---  --- SEASON 7 --- Star Trek: Season 7 is of course winding down to a conclusion, making way for some Star Trek films, but in reality it is Deep Space Nine: Season 2 (DS9: Season 1 starts in star date chronological order with TNG: Season 6) that is the new trek. Fans of Star Trek got their twofold measure of these series through 1993 and 1994 making it an exceptional SF TV era. The conclusion of "Descent, Part II" has the finale of Lore. Most of the main characters from Season Two are here, Captain Jean-Luc Picard, Commander William T. Riker, Lieutenant Commander Geordi La Forge, Lieutenant Commander Worf, Commander Deanna Troi, Lieutenant Commander Data and Dr. Beverly Crusher. Ensign Wesley Crusher (who departed from Season Four half way and has a recurring role instead of a main character in the remaining seasons) returns for one episode. While Ensign Ro Laren, a Bajoran, was supposed to replace him, she only appears in one episode in Season 7, although the episode is a major one focused on her. Colm Meaney shows up again as Miles Edward O'Brien for the last episode. Whoopi Goldberg's Guinan is gone without explanation (see the movie "Star Trek: Nemesis" on her). Alexander Rozhenko is back. Keiko O'Brien, (Miles O'Brien's wife) is not here either (after leaving for DS9). Lieutenant Reginald Barclay, engineer, is back again. Season 6 of TNG is mostly about Lore, emotional studies, interfaces, mercenaries, nightmares, psychic trauma, Beverly and Picard, warp travel environmental damage, data's mother, alternate realities, the Pegasus, Worf's human brother, incubus, top secret missions, radiation sickness, deities, Troi and Worf, reverse evolution, Wesley and the Traveller, Klingon right of ascension, Picard's son, abiogenesis, Ro Laren and time travel. While there are some hit and miss episodes and a really terrible one ("Masks" for example is one of the worst of the entire franchise) most are well above average and some are incredible. Memorable episodes include, Gambit, Forces of Nature, Inheritance, Lower Decks, Thine Own Self, Journey's end and Bloodlines. The Pegasus is probably the best episode of the Season, but the finale "All good things..." is really where it is at with some good aging effects, a possible future with an older looking cast and an futuristic Enterprise to die for. The series ends very warmly and with a nicer note about the possibilities of looking within instead of charting stars and galaxies for a newer greater trek. In short there is nothing like ST:TNG. It evolved TV serials into mega media and ran for a full span of 7 years. It set a new benchmark and placed the bar as high as the stars. All we can say about this awe-inspiring series can be summed up in one word...  ---  --- ...AMEN. 
It's a very durable bag. I run trails a lot and I was looking for something to carry my running items during the winter season, durable as well as comfortable, and cheap so I don't have to worry about ripping it. The straps are padded and feel really secure on my shoulders. The part that lays across your back is nicely padded and has already saved me on some nasty spills. And if you need it for books, the padding will keep the books from poking your back. I would imagine it would be a bit hot on your back in the summer though.   --- I expect I will tear it to shreds eventually, but for the price it's worth it.
I bought this 2 years back and still it is in great shape. Recently i forgot compact flash in my shirt pocket and went for washing and then followed by Drying. My wife found compact flash in dryer and i thought it would not work. Surprisingly it is working fine and i could see my past snapshots with out any problem.
great product, easy to use and simple to follow instruction, keeps me in the zone to burn calories while on my walks.  i recommend it to anyone.    it doesnt interface with gym exercise equipment but i dont use them anyway and it doesnt cost 3 to 4 times what one of those do.  buy it, wear it, be happy
     I read previous reviews about not being able to run the program because the computer recognized it as a copied disk. I thought this couldn't possibly happen on my high tech computer... I WAS WRONG... Even though I purchased a legitamate copy, the program still would not let me run it.... BUYER BEWARE!!!!!
This program is positively wonderful for word practice and pronunciation with a number of flash-card style game and  a very elegant listen-record-replay interface. While the two characters do pronounce words slightly differently, hearing those variations really helps to understand the phonetics in a way that a single voice would lack. ---  --- However, this really is more of a companion tool for a more traditional course. I purchased this with "Colloquial Icelandic" and would definitely recommend purchasing them together. There are some extremely strange spelling/pronunciation variations and without having a written explanation of these things, you may be left staring in great confusion as the characters read phrases on screen -- "Hva" is pronounced "kwah?" WHAT? Having "Colluquial Icelandic" to turn to for explanation helped a great deal. That package has two audio CDs of alphabet, number, vocabulary and conversation exercises with a very well-written 370 page coursebook. ---  --- I gave this product a 5-star rating as it is superb for its intended purpose, but it does not stand alone as a complete course
We stuck this outside our bedroom window - now we can see what the temperature is outside as soon as we get up in the morning.  No more waiting for the weather to come on the news to figure out what to wear! 
These are not the same that come on the earbud, and are not easy to use, or to hear from.  I sent mine back
In my experience with this product, I had NO SIGNIFICANT HAIR GROWTH. Very disappointing for the amount of money you spend on it, and the amount of pills you have to take daily(UGH!). However, I gave it a two because while it didn't grow my hair, it did change the texture of it. My natural hair is very coarse, and while using the HF37 it became really soft, silky and manageable. Nice, if that's what you're looking for a hair vitamin to do. But as far as hair growth...ABSOLUTELY not recommending HF37 for that
This game was not engaging.  My son did not find it interesting.  He has not asked to play with it again.  You push the dice around to match letters on the cards or to spell the words yourself.   ---  --- If you want to have a fun game with more of a challenge and an element of chance, try What's GNU.  It is much better for beginning readers and it actually fun for older kids or adults. 
It tiptoes through the years and delivers the punch, but as I wrote in my review, I never thought Shangri La was going to be the last, though it appears just that. But All in the Suit, man, they did that after Shangri la de and I wonder, if this was the direction to come, my god!!!! --- It's worth it for that track alone.. --- 5 stars is my own way of saying thank you, but it is not just sentimental, the only album in the short career that wasn't great was Tiny Music, but the quote "Trippin" made up for it. --- It's a shame it's over. I don't like revolver, it's not evolution for Weiland and I can't imagine him being happy there, it steps back and all I ever hoped was that someday this band, STP, would reign supreme and been given the praise and adulation they deserve. ALl i can do is give stars, but I would rather buy another STP album or go see them live...is rock dead? I think it is and it went with this band
I just received this item and now I have to figure out how to return it. This clock is a piece of trash.  I never could set it correctly. Each time  I set the time it would advance the day when going to the normal function mode. The setting button are not protected or disabled when the clock is closed.  Even it it worked properly it is very dificult to set. --- If you buy this clock you will regret it
Tommy, what were you thinking?  Although they are lovely to look at, they are absolutely the most uncomfortable shoe, bar none.  The shoe bed is too small to accommodate the average foot and they slip off when you walk, I even tried a smaller size thinking that was the problem, I was wrong.  Take this design back to the drawing board and start again. 
I purchased this camera primarily as a back-up camera. But i find myself using it more and more inplace of my main camera.  It is a beautiful piece of work
This grill has it all, six burners, a side burner, a rotisserie with infrared burner and a smoker box with a dedicated burner.  The grill grates are 3/8" stainless steel rods that provide great grill marks on your food.  The grill heats up to 600 degrees in less than 10 minutes, but it does burn through propane rather quickly, but that wouldn't be any different with any 60,000 BTU grill.  I was able to put the grill together by myself in a little over an hour.  The fit of the pieces was fantastic and the end result was an attractive incredibly stable grill.  It has two pull-up counters with stainless steel inserts, and a cabinet with stainless doors. ---  --- So far I have made countless steaks, dogs and chicken breasts that all came out the same due to the even temperature on the grill.  My old Charbroil would give me two raw breasts, two good breasts, and two overcooked breasts... not with this grill.  I have also slowed cooked some ribs with the smoker box going and the meat fell off the bone.  But, the best meal yet was a rotisserie chicken that I prepared with a rub and injected with a marinade.  The skin was crispy and the meat was tender and juicy.   We'll be making many more of those chickens in the future. ---  --- Weber is a known commodity.  They are built to last, and given the quality of the components (with care) I expect this grill to last at least 15 years.  Many people end up having to get rid of their Weber's after 10, 12, 15 years because the cart has rusted out, but that's not an issue with this grill as the cart is constructed of 304 stainless steel. ---  --- All in all, a great grill that will last a long time.  My only cons would be the propane consumption and maybe the size.  It's probably a little too big for me and my family, but it was the only Weber that had all the features I wanted (mainly the rotisserie and the smoker box with burner).  If they had a four burner model with those options I would have gotten that, but alas the Weber Summit Platinum D4 does not exist
When we first bought our baby's mattress, it did not have any unusual odors at all. We washed the Ultimate Mattress Pad before using it, but after a short time, we began to smell an odor on the mattress that became stronger with time. We finally replaced the mattress and once again had a mattress that was stench-free. By this time we had purchased an organic mattress pad as well. Use of the organic did not cause any problem, but since we had not yet put two and two together (not smart), we put the Ultimate Mattress Pad on our new mattress just one time and sure enough it began to smell. We now use only organic mattress pads and only one side of the mattress. The side that never came in contact with the Ultimate Mattress Pad smells just fine, but the side that we did use it on has a stench you don't want your baby sleeping on. I guess you need to make sure you put a sheet between the mattress pad and the crib. We actually put the sheet over the mattress pad because the surface seemed so rough that we didn't want our little boy sleeping directly on it. When we did try that, he woke up with a mesh-imprinted face
shaver is bulky, sideburn trimmer is not attached to shaver, cool skin additive is very difficult to use for a person with rheumatoid arthriris. --- I would have exchanged it for a different model except it is to difficult to repack and mail back
I bought this product in Rite Aid.  --- Unfortunately, it irriates my face.  --- They are scamming people just to buy this product.  --- Instead of repairing my face, this product damage my face. --- There are a lot of wierd red spot that grows on my face since I start using this.  --- Now, I need to go to the dermatologist and have a surgery due to this product.  --- If I knew this will happen, I will not waste my money to buy this product.
I first saw the b&w original of "The Thing" in the late 50s (?), and was totally engrossed (jumped out of my seat with the rest of the audience, at one point) - so I knew generally what the plot might be. The story line and characters here were pretty much the same, dressed up in color and hi-tech research equipment. Nifty vistas of Alaska's bleak beauty, and a satisfying high-tech rendition of the half-uncovered alien saucer. ---  --- The suspense and drama were nonstop, and the characters interesting, individual, and credible. It was a relief that the standard beuatiful female scientist (or alien) was omitted for a change. ---  --- The Thing was believable and suitably gory and menacing, even if a little stereotyped (eg long slavering fangs, powerful tentacles, bulging eyes, and dripping goo). It and the other special effects were well done, and worth the price of admission. ---  --- I won't comment on the ending to avoid spoiling it for you, other than noting it reminded me of the old folk tale "The Lady or the Tiger."  ---  --- Engaging, entertaing reality-escape flick
The slippers are what I expected. With only a month, I can only say they do the job 
This Graco Family Tree Play Yard is perfect for newborns. The setup isn't quite as easy as the description implies, simply because the instructions are all pictures, without corresponding written directions. That said, a little patience the first time around makes setting up and putting away the play yard incredibly easy afterward. ---  --- The quilted mattress pad serves double duty to wrap around the folded up play yard when you need to take it on the go. I find this especially convenient because it guarantees that I won't leave an essential piece at home when I take the yard with me. ---  --- The description is a bit in error in regards to the mobile and the music. An attachment that sits on the side of the yard has an incredible variety of settings for vibration, music/noise, and lighting. There are different timed settings you can use to help get baby to sleep. The music is NOT, however, directly attached to the mobile. Also, the mobile sits on its own; it does not turn. That bothered me at first, but I quickly got over it when I realized my newborn didn't seem to care anyway. ---  --- The changing table sits higher than those on other play yards that I've seen, making diaper changes much easier on the back. The built in diaper holder and baby wipes holder are convenient for those rush changes. The changing table is padded and easy to clean up, though you need to use lap pads or something of that sort, as there isn't a removable pad on it. This is actually to my preference, as it's less stuff for my baby to have to contend with, but may be bothersome to parents who think their baby needs the extra cushioning. ---  --- When taking this on the go, as I said, it's easy to pack up. One minor drawback is the travel bag that holds the play yard. It doesn't have a handle, and it doesn't fit all the components of the yard. The changing table and the mobile sit at home when I take this on the go. The reality is, if I'm travelling, it's more convenient to not have these extra pieces to worry about. However, I'm not sure how I'll pack them up when my baby outgrows the changing table and is just using the yard itself. I consider that a very minor consideration though. ---  --- This play yard sits in my living room where it is incredibly convenient because it has space to hold all of my baby essentials so that I'm not having to constantly run to the nursery. I'm not sure what the parent organizers are intended to be for (they look like little soft-sided cup holders), but I've found them to be convenient places to store extra burp cloths, a pacifier, and socks that are just too little to stay together anywhere else.
I am nursing our 2 wk old, and it is just easier for me if our baby sleeps with us.  My husband is always worried he will roll over on the baby, so, he does not sleep well.  The snuggle nest has given him peace of mind and now he can sleep.  Also, the DVD has made him more comfortable taking care of the baby by himself, because he feels confident that he can calm our baby down without my help.  I only wish we would have bought this with second child
very good product.. actually came with a bonus 8 cd sleeve to attach to a car visor for free. very happy with the produc
Today I received the first issue - April 2006 issue. I found --- it AMAZING and INFORMATIVE resource for body, mind and --- soul practices toward healthier life.. ---  --- The most thing I liked about this magazine is that it respects  --- religions. It provides accurate information from various religions --- to help people of other believes improve their lives.
OK, the maps are good, but its very very combersome to use with a laptop in your car. It is very disracting and can easily cause an accident. Does not work aroung Lincoln tunnel area. Also would not find my home street, and I have been there for 2 years. Either the one I got was defected, or its not what other make it out to be. I had to return mine. --- 
I deffinatley think this was a great value for this item. Maybe someone found it cheaper elsewhere, regardless you get a lot for your money here
IT HAS BEEN SEVERAL WEEKS AND STILL NO MAGAZINE FROM MONEY!!!!OH YEAH BUT THEY DID REMEMBER TO BILL MY CREDIT CARD IN A TIMELY FASHION....MAYBE WHEN SOMETHING TAKES OVER A MONTH YOU SHOULD BILL THE PERSON WHEN  U SHIP THE PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
We subscribed to this magazine, in part due to the special offer of 12 free cycling booklets & road log with each new subscription.  What did we get?  A note letting us know that unfortunately "the gift described in the promotion is no longer available" and that "rather than keep us waiting, (they've) taken the liberty of sending the enclosed substitute..." The substitute?  A crummy little pamphlet.  ---  --- I let it slide at the time, but several months later they were still offering this special promotion, so I wrote a letter to customer service stating that "since they now had the special gift, perhaps they'd be so good as to finally send ours."  No response. ---  --- Time came to renew and all of a sudden there was that offer again... so against my better judgement, we did.  And guess what!  Another note "unfortunately the gift described in the promotion is no longer available..."  and the same crummy pamphlet!   ---  --- In short, if you're interested in being lied to, or receiving a stupid little pamphlet, by all means subscribe... if you want what you paid for, go somewhere else.
     This pack is really Bad! I LOVE attacktix, but this pack is terible! The only good figues are Luke Skywalker, and Megatron. Darth Vader's arm broke, Super Optimus Prime's blast shoots before you press the button, and the battle masters are Pathetic. The Battle Master's point value is 70 each, but they are very easy to kill, and their blasts are very bad. ---     Do yourself a faver, skip this and buy the Star Wars attacktix series 4 starter set
I was recommended this product for my son's hair and have had many recommendations over the years, since he has beautiful thick curly hair that can tend to be dry and frizzy.  I used a little of this product in his wet hair and it leaves it shiny with less frizz and more curls.  He is 10 and not crazy about the smell, but I think it smells nice.  Fantastic product
T. Dorau -- when properly stored, what you complain about will never happen.  A battery should -never- be stored in sub-zero or near-freezing temperatures.  Don't leave it in the garage! ---  --- This unit offers "quick" recharging (4 to 5 hours) from a 12V source or gradual recharging (12 to 24 hours) from an AC source. ---  --- The AC source may be left connected indefinitely (true "float" charging) which is a plus for a standby power source.  The inclusion of the LED light source is very thoughtful on the part of the designer(s). ---  --- In addition to jump starting a car, this is a good choice for small household items (TV, Radio, Weather Alert Radio) or emergency communications equipment (CB, Ham Radio). ---  --- This product also appears in some stores under the "Husky" and "Vector" brand-names
I've never ordered anything and been this disappointed.  I ordered two of these and both didn't work.  I contacted the company's tech support and they told me to send it back and they will replace it.  I tried contacting Ritz Camera where I purchased the item and they refused to give me a refund.  I am now stuck dealing with this company that has horrible customer support.  I will never buy another product from this company again. 
Not to be disrespectful but are you people for real? I can't believe this book is getting 4 and 5 stars. There was nothing good about this book. A bunch of people in the book did not even matter, Bill Kendall's wife, the new anchor man Pete whatever his last name was, the boss Yelena, Eliza's boyfriend, the priest, even the soon-to-be-president and his wife, I mean what's the point in even mentioning them? They were not involved in the main events. She didn't even talk about what happened to them at the end. The judge is the only one that matters, and she didn't even write about him all that much. Really disappointing. As I said I don't mean to be disrespectful, but to give this book 5stars, you must have read either bedtime stories all your life, or not have read anything.  --- DON"T WASTE YOUR MONEY that's all i have to say. sorr
Save your time, money and patience.  This may be the worst book I have read since the equally monotonous, predictable Stone Barrington novel "The Short Forever".  Wow, this one stinks.  Like others, I put up with the shallow characters, ludicrous dialogue and endless parade of showers, boobs and guns to figure out whodunit.  Unfortunately, this book had an ambiguous ending that seeks to be clever but is instead is just stupid.  Who on earth did kill Vance?  And come to think of it, who gives a damn?  I don't what women did to Stuart Woods but he sure seems to hold them in complete contempt.  Every female character, save for Isabel the maid, felt compelled to practically rape our handsome hero.  Each is flawless and gorgeous but also all are dumb, vacuous, self-centered and thoroughly unlikeable - hey a couple are even truly psychotic!  The only normal female character who spared Stone, Mary Ann, unfortunately has a room temperature IQ.  I am hardly a prude, but I lost count of how many women either Vance or Stone made love to in the course of one short novel and felt the need to take a long hot shower to rid myself of the feelings of filth.  Mr. Woods either lives in a world of complete ignorance or the reading public is a lot less discriminating than I thought
I was looking for a good nursing nightgown to wear while in the hospital after giving birth to my second child.  I had seen the Aimee gown before, and I really liked the looks of it, and the reviews seemed great. ---  --- After purchasing the gown (was shipped via Fed Ex to Canada, which means I got dinged by Fedex's "customs broker" costs...) I tried it on while 8 months pregnant to see how it fits. ---  --- I purchased a size XL as I am around a sz 14 pre-pregnancy.  I have a normal bust size of 36D. ---  --- The gown itself is made of a nice heavyweight cotton with lots of stretch and recovery (doesn't just stretch out and stay there), the crossover top is really nice becuase it crosses over and will be easy to pull aside for nursing, but the v isn't too deep  (nobody needs to see *that* much of my clavicle).  There is a slit up the side for ease of walking, but it's a very high slit, too high, I felt.  ---  --- The gown didn't fit well over my pregnant belly - but I don't fault them for that, it's not advertised as fitting during pregnancy.  However, after giving birth, I still don't think it would fit well for the first couple of weeks, until the baby belly subsides a bit.  The gown stretches well enough to fit over a slowly-declining bump, but unfortunately, as you walk around, the elastic contracts the gown back up over your bump, pulling the slit on the side higher and higher up your leg.  The gown itself is long enough to more than cover your bump as it retracts, but it's not a comfortable feeling when that slit creeps higher and higher. ---  --- The bustline will be great when I'm nursing - easy to pull over, and great coverage on the other side.  It fits well under the bust (elasticised under the cups) but I found the cups were HUGE on my breasts.  It fit well at the band, but I guess they figure if you're a big girl, you must have big boobs.  Luckily, I'm handy at sewing, so I plan to take the gown up at the shoulders to fix this. ---  --- Overall, I think this will be a great gown to wear around the house while breastfeeding.... after the baby belly has subsided.  I do plan to bring it to the hospital with me, but only after I've taken in the seams at the shoudlers, and closed the side slit a bit
Supposed being victimized by local communist regime and Soviet oppressors since August-1968, a skilled surgeon changed countries and jobs like  surgical gloves he did at hospitals. ---  --- No wonder, sex is a fix for such a lucky, and marriage to a beautiful adorable woman stopped a character with Southern European rather than Slavic appearance a little. ---  --- Extended up to 165 minutes of screening, romantic tale with some near-porno inclusions is a bit more over-positive and over-entertaining than its final collapsed in. ---  --- Well, movie spirit seems being similar to "A Beautiful Life", "Producers" or, more recent one of Levi's Hitler-as-a-comedy-hero, of what optimism and humoristic style used to depicting the tragedy serve well cinemagoers seeking a relaxation only. 
This CD was supposed to expose a new side of Dar Willams, it has failed to do this. The lyrics, and songs are repetitive of previous works. I would suggest buying something else
We have it hanging in a closet and it has been working great!  When it changes color all I do is plug it in for about 10-12 hours and then hang it back up again!  We are very satisfied
The battery function didn't work. Discovered poor battery wiring inside... I might try troubleshooting it myself with an ammeter and some soldering. I'm not surprised by the crude construction from a $11 item. However, the hand grips themselves are worth the money. No more cramped hands
This piece is really quite over-priced for what you get, though not having the knife allows you to bring this on a plane with you.  I've seen this unit marketed elsewhere as a "travel-friendly" Swiss Army tool (not knife). ---  --- Nevertheless, the unit I have is the 64MB version of: --- ASIN: B0002VM8ZM --- ...which costs considerably less (~$30) on Amazon, has the same 128MB USB drive and red light as the unit on this page, plus you get a small quantity of Swiss Army tools INCLUDING a knife.  Unless you are concerned about going on a plane, I'd recommend the ASIN: B0002VM8ZM over the unit on this page.  BTW, I got my handy little 64MB unit (which I'd give four stars for if I had the option) for only $9.99 on clearance at Target.
Everthing about this movie was bad.  The Acting, the story, the revenge of the nerds like characters and humor.  The acting and production value was so bad that you'd think it was a home made movie with somebody using a home camera from 1975.  How much did it cost them to film this movie?  50 bucks?  The Revenge of the Nerds like script has been done to death and has never been funny to begin with
Can you use the Action Relpay on ur Xbox for multiplayergames, like on halo2 can u use codes their and make it so you get unlimited ammo,  because that is the only reason why i want to use this product is so that i can have unlimited ammo and not have to reload. i would want invinsibility  but then it would be obvious that i was cheatin, and when u read that u probablly thought, well its gonna look like ur cheating when ur guy doesnt have to reload and doesnt run out of ammo. but still i would like to know this before i buy it. i will probably end up buying it anyways to see wut this pup can do
I purchased a Sony 5-disk CD changer in 1991 that could shuffle between all five disks. This model can only shuffle tracks on one disk at a time. What were they thinking? The ability to shuffle tracks between disks was my entire reason for choosing a five disk changer vs. a single disk CD/DVD player. THIS BABY IS GOING BACK
Bobbi Brown makes excellent lip colors.  They are very smooth, and have some staying power
I got this watch to help me with running, walking and yoga. It was a little difficult to figure out all of the set up, but I am thrilled with the end result. ---  --- I recommend this product to any woman looking for a watch to use for multiple workout programs
I'll never eat microwave popcorn again!  This is quick and delicious and looks and tastes like movie theater popcorn, only better!  It's hard to believe, but true
This is my third digital camera and by far my favorite. I purchased after having a very versatile but large (well large in the dimensions of digital cameras) digital camera. I needed and wanted a camera that I could easily carry w/ me at all times. This is perfect. ---  --- The Fugi Z1 fits easily into your pocket or a small case for easy access. Just don't put anything else in that pocket! The one time I forget and did this I noticed a large scratch on the silver portion of the camera. ---  --- As with all digital cameras this one takes much better pictures in good lighting. I have found, however, that this tiny camera has an excellent flash so I am still able to get good interior shots if I am willing to blind people (or my cats) for a few seconds. ---  --- The camera comes w/ a docking station that I have found very useless for uploading pictures but you have to use it to charge the camera. I tend to just use a USB cable direct to the computer or a really cheap USB card reader that I can attach directly to my computers USB port. ---  --- I took this camera to Japan and it was great. I only had one day where I ran out of battery power but that was my own fault. ---  --- This is a highly recommended camera by me
No support or response to questions, only 1/2 of the functions work, not a bad design but it was obviously released full of bugs.  Try cosmic blobs
I feel bad doing this becuase I love Iggy and the stooges but the quality on this set is pretty bad. All the live recordings are worth listening to and probably owning but the quality is very rough and can get frustrating. It's like the first Beatles Anthology set: the material is amazing but the quality is bad. On the plus side the studio outtakes are decent quality wise and amazing content wise. The packaging is also very nice. I just though I'd share this information before you drop all the money on the set. If you are a Stooges fan don't hesitate purchase now but if this is your introduction you should probably wait.
Satisfying and good-tasting. A little heavy on calories unless it is a meal replacement
I was required to purchase this with my new computer. I thought I'd give it a chance at work. We have a dedicated wired network, which just requires that you register the machine's MAC address with our DHCP server. Nice and simple, and very much like the LAN in any home where the user has a NAT router. ---  --- I plugged in the network and tried to get the MAC address. Vista would only give me the wizard to connect my network. OK, I tried the wizard. It offers to let me setup PPPoE with a username and password. That's it, no other options. I asked for other options, and it only offered that I use a modem (that I did not have in my computer.) No options for a dedicated network at all, that I could find. ---  --- I went to another machine (on the 'net) and searched Google. None of the Microsoft sites were helpful in any way. Lots of PR posturing, but no useful information or troubleshooting. ---  --- I gave up, found the license and install disks for Windows XP, and downgraded the new machine. It was far, far easier.
I bought this stroller after having a 7 year old peg perego hand me down. I loved the old one but it looked like it had one thousand miles on it, as a friend told me so I gave it to my mom to use. I knew it was important to get a good stroller that would last rather than buying cheap ones. I am a very price sensitive, I shop at consignment shops, etc and I still feel the money spent is worth it! ---  --- The reason I like this stroller: ---  --- 1. You can guide it with one hand. --- 2. There is a spot for bags, etc underneath.  --- 3. The cup holder for mommy and child. (this is an extra accessory) --- 4. It's lightweight and you can pop it open and closed easily.  --- 5. The five point harnes
My son begged for this game, and the price is reasonable compared to some games so we added it to our collection.  He enjoyed levels 1 & 2, but once we got to level 3 that was it!  Unless you have earned the nickname "Fast fingers" or "Fury Feet" don't bother purchasing this until you rent it.  I spent an hour trying to beat level 3 for my 6 year old the only thing I discovered was that I did equally as well when I randomly hit the 4 keys as quickly as possible (about 57% accurate) as I did actually keeping up.  Being this is only level 3 I can only imagine the "Dance Levels" get harder from here, Good Luck!!
I have tried a dozen screen guards, some of them shine a lot, some of them are not as clear as they promise, some take like 2 hrs to stick on the screen without any air bubble. This makes its way through all that problems. Well on the other hand it does have a catch --- 1. Finger print magnet --- 2. The price - THAT PRICE FOR ONE!!! --- And yea the best part is its static not gum, and its washable.
These are fast but inaccurate and break easily bet bigger and more accurate bb'
I first smelled this perfume on a colleague of mine, about a year ago. Every time she walked by me I got a whiff of this heavenly scent that she wore nearly every day. So, I finally stopped her and asked what she was wearing. I'd never heard of it, so I jumped online and looked it up, found a bottle and bought it. I couldn't wait to try it out, so when the perfume finally arrived I put it right on. Imagine my disappointment when I smelled a scent totally unlike the one I'd experienced. On me it was overpoweringly musky, nothing like the seductive fragrance I'd smelled on my colleague. But, an odd thing happened. I didn't wash it right off, and when I smelled it again about 30 minutes later it had become the alluringly sensual perfume I'd fallen in love with. In fact, the longer I wore it the better it smelled. Obviously it depends on your body chemistry to achieve it's bloom. Now, I wear it when I go out in the evenings, and people comment on how wonderfully sexy it smells. If you buy this perfume don't judge it too quickly, as I did....give it a little time and you're sure to love it. You only need to use a little, and it lasts for HOURS.
We all LOVE this toy.  What I like about it, is that it's easy to use, even for my almost three yr old, it has realistic sounds yet not obnoxious, it's sturdy, (Will only tip when it knocks into something pretty hard) it LOOKS good, not cheap, and it's pretty wallet friendly as far as price goes. ---  --- This has been THE big hit this Christmas.  Even more so than Tekno Puppy
A perfect fit for my L6. I love the protection for the screen....it covers all of it so you don't need those plastic screen covers. Don't be afraid if you drop your phone... because it's protected
These are great if you have oily or combination skin. Just press onto your face and it instantly takes away the oil and the shine. It won't ruin your makeup and you can use them discreetly almost anywhere, anytime. These are very similar to the blotting sheets sold by MAC cosmetics -- except these are cheaper and work just as great. I've even caught my boyfriend using it on his face so I guess it would be great for a Metrosexual. LOL!!! You'll love these as much as I do. 
I got this for my 15 month son. HE REALLY LOVES IT! He doesn't use it as a ride-on yet (more fun will await!), but he pushes the car from the back handle everywhere inside & out. there are alot of buttons which make sounds and some have the car talk back. The "oil change" sounds are his fav. HE also enjoys the toy phone(when you put it in the slot it rings and the car answers!) There is also a small storage section under the seat.. The only thing I wish it did have was a horn sound instead of one of the many car's sayings. For the price it is a great interactive toy!! And for a boy who usually is not big on his toys for very long, this still captures his attention months afterward!.oh, and this toy can take a beating! No complaints whatsoever! A great find
I dont know what everyone else's reviews have said but beleieve me this game is awesome!  The graphics are out of this world, and its very suspenseful.  There's a murder or dead body around every corner, and you get to firgure out who did it!  The ending was the best, it took me and my brother at least 24 hours, (not all at once of course), to solve this mystery.  It's a really great buy! ~Andre
I sent this to a male friend of mine. I find men difficult to shop for, however this was an excelelnt choice. It actually does project the time onto the wall or ceiling. According to my friend, the alarm works well and is loud enough. There is a unit that you place outside and it recieves the accurate time from an atomic clock that it then broadasts back to the in house unit. It also acts as a thermometer so you know the outside temp. Your man should be pleased with this
I LOVE IT SOOOOO MUCH IT'S THE BIG NEW THING ... CAN'T WAIT 4 THE NEXT EPISODE..
Had the Reese Sleeved lock on my Tow Hitch Step  for a year now & damn if I can get the thing off !!!  We have tried Graphite (dry) Graphite Liquid --- everything short of cutting the thing off. The key  (a flat one) won't BUDGE in the lock.   ---  --- Newer Reese towpower locks have round keys (like Vending machine keys) on them.  My cover has been on the lock ever since I bought it & today it is 87 degrees outside. Still the lock won't allow the key to turn in it. after 10 minutes of working on it with the CTP keys it budged a little, but it still didn't unlock ALL the way.  ---  --- Tomorrow I am going to get my Custom Truck specialist to torch it off. Next time I will buy the MASTERLOCK  Brand.
have had dark circles caused by pigmentation for four years and have tried everything.have been using hylexin for just five days and honestly its been amazing.i saw all the bad reviews and im glad they didnt stop me.for the first time in years i dont need a concealer.will continue to keep you posted as i hope in the nxt week or two not to have any circles at all.(if it continues this way) i think mayb the product doesnt work for hereditery circles
I wish this magazine came out more often (as another reviewer said).  It would be fascinating for anyone with the slightest interest in the history of technology and engineering.  Recent articles have covered vacuum tubes, their history, and why some are still used now, and nuclear power and how that industry stalled in America.  I remember reading another article in the mid-'90s about a guy in New York City who shoveled coal for a public school furnace.  He explained his job and how hard it was to buy a coal shovel (the hardware store people couldn't believe it).  A few years later they followed up with a note that all public schools in NYC had been converted from coal, and that the coal-shoveler's job was MUCH easier maintaining the new furnace.  Stories on iron bridges and how Necco wafers are made (with the same machine for 100 years or so) and how buttons are made from seashells and how paper clips are made and how a Hollywood actress designed a frequency-jumping weapons guidance system and all sorts of others are included.  Lots of cool articles about how everyday (and not-so-common) technologies went from ideas in someone's mind to products that are ready for use
this is a great language learning program- you get going on it and before you know it you are ten lessons ahead. i've learned a lot already
         This writting instrument is superb in it's ability to compensate the energetic writer
Buying this was a mistake. This bra lifts up exposing half my breats which is visible under a shirt. The straps are not comfortable, it's cuts deep into the shoulders-it should be atleast padded. Def. not what I expected from this product. The material and pattern is the only thing I liked; it has a sexy look to it
One could review Kingdom of Heaven on a lot of levels ... as an action packed medieval adventure/romance ... as a vehicle for some of your favorite actors ... or as a statement about humanity's less than perfect attempts to find spiritual meaning in life in a way that doesn't lead to warfare with people of differing points of view.  I was expecting mostly the first two ... and was pleasantly surprised to find a reasonable amount of the third.   My favorite quote from the movie summed up a powerful feeling I've had about spirituality for some time now: ---  --- "God will understand, my lord. And if he doesn't, then he is not God and we need not worry."   ---  --- Why people so infrequently ask themselves whether the god they believe in really makes sense to their hearts or not, I don't know.  And when I heard these words coming from the screen, I realized "someone out there understands ... we don't find God in books or doctrine or sermons ... we know God in our hearts, or not at all".  This character looked to his heart and knew ... God will understand ... and anyone who doesn't is surely not God, no matter what someone else might claim.  ---  --- And if you loved the movie, you'll enjoy this DVD ... it's a classy widescreen handling of a film that's visually rich and deserves to be seen in it's cinematic format. With gorgeous scenery and delightful characters and costuming, I can't imagine watching such a visually appealing film in less than wide screen form.  
Do you want the real secret on how to grow your hair? First, you need to have a healthy diet that includes plenty of vegetables and protein. PROTEIN! Then you have to keep your hair and scalp clean, trim your ends, and not use heating appliances all the time! Lastly, drink water! That's the secret! You go on a hair care board and you'll find people who swear by Vivisical. They'll show you before and after pictures and in the after picture it's just the person with their head tilted all the back just to make it look like their hair grew 5 inches in 2 months! Don't believe that nonsense! If you buy Viviscal, you're a sucker! You're better off just taking a multi-vitamin
I saw the other review that said it didn't work for V173, but I bought this anyway for my V170.  It also doesn't work for V170.  Why Amazon is advertising and selling this product as a Motorola V170 charger is beyond me.  I guess sometimes the products are mislabeled. 
Very nice trimmer. My hat off to Remington. I have been using this trimmer on both my hair and beard. It words perfectly and is much better than changing spacers
I am a six foot tall women with large size ribs and medium chest and this backpack fits me very well.  As I am large and this pack fits me, I would think this would ajust to a small person well.  I especially like all the padding on the surface that meets your back.  I hike hills up to two hours with my seven month old (19 lbs) in the pack without problems.  The built in shade cover is great as you dont have to put it on and off as needed.  The pack is very comfortable for both of us.  The interior of the pack also adjusts for the baby size and as mine grows taller, I can drop him lower in the pack.  I looked at many other more expensive packs as I thought they would be better fitted out, but this pack has all the features I wanted for a lower price.  I highly recommend this pack.
on time delivery - would have been nice to have a gift wrap optio
This is a wonderful Vangelis album and is fairly energetic, with enough experimental flourishes to keep the listener fully engaged.   Released in 1975, Heaven and Hell incorporates a full choir into the Vangelis sound.  ---  --- Vangelis played all of the instruments on this album including synthesizers, electric piano, acoustic piano, a full drum kit, and percussion.  Vangelis is joined by the English Chamber Choir (conducted by Guy Protheroe) with Vana Veroutis as the lead female vocal, in addition to Jon Anderson (vocals/lyrics on Heaven and Hell (Part 1 So Long Ago, So Clear).  Vangelis is quite a good musician and really shines on the acoustic piano. As a huge Yes fan, I was delighted to hear Jon's excellent voice and cosmic lyrics.  As far as the inclusion of the choir goes, I did not mind it that much and felt that it added a very interesting textural element to the recording. ---  --- The Heaven and Hell suite is divided into two lengthy movements including Part I (21'58") and Part II (21'16").  In general, the first part is more orchestral in nature and features the choir and excellent acoustic piano playing by Vangelis.  Another general observation is that the first movement mixes vigorous sections that feature drums with spacey and haunting synth-dominated passages.  Of course, my favorite part comes at the end of Part I, which is the 4'58" section with Jon on vocals.  This short "song" is quite moving and uplifting.  Movement II is a little darker and more experimental than the first movement and is my favorite of the two.  The choir is featured on the second movement, along with a beautiful wordless vocal by the very talented Vana Veroutis.  Part II closes with a very spacey and quiet synthesizer section, which provides excellent contrast with the preceding thunderous percussion section. ---  --- All in all, this is a good Vangelis album and is recommended along with Albedo 0.39 (1976); Spiral (1977); and the excellent Opera Sauvage (1979)
Three problems with this film: ---  --- 1. PACING - The film's pacing doesn't vary.  It's very boring.  As a matter of fact, this wouldn't be a problem if the film were much more tense (e.g., "Speed"), however this film lacks the high-action intensity to pull off such a slow expository speed.   ---  --- 2. EFFECTS - Too many sequences of this film rely on color and light superimpositions, and there is an overabundance of high-speed imaging.  The scene changes that employ erratic barrages of images desensitize the viewer from the thrilling "horror" scenes.  Furthermore, they fail to make enough sequential sense of the film's plot to really mean much to the film as a greater whole.  The upshot: the film relies too heavily on the art of editing, to the point where plot twists are no longer interesting.   ---  --- 3. TRIVIALITY - The plot's conclusion quails in the face of the "so what?" question.  The viewer is left with a sense of, "I sat through the film for THAT?"  In light of points (1) and (2), this obnoxious bit is the icing on the cake.   ---  --- Don't waste your life. ---  --- ALon
I bought a sight from Airsplat for my son's airsoft rifle as a Christmas gift. The screws were too short to attach it to his Kitty Kat ( a shortened M-4) airsoft rifle's weaver rail. Yes, I could go out and find screws the proper length, but I though I'd make Airsplat do their job.  ---  --- So, after several e-mails with the service department, they shipped screws that they claimed were the right size. Wrong. The diameter of the new screws is so big they won't fit through the mounting bracket on the sight. Obviously it was too hard to try this out in the store to see if it would really mount on a weaver rail before selling the product or when they sent replacement screws. Take a pass on Airsplat. The sight seems ok for the price.
This toy is great for little boys or girls who love equipment. I got this item for my son 2 nd birthday gift and he just loves it. It is a tiny tractor and it is just like his grandpa's tractor so which makes him a very happy little boy. THIS IS A GREAT ITEM
Unfortunately I never received the product I purchased.  The company claimed that they sent via USPS and I never received it.  So as far as the company is concerned I am out of the money I spent, plus the product.  I have received no satisfaction
The quality of this tea is far below that of other matcha's I have tried. The packaging alone is careless and does not bespeak of the tender care that is typically given to green tea, particularly the fine powder. I would not purchase this product again. The quantity that I do have, I will cut with other better tea rather than waste it. If you do try this product, use care opening the package, because the tea is inside without any barrier to keep it from spilling
Hey hey, Kids.  It's the Moleskine Large Ruled Notebook.  It's not just any ordinary notebook.  This thing is LEGENDARY.  How could it ever let you down?  Did you know it was used by Hemingway?  How about Picasso--I bet you never would have guessed that.  And this thing was designed in ITALY--the land of the great notebook!!  Don't except the cheap knockoff versions from Canada or El Salvador. ---  --- If you're looking at this notebook I'm sure you already know what to expect.  Do you like writing?  Do you like big pockets?  Do you like a journal that will take a licking and keep on ticking?  Then don't consider anything else.  Just stop shopping right this second and grab the Moleskine Large Ruled Notebook!  (Unless of course you need a Small Ruled Notebook...then look else where.
I bought these for my Zune after an exhaustive search for a good sounding, compact headphone for work and working out at the gym. ---  --- If you are like me and can't stand all the earbuds out there, then you need to find another solution. I tried the Premium Zune buds at 40 bucks, and the Bose Quiet comfort buds at 100 bucks, but they just gave me earaches and I was always fiddling with them to keep them in my ear canal tight.  ---  --- I read countless reviews of this headphone and I can say this is the best sounding under $40 headphone out there that won't mess with your hair. (Yes, better than even the Bose earbuds!) --- If you are only using the stock buds or phones with your mp3 player, be prepared to be blown away. Tight, full bass range with smooth airy highs and mellow mids. You don't have to crank them either, they sound rich even at lower volumes. But if you do crank them they don't distort at all. If you have ever tried the Bose Quiet comforts at the stores, these sound very similar but with an open air design! ---  --- The only negative is the comfort. The little rubbery clips that go behind your ears take some getting used to and can hurt after 30 minutes or so. I think I'll get used to it. I'd much rather deal with a little discomfort on the outer ear vs. jamming an earbud in my ear and getting a sore ear canal (which I had). That could lead to ear infections or other more serious ear problems. ---  --- Some other reviewers complained about the headband, but it sounds like they were not wearing these right. Once on your noggin, the band needs rotated up toward you skull in the back till it touches your head. This keeps everything nice and tight and also gives the earclips more space and flexibilty which equals greater comfort. I do not think the headband is too tight, it has the perfect amount of tension to keep these in place. ---  --- I might buy a pair of the PX 100's as well just for wearing around the house or lying in bed reading.  The PX 100 is the same exact phone in an "over the head" design. At $40, I can afford to get both
I love this product, But I wish I could see all floors put together as completed home in 3D view.
With his snarling, gritty guitar tones, swampy grooves, and scratchy vocals, C.C. Adcock makes butt-shakin' music that blends rockabilly, old-school Memphis R&B, New Orleans funk, Cajun dancehall tunes, and juke-joint blues. He's young, but no poseur: Having paid dues with Bo Diddley and Buckwheat Zydeco, Adcock knows rootsy textures like the back of his hand. But despite the tremolo guitar and slapped upright bass, this isn't a retro-sounding record. Adcock and his various producers bring a hip sonic edge to the music that keeps the moods fresh and the vibe ominous. Doyle Bramhall joins Adcock on two songs, and together they raise 6-string hell. Boasting richly layered guitars and heaps of attitude, Adcock's music is soulful, somewhat twisted, and deeply satisfying
Set up easily, stores easily, transports easily.  For grilled meals for two [skewered food, sausages, steaks, burgers, fish, corn on the cob] it has grilled more efficiently for us than our big BBQ.  The folding "legs" keep the direct heat off any surface underneath.  With this efficient little griller, we're enjoying patio cook-outs much more frequently than before
Anything Leappad is great . Its one of the best things to come from the computer toy area for kids yet. My son is ahead of his class in reading with the help of Leappad. At 6 he reads at a midrange grade 1 student and is progressing quickly. I highly recommend This and any other Leap pad book and toy . Most schools have dropped Phonics from the classrooms and Leappad has brought it back in a fun form your little one will love..
This is the BEST book written by Stephen King!  I've read it twice and will probably read it about ten more times before I die
I don't know what planet that guy is from who is saying below that he had to wait a long time, if he bought a pair of glasses he would notice that you have to wait for 12-16 weeks for every magazine you order from Amazon. I had no problem with that-- I think the Strand is a unique magazine. With fiction by such great writers as Sir John Mortimer, Edward Marston, and great interview with actor Michael York. They also have fine articles one such article was about Hercule Poirot & Agatha Christie. They are doing a great job
I boutght this razor for my husband.  He likes it, but notes that it is hard to clean and does not get the longer whiskers, which he seems to miss a lot.  I think that if he shaved more carefully, he would get these whiskers before they get too long!  I think that for the price (lower end of price range), it does a pretty good job.  Next time, I'll buy him a more expensive one and hope that it performs better. 
Sounds like the background music used in the 70's Rockford Files TV crime show...and a little like the CHIPS music too. Similar to music by Tom Scott from back then. The crusaders never really get hard funky or dirty funky, they are more smooth groovin funk. The sound for the times is very clean, too produced for true funkyness. Don't get me wrong I like the old 60's JAZZ crusaders, just not this 70's phase of their career...they sold out to a large extent, and continue to do so, it's where the money is.  No improvisatory feel either. This is for smooth jazz lovers. hard funk lovers will be disappointed, as will true jazzers.  I wish the crusaders kept their jazz chops from the 60's but they keep burying it like it never happened, even to this day, afraid to lose sales if they get too musically adverturous like their mid/late 60's true jazz albums. Their 70's albums like this are partly to blame for today's smooth jazz... in other words, not really jazz, not really funky, just kind of smooth groovin, more for casual adults and offices. not challenging, not offensive, formulated to an extent. But hey if you like this, that's cool, just dont think it's real jazz, or real funk. It's smooth and casual, slightly simmers, pleasant background music, but doesn't COOK like so many other groups from the same time period that mixed jazz, funk, and fusion. It just sounds like they are holding back...I know they can play more advanced, and write more creatively, they just choose not to ever since the 60's
get this gun but dont even concider getting the elecric version its a huge waste of cash. there like $70 -$80 and they only get about 20 feet of range when u point it at a 45 degree angle up. yeah its that bad. but this gun shoots good
This software was easy to install.  The Terms and Conditions of Use are very clearly stated.  I found the choice of difficulty levels greatly enhanced the product and challenged me.  The puzzles are fun and the techniques required to play are easily understood. My one wish is that there were more varied games included.... But it is a lot of fun and is definitley challenging..
I JUST got out of the shower a minute ago, and I must say this is the best shampoo I've ever bought. My scalp hasn't felt this clean and fresh in a long time. Washing my super-thick and waist length hair didn't feel like a chore for once, and I actually look forward to my next washing. The smell reminds me of the hippie shops on Haight Street in San Francisco. I love it
This is truly one of the best hand and nail creams out there.  It is quickly absorbed and not at all greasy - I put some on before I walk out the door in the morning and again before bedtime and it has made a real difference in the softness of my hands and the health of my cuticles.  Hangnails have always been a problem for me but this product keeps them under control as long as I apply it regularly. Love it!
The Raising Arizona part of the CD is almost exclusively electronic and only one 90 second track of the great banjo that I remember from the movie.  I recommend listening to samples before you buy
I purchased 5 of these for myself and coworkers. We are all on our feet all day long. After one other coworker told us about the one he had, we all had to have one to help our tired feet. Everyone of us is very happy with this product. It is a great value for the price. There are other messagers that are more expensive but these are just super. We did have a problem with one, but Amazon quickly exchanged it for us. I think it was defective from the factory. Great product and even better service from Amazon
I have a DCS-900W camera that failed within a year. After that, I made 7 calls to their customer service and tried to get it returned and replaced. Obviously I was talking to some indian people overseas that don't seem to care about the "service" that much, and usually after a couple of transfers, the line got cut off or picked up by another layman. During conversation, the line quality is very bad. ---  --- After a while, I just decided that $100 camera is not worth the time of the calls. I am in the process of reporting their practice to the better business bureau. ---  --- Based on my experience, I would be reluctant to buy any expensive things from D-Link. Once you have any problem, they just won't honor the waranty
I recently purchased this camera and I'm loving it. As a whole it's very easy to use and carry. I'm a college student going into photograpy and this is a great starter camera. I have a feeling this one is going to be with me for a very long time
  With a good selection of colors to go with the casual style, to say I love these shoes is an understatement. They are very comfortable, and have grown on me so much, they are about the only casual style shoes I have bought in the past few years
I love the JLab MiniBlaster because no matter where I go I can have my favorite music with me.  The sound is clear and I found this product easy to use. I will be giving several of these for holiday gifts and birthday presents to friends and relatives, young and old.  The delivery was prompt, and I appreciated the friendly customer service in response to my questions
I recently a box of two 12 ounce bottles of this Neutrogna produst at COSTCO for approximately $9.00.  $22.00 for the same quantity is too expensive for me to want to shop for these products at Amazon
Good, flattering fit.  I'm 5'2" and I bought a short which was perfect and long enough to wear with heels, even a bit long actually.  Unfortunately when I washed them, they shrank 2" and now I have to wear them with flats.  I would buy them again, just in a longer length
I'm really disappointed in this book, because the author seems to imply that you can have ANYTHING you want, but that is just not the case.  It's a deceptive title.   ---  --- I can honestly say that this book is worthless and is not going to help you; you're better off practising Feng Shui and hanging little crystals in your house than reading this book (and I'm not knocking Feng Shui, I practise it myself).  People like the author of this book just want to make a quick buck at your expense.  In the end, you'll just feel worse off, looking for the "next big thing" to promise you some more snake oil. ---  --- Another fact I'd like to point out is that this author sells this book in CD format for around $60.00 (I got a flyer in the mail).  If he is truly living life according to his principles why would he even charge for these so-called "secrets," doesn't that go against his own moral values?  One of the gimmicks of the CDs is that you can learn the secret sound of "creation," as if chanting "Ahhhh" is going to make everything alright.  Thanks to Dyer and others like him, I am completely against any sort of "positive thinking" Guru.  They are only after YOUR money (while you keep wishing you had more). ---  --- *Btw, you might be interested to know that after reading this book, you're only going to find out that the BIG CATCH is that Manifesting Your Destiny, according to the author, ONLY applies to spiritual matters.  Huh?  Yes.  The entire book promises you can have anything you want, but it has absolutely nothing to do with material prosperity.  The author also wants you to know that if your desire is not in accordance with "God's" plan, you don't have a chance either.  Thought I'd mention that before you read this book and end up feeling cheated! --- 
Mom was looking for a similar item, from "Bass".  I told her this brand was very reliable.  She can put them down
I ordered the magizine subsribtion and when I ordered they told me it would take up to 6 weeks, So I went out and bought that months issue.  A few weeks later that issue came, which is understandable but they had sent me the previous month before that.  I hadnt even ordered my subsription that month.
The product was in excellent condition and the shipping was the fastest I have seen to be from regular postal service. It got here less than a week
cases very cheaply made. Break when opening. Not worth shipping cost waste of money
It appears that the problem of slow readings described in the earlier reviews has been solved, as my gauge reads continuously.  The reading drops several psi while bleeding just as with a mechanical dial gauge.  The reading takes about two seconds to re-stabilize, so a mechanical gauge is actually faster to use. ---  --- The quick-connector on the end of the hose is excellent, but be careful to not scratch the wheel with it.  The hose is fairly stiff, but isn't a problem most of the time. ---  --- I used this gauge at the track this past weekend, and was pleased with it until the second morning when it was cold (by cold I mean 45F, this is Houston...) and the display read 'Lo', indicating a low battery.  So essentially the gauge was useless.  The hose also becomes annoyingly stiff when cold. ---  --- Overall, a good mechanical gauge is easier to use and more reliable, as long as you don't drop it
The gloves we got do not get warmer with use of the batter
No Risistence at All !! U might must swing your arms n legs in air..
My 3 1/2 year old little girl saw the "Charlie Brown Christmas" on TV this year and loved it so much that I had to order it.  She watched it over and over and enjoyed it as much as I did over 40 years ago when I was a kid.  Just goes to show that some things never get old.  And, what a treat to be able to share it with her now. 
It does the basic job well.  The calibration runs smoothly and accurately.  Hardware looks and feels solid.  My two completely different brand, size and age CRT monitors ended up with exactly the same colors sitting side by side.  ---   --- User interface is merely adequate.  Pop up help instructions are better than many I have seen.  You will need to know already how the calibration buttons on your monitors work (the hardwired buttons on the monitor, not software).  In order to make any edits you must run the entire time consuming calibration over.  Sometimes you can use "back" within the calibration, sometimes you must start over.  Also the separate "profile chooser" utility software, has not add or delete profile feature - even if it is a profile created and saved by the calibration software earlier.  You can see it with windows display properties, but it may not appear in the profile chooser list. ---  --- Dual monitors is the one obvious reason to choose pro over plus version.  Yes, it does dual monitors, but with an asterisk.  It will create separate profiles, but will only apply the correct profiles automatically at startup to both monitors if you have two separate video cards.  If you have a single video card with dual outputs, it will load the same profile (the last one you created) to both monitors at startup.  This quirk is documented in a readme file on the installation disk (and blames windows for the problem), but this limitation appears nowhere in advertising material, catalogs,  or on the box.  Fortunately there is a work around (not documented) at least with my particular video card and running XP.  After windows opens, you can run profile chooser then choose the correct profile for each monitor.  You may have to use windows display properties settings to specify default profile and rerun the calibration to get the profiles you want to appear in profile chooser and to select the correct profile as default.  ---  --- Once it's all set up, running profile chooser is a four of five click procedure, but you must rememeber to check it before using any application that uses color profiles.  And check it after you open the application.  I've had them change after opening photoshop - though not every time.        ---                ---  ---        ---  ---  --- 
I ought this for my daughter for her 1st birthday.  She loves the bead maze at the top and she goes round and round the cube exploring all the different sides!   ---  --- So as the title would suggest, the stickers on the cog wheels are starting to come off (after 1 week).  This doesnt affect the functionality of the toy, just the aesthetics.  If you are not bothered by some bare cogwheels this is still a great toy! ---  --- It stands 2 feet tall to the top of the maze and is the perfect height for little ones.  The other 3 sides are: ABC with pictures rotating blocks, Abacus, Sliding plastic pegs.  The only side with stickers is the cog wheels so no worries about other sides losing stickers. ---  --- If they had made the cog wheels out of wood or had the design painted or imprinted into the plastic this toy would be a 10
I AM A PREDIABETIC PERSON.  THIS PRODUCT HELPS KEEP MY SUGAR UNDER CONTROL. MY NUMBERS ARE GREAT AFTER I EAT THIS CEREAL
I really enjoyed the first issue. Sure, it is about high end products. However, this mother is happy to find an alternative to pastels and Winnie the Pooh.
We bought this cargo bag for a 900 mile trip from Pennsylvania to Florida. We didn't use it on the way there, but on our way home, we put two medium sized suitcases in it.  We barely made it 100 miles before the bag started coming unglued at the seams.  Fortunately (or unfortunately due to the color), we had a bright yellow roll of duct tape with us, so we were able to repair the bag as we drove.  After another 100 miles, we had to stop again and repair the bag.  We drove from Florida to Hilton Head, having to stop three times to repair the bag with the bright yellow duct tape.  From Hilton Head to Pennsylvania, the bag started to look like a nightmare of black, criss-crossed with yellow.  The last leg of our trip was nothing but a hassle, having to stop to fix the bag.   ---  --- The company has a 30 day return policy, but we missed that by a day, having ordered it two weeks before our trip and being gone for two weeks, and they wouldn't even work with us on it.   --- 
I absolutely LOVE these paci keepers and highly recommend them.  They are the only ones that my son doesn't manage to rip off of himself.  I got so tired of trying to reach over the backseat to find a dropped paci while my son was in a rear-facing car seat.  That made for a horrible trip.  I purchased these and they are awesome!
not my favorite of their products. The rasins are Hard and sometimes Burnt, it takes to long to soften.
This item arrived 1 week early.  I took it out the box and it was already assembled.  It is so sleek and extremely comfortable.  It is a great addition to my patio.  The price was reasonable and it had free shipping.  You can't beat it!!  I want another one
From the cover, this movie looked like a fun mixture of Cruel Intentions and Metropolitan. No such luck. I think the biggest problem in this movie was the script-- the writing was so bad that it was actually painful to listen to the dialogue. Though there are some normally fine actors in this cast, it would have been impossible to triumph over the poor script, and the cast as a whole seemed strangely void of emotion, except for a few moments of melodrama. I found myself hating even the characters we were supposed to sympathize with. Delilah, who is supposed to be the "fun, crazy" outsider, simply disgusted me with her actions at the movie's central party. Even the art direction in this movie was strange-- many pivotal scenes in the movie were shot from very far away. The strangeness of this movie is not intentional, it's just lack of skill. Stay away
I'm not an expert on footballs, but I haven't seen anything wrong with the way this one is performing.  It's easy to grip and throw, and it doesn't have that cheesy "hey I'm a recreational football" look to it.  Good deal for the money
My wife purchased this for me as a Christmas present.  It started displaying pixels on the screen after about 2 months.  I've called Digital Spectrum, sent faxes and emailed them.  This has been going on for nearly a month.  A real waste of money & my time
If you have this book, keep using it for the review only, but not for the tests. I suggest, use 15 Tests of Meylani for the practice
The battery is great and it's pretty nice to own two of these, so when one battery --- is discharged I can just pop in the spare.   ---  --- It was in stock and delivered to me in a reasonable amount of time
 I won't dispute Emmylou's wonderful voice and Mark Knopfler's superb guitar playing but this album just didn't cut it for me. Pretty lame, about as likely as Hank and Phoebe Snow
I bought this watch for my 5 yr old and though it works just fine, the watchband is WAY too big for him.  Fortunately, I am handy with a sewing machine and was able to take a pinch in the band, but it makes it bulky and uncomfortable.  Therefore, he only wears it in bed so that he can play with the indiglo feature in the dark.  As soon as he gets up in the morning, though, he takes it off.  
I'm not a Spider-Man fan.  I love POWERS, THE ULTIMATES, SUPREME POWER, PLANETARY and other stuff by Warren Ellis, Brian Michael Bendis, et.al.  So when I bought this, I wondered if spending a whopping $49 would be worth it.     ---  --- I wanted to read Straczynski's recent run of Spider-Man, but if I was going to spend about $20 on a graphic novel, why not spend a little more for the whole thing.  And that's just what you get.  In addition to getting Straczynski's 4-year run (which includes Spider-Man's evolution and discovery of his totemic powers), you get everything leading up to JUNE 2006 (which is just like 3 issues ago!).  And all on 1 DVD-ROM.   ---  --- True, the Cons are that when it comes to Crossovers, you only get the Amazing Spider-Man stories and reading it off your computer isn't as fun as reading the actual comics -- but that doesn't compare to getting the entire run.  It's like complaining about getting a free PS3, XBox360 AND Nintendo Wii, because the box didn't come with it or you're missing one controller.   ---  --- $50 may seem steep, but if comics cost $3 now, so for the price of like one or two months worth of comics -- or for 2 books, you get everything.  And it's true, you can just print out the pages if you want (so if you want to abuse your office or school's printer, go for it!
I tried this snack tonight and it was all I could do not to eat the whole bag.  Well, the night is young so I probably will.  I love the flavors and the spiciness of it
It takes some getting used to, but once you do you will love it.  It leaves my teeth cleaner than any toothbrush, electric or other, that I have ever used.  You feel at first like it is totally strange (it is!).  Doesn't take more than a few times using it to realize that it's a great concept and so much faster than anything else. ---  --- I have no buyers remorse.  I Just wish that changing the brushes on it were simpler so one brush could be shared with another person.  You really are best to have one per person with this one since changing the brush a lot is a hassle
If you're like me - middle-aged, white, male, conservative, Christian, who buys most of my clothes at Old Navy - you will be the target of all the condescending ridicule in every article.  And yet I find it very entertaining!  Although I'll never be able to afford even one of their recommended outfits, and I'm usually a full 180 degrees opposite of their political views, I find their articles interesting, well-written, and insightful.  I must admit, I should hate Esquire, because the editors and writers would find me disgusting.  But somehow I look forward to seeing it in my mailbox every month.  The writers, if nothing else, are intelligent, which is more than I can say for the writers in most guy magazines like FHM and Maxim
always soft and semi-sweet, real apples, tastes kinda like a muffin without any air in i
I purchased this to put on the changing table.  I was looking for something that would fit on top of the table next to the changing mat and would hold diapers, wipes, lotions,etc.  I purchased and returned two other baskets for various reasons then I found this one.  It fits perfectly and holds the wipes container, several diapers, lotion, hair brush, etc.  I love that it has separate pockets to hold small items so that they dont fall over.  This allows everything to be within easy reach while changing the baby.  The price was also reasonable.  I was looking at buying one from Pottery Barn for twice the amount.  This basket is a great buy
This monster is great...my old millionaire nan came over recently to tell us that she was about to take us out of her will because we had too much money already, and as luck would have it she had to use the bathroom during that same visit. We heard this scream from the bathroom and when we broke in we found our nan dead on the floor...luckily she hadn't gone to her attorney's office to sign the new will and we got our share after all...thanks toilet monster..you were worth the $15 + $5 shipping we paid for you
This is a beautiful piece. Very substantial and unusual! The only thing that would have made it better is if it had been made with a bigger bail so it could accommodate larger chains than the neckwire it comes on. Regardless, it was well worth the price
Just used this razor for the first time.  Could not get a close shave out of it at all.  The trimmer will cut hair but not stubble.  On top of all of this it gave me a pretty bad gash.  I'm very disappointed in this razor but I guess I got what I paid for.  I'm going to order a new razor right now because I can't stand to shave with this one any longer than necessary
Monster cables have superior construction and always deliver the best quality sound and video.  They cost a little more but i found mine on amazon cheap and got free shipping.  Saved $20 over retail and got shipment within 3 days.  I'm happy
 --- I've always read lots of books about singles and how to find a mate, and that rate has sped up since I'm now a Romance Coach.  But somehow I had missed Susan Page's "If I'm So Wonderful, Why am I Still Single?" even though it has been out since 1998, the last year I was single myself.  Where have I been, and why hadn't I seen this book? ---  --- Susan Page writes for "involuntary singles" -- straight, gay, male or female, each and every one of us who is single and wishes we weren't.  Relentlessly positive, she starts off right to the point with "So why are you still single anyway?"  And then, just when we've gotten over that shock, she states flatly:"Whatever your reasons are for being single, if you want to be in a relationship, no reason is good enough."  Then Page goes about tearing apart every good reason we've ever come up with to keep ourselves single. ---  --- Here's what Page takes on and turns around: Ambivalence (my favorite), those "Dreadful Statistics," the myth of "There are no good ways to meet people," and having and keeping high standards.  Then she works on developing skills in what she calls "Frog kissing":  Learning to say no, how to recognize true intimacy, avoiding "commitmentphobes," handling the intimacy gap, and learning to say "yes."  And in the last section, "Keeping It All Together While You Look," Page tells you just how to do all that.   ---  --- This is easily the best, most thorough, rounded and positive book about relationships and dating I have seen.  If you are one of Page's "involuntary singles," this book needs to be in your library.  Five chocolate dipped strawberries for Susan Page!  This is quite a book.   
I bought my K10D in Dec 06 after owning a number of Pentax cameras over the years and being very pleased with the engineering. The combination of features, if executed properly, make this camera the best buy in 10MP DSLRs right now.  I postponed my review because I wanted to get some real field experience.  I just went to Mexico, and panicked because I left the camera instruction manual behind.  I can now report on that trip. I did a little fumbling at first, mainly because I didn't have the manual, but I was soon able to find the combinations I wanted, and the camera performed both flexibly and intuitively.  The AF button and the exposure compensation button are very well placed.  I found myself in difficult lighting situations often, and both AF and exposure metering worked quite well.  I also took some hand-held shots that I normally would use a tripod with (such as at 450mm), and very few came out fuzzy because of camera movement.  In a few cases, I used bracketing, and was easily able to obtain a good balance of details in one or more of the bracketed shots.  Exposure metering worked so well that I stopped bracketing.  I particularly liked the display modes: I could boost the brightness to see the display even in bright daylight, and deep zooming gave me a good check of whether a shot was "soft" or not right at the scene.  The rechargeable Li Ion batteries, although not readily available in stores, seem to last forever (even using power zoom, and full-bright display, and some fill flash).  I believe that I could have shot all week (700 shots in RAW (DNG) + JPEG) with the battery grip attached. In summary, this camera was a pleasure to hold, very easy to use and manipulate, and resulted in a high percentage of crisp photos (even if the percentage of well-composed shots was lower because of the photographer).  I bought it because of its compatibility with Pentax lenses, 10MP sensor, shake-reduction technology, larger display, and especially the dust and water seals.  But what makes me quite happy about it is its overall ease of use and good results.  I am still discovering its features, but I already know that this camera frees me to be creative in ways that other cameras have not in the past.  Some of the features on this camera are unique (new program lines) and some are available only on cameras costing several hundred dollars more, making the K10D a good choice and a best buy.  Once again for Pentax, the engineering is supurb.  
Keeps perfect time and looks great on the outdoor wall of my patio.  A classy looking clock
As a very frugal spender, I had observed this new design of coffee making in the stores and thought the process made sense - so I was ecstatic to receive an email of a promotion one day, I drove many miles to save some bucks and continue to be pleased beyond belief with every new kind of coffee we try.  We didn't like the competing cheaper brands but we find Douwe Egbert's Senseo brands consistently delicious.  The flavors are subtle enough that we don't feel we're drinking a cup of chemicals.  If you like strong coffee, then stick to the 4 oz per pod suggestion.  If that seems strong or bitter, we find we can get 2 or 3 more ounces from the pod and be very pleased.  For the first time in my 30 year marriage, my husband doesn't make a point of commenting on the delicious coffee everytime we eat out - finally we have predictable great coffee at home.  Being able to serve guests their choice of tea, flavors, or caffeine and have everyone enjoy the first cup out is  a wonderful benefit
Excellent product.  Really protects you.  My dermatologist recommended this product and although it's more expensive - it's worth the protection for your skin.  I'm glad my children are using it
My buddy died wearing this mask.  Well he didn't die but he lost his eye.  The mask got hit in the mesh and broke and all in his eye.
I live in the UK and Amazon doesn't allow me to download ANY off the NCIS shows. This service should be open to all amazon users......!!!!!!
This lifts your heart to God as you listen.  Beautifully done
This magazine is by far the best food, travel magazine out.  A bit on the expensive side due to it coming from BBC in England but worth every pound...dollar
 this gun is not good. it is a piece of crud. beginners could buy a gun thats about 100 times better from walmart for only 20 bucks. get it if your a idiot. i wish i could give it 0 star
I still have not received this item, not sure what is going on ?  If you have any answers I would love to hear about it?  Thank
My husband and I got these headphones for his 9-year old son who lives in Ocala, Florida. He loves them. They aren't too heavy, and really allow him to listen carefully. When a 9-year old can concentrate on something for longer than five minutes, you know it's a good product! They took some getting used to, but after three weeks, he's doing very well, and doesn't even notice that he has them on
I have been using computers since DOS 5.0 and this is by far the most user friendly, comprehensive, and powerful operating system I have used so far.  Aside from Linux, if you are interested in an easy to use, dynamic OS go with XP professional.  It has lots of features that are always coming in handy.  Unless you wanna go crazy and are an IT Power User (in which case Linux), go with this OS.  Its great
My sons got this toy for their 1st birthday since their physical therapist recommended getting a push/ride on toy with a wide base for learning to walk.  While they enjoy the buttons and sounds and like being pushed around on it, I do not find it helpful for development.  The handle pushes forward and comes off very easily, it is not heavy enough for them to pull up on without tipping over onto them, and the seat is very wide and square so their legs will have to grow considerably before they would be able to ride it.  Also some of the stickers are starting to peel off and we've only had it a month.  For an older child it would probably make a decent ride on toy, but if you are wanting a push toy to help with early walking, keep looking
Great for filling the doctors office magazine selection - if it's free - but not worth your money to own. I bought if for gardening inspiration and there is really nothing about gardens or gardening in here. Oh, once in a while they remember to put a garden shot in the magazine, but not consistently. The home section isn't that inspirational either. Go for it if it's free, but if it's not, don't buy it
I bought this band in two strengths. It is advertised as "99.998% free of soluble proteins and latex allergens" and powder free and it is neither. I used them and got a skin reaction to latex which I would not have if it was only .02 % latex. ---  --- Customer service was helpful when I called.
I have to agree with the guy who complained about consistency.  I have wasted two very expensive pods so far.  The first time I used a Kona pod the machine jammed and I could not open it for 24 hours,(caused a steam lock), about 5 tablespoons of undrinkable crap came out of my senseo.  The next time I tried a Kona pod I got a quarter amount of what should have been a two cup try. I am not very impressed so far.  I am now afraid to try again.
I'll admit it. The first three or so Cheetos actually taste pretty good. However, each one seems to taste worse, for some reason. And then there's the despicable Cheeto dust... You get that stuff on your fingers, and you're forced to either wipe it on something, (gross) or thoroughly lick it off your fingers (gross). I detest snacks with sticky dust crap. This stuff is the worst offender
The battery which "popped up" with my camera order does NOT match the camera.  Thus I am stuck with the hassel of returning a battery.  I was leaving for a trip when it arrived and so I had to go out and buy a replacement after it arrived. 
Why Should I buy anything from Amazon when they Allow Price Gouging by third-party retailers
It worked well with my vx8300. However I already had a driver that I knew worked so I did not use the disc. So I cannot comment on the driver disc
I bought a copy for a friend recently and she said "His music sounds so fresh and it's so singable.  The lyrics are meaty, too, not just fluffy pop. I'm kind of obsessing over this music right now--which is fun!  Thanks so much... I'd like to see him in concert sometime." I had this album for a year before I really got into it, since it takes a couple of listens to really appreciate.  At first listen I really liked We'll Do It All Again, and put it onto my MP3.  A year later I finally got the album out again and it bleu me away.  I realize that there is something slightly Barry Mannilowish about We'll Do It All Again, because he has some lungs, not because of style or anything.  He reminds me more of Jellyfish, or They Might Be Giants.  Some songs are so pathetic, vulnerable, and a little too honest for comfort as far as lyrics go, but they are energetic and hopeful in their delivery.  Anyone who appreciates art for arts sake will probably like this album.  The songwriting is superb and precisely produced. The second hidden track is a real gem, that you don't need to relate to in order to appreciate.  The lyrics are clever and fun even though several songs have a theme of loneliness.
This jacket is wind and water resistant, but not waterproof.  I was soked through after first rain. I use it mainly for wind block while biking now
  This album sends mixed messages to the listener.  Some tunes are overally happy, some quite depressing. I can only explain it in parts: ---  --- Radio Song - the first track of the album comes out quite upbeat and rollicking.  A guest vocal from KRS-One makes it quite a lively tune.  Puts you in the mood for a more Green-style album. ---  --- Losing my Religion - Huh? What's this? The album delves into uneasy angst as a troubled Stipe spills problems out to the listener.  The tortured riff holds out until the end, telling the listener this isn't quite like Green or Document... ---  --- Low - The depression lingers on.  Low is a tune sadened speech about the absence of love and how it can make you feel so low.  My favorite on the album, I think it's delicate and sad.  My #1 downer tune. ---  --- Near Wild Heaven - Another uneasy tune that has a touch of angst.  Deals with the apprehension of love. ---  --- Endgame - A curious tune.  Can't be interpreted either happy or sad, for it is instrumental.  It could go either way, it's written in a major key, yet the melody sounds sobered, almost as if it's a requiem. ---  --- Shiny Happy People - Takes the listener up to a very uncomfortable level of happiness.  A low point on the album, yet I interprate it by feeling uneasily happy after the anti-pastorial earlier tracks. ---  --- Belong - One track I don't understand, yet enjoy and see it as a break from the main goal of the album. ---  --- Half a World Away - Ah, so beautiful.  Essentially about enjoying life's finer moments at the expense of moments to come.  Truly happy, but still holds on to the softcore angst. ---  --- Texarkana - The lyrics and pulsing bass line make me draw conclusions that it's about unfulfilled life goals.  Delves deeper into seeds of depression until... ---  --- Country Feedback - The climax of saddness on the album.  This song is excruciatingly sad.  The melody, the lyrics... It kept me awake all night.  One of the saddest songs I've ever heard. ---  --- Me in Honey - A powerful, joyous ending that basically sums up the fact the everything turns out OK in the end. ---  --- This album is highly recomended.  R.E.M. are an incredible band. ---  --- 
They are very nice and comfortable. I just advise ordering a size larger than you are used to
Having spent several months trying to find the cookies in our area to no avail located them through Amoazon, ordered them during the Holiday Season  --- had a very quick respons and were able to have them for Christmas Day. --- I just can't beleive how quickly We received the cookies without one being broken
I have a wide, relatively short foot with a high arch and have lots of problems finding high quality dress shoes that fit.  Bostonians are the only quality shoes that fit me, so I have been loyal for the last decade.  I can't find them in my area, so Amazon is the only channel I use to get them
Unless you buy the multi arcade machines with all the major games including Mr. Do and do it right- the classic collections on PlayStation II are the best.  Unfortunately for plug and play some of the versions are jerked to very difficult levels and not as fun to play.  The monsters in the Pac-Man games are almost always on kill including following you  in the tunnel a lot of the time.  The problems listed with the joystick seem to be accurate.  Galaga was better and Mappy was a lot of fun to play- the most underated classic in arcade history.  But again it's better to get the collections for Playstation II
This is not your father's business magazine. Picked it up for the first time in a doctor's office and stole the issue (on real estate)
This one has one of those touching endings where you get to see that even Booth has a heart...well, more so than we already know.  The ending got me, I got misty over it.  Enjoy with someone you love
I AM STILL NOT RECEIVING THIS MAGAZINE.  AND I HAD A GIFT SUBSCRIPTION ON THAT ORDER, TOO.  I'VE BEEN MEANING TO GET IN TOUCH.  THOUGHT IT HAD BEEN MORE THAN LONG ENOUGH FOR SUBSCRIPTION TO START
  we purchased this monitor based on other great reviews.  I would have to say that it does work well.  The only issue we had was that it only worked on one channel for it to have clear reception from my daughters room to our master bedroom.  Also on that channel if it was on and the cordless phone rang it had a large amount of static and you would have to turn off the monitor.  It has given me peace of mind that I don't have to run in every sound she makes. I can look in on the monitor and see if she really does need me.  I would recommend this product
I was using CA but they dropped Zone Alarm and I was having issues.  PC-Cillin has my computer safe again.  I love that it is 3-user
I had tried this for my newborn and I think this product is unsafe and not sturdy.  The base of the seat is very wobbley, it would help to have suction cups on the bottom.  And  you do have to fill your tub about half way in order for your child to stay warm.  Also, when I put my baby in the seat and he is 12 lbs, the seat tipped backwards.  I can imagine that it would be worse when my child is heaviear and moves around more.  I do not think this product is safe.  It would make a great product if they included a baby tub with it.  So I returned the product and ended up with the 4-in-1 bath station from Safety First that worked well with my first child
Layla is one of the most overrated songs of all time. Cream is one of the most boring bands in history. Why not do yourself a favour and buy enjoyable bands like Dire Straits, and Metallica --- who rock. ---  --- PS.This Clapton compilation has no good songs so please don't --- buy it at all
This was a  very tender jerky. It's not the kind that wrenches at your teeth. If you're looking for hard-core jerky, look elsewhere. ---  --- Back in my youth, I used to love that sort of thing. But with the sensitive teeth I have now, I need to show a little discretion. This jerky was great. It was tasty. It had a little heat which I appreciated. The only drawback were the spice. There's something really hard in the spice mix that nearly broke my teeth on more than one occasion. ---  --- There's 2 bags, but it went fast. It was that good
Digital photography is a fast-moving target, and this book manages to keep abreast of the latest changes with valuable information that's vital for anyone doing digital photography.  It explains all the key concepts clearly and completely, with lots of advice on getting the best photographs with any type of digital camera.  I would have liked additional coverage of digital SLRs, but I have found that elsewhere, and still prefer Complete Digital Photography's treatment of the broader topics
This so called treasure is not a treasure at all .... a big disappointment
After subscribing to Natural Health for years, the magazine recently "went to the dogs". I now subscribe to Alternative Medicine instead and it is like Natural Health USED to be. I love it. The information is accurate and the topics are all very interesting
Coming out at the same time as Ken Russell's rather more amusing Valentino, The World's Greatest Lover suffers from Gene Wilder's sporadic tendency to mistake the grotesque for the side-splitting. Thus we get the odd huge close-up of mouths covered in shaving foam and a lot of tiresome hysteria and tongues. We also get far more of Dom DeLuise mugging away as if semaphore were back in fashion than is strictly necessary, though he's not as OTT here as in Sherlock Holmes' Smarter Brother, for which we can at least be grateful. Unfortunately, we get much more of Wilder's tendency to mistake hysteria for the hysterical - when in doubt, shout seems to be his motto - with Wilder adding a nervous tic that sees him stick out his tongue when he gets nervous. And he gets nervous a lot. Be still my aching ribs... ---  --- It's a reworking of Fellini's near career killing early flop The White Sheik, even including a Felliniesque lineup of hookers at a bus stop in one scene, only without Fellini's restraint (yes, you did read that right), with Wilder's unemployed baker heading for Hollywood to enter a screen test to find the next Valentino while his young wife seeks out the real thing. Wilder does acknowledge the debt in a screen credit that's part thank you to `my friend', but seems more name-dropping in a film that comes across as something of a vanity project - certainly with Wilder starring, writing, directing, producing and even writing a song for the film, it's fair to say where the buck stops on this one. One of those films that at once offers fairly lavish period production design but often a complete lack of understanding of silent cinema - yes, we do get sped-up comedy scenes - it's definitely pre-Kevin Brownlow's Hollywood, which completely destroyed most of the then-common myths about silent cinema that this embraces. Indeed, anachronisms abound, with the feel (and the songs) often more Thirties than Twenties, which perhaps wouldn't matter quite so much if it were all funnier. It's not a total disaster - there's the odd good line (a conductor announcing "Hollywood, home of the stars and several featured players"), a nicely natural performance from Carol Kane before she became a mess of mannerisms to rival Wilder and it does offer a once-in-a-lifetime chance to see James Hong playing a Norwegian (or is it Svedish?) studio executive, complete with excellent accent. (Also to be glimpsed among the bit parts in the supporting cast are Danny De Vito as an assistant director, Billy Sands - Paparelli in Sergeant Bilko - as a studio guard and, as the boss of a bakery, David Huddleston, here billed as `Michael Huddleston's Father'!) ---   --- Fox's DVD offers a decent 1.85:1 widescreen transfer as well as a fullscreen version, with optional original mono or remastered stereo mixes. Aside from the theatrical trailer and trailers for three other Wilder films (Young Frankenstein, Sherlock Holnes' Smarter Brother and Silver Streak) the only extra is an audio commentary by Wilder that is so sparing and uninformative that you'll wonder if you clicked the wrong button on your menu
The USB cable and software did NOT work for the Sony Z525A phone, purchased through Xcingular. The phone will NOT connect to the pc. The phone does indicate that it is charging through the cable. Uninstalled the software and tried again, with firewall shut off. Same result. Connecting a USB device should NOT be this difficult.  
 --- PRO + Great story, teriffic acting, beautiful setting --- CON - Some pacing flaws, but not enough to destroy the whole ---  --- Lindsay Duncan is perfectly cast as the guardian of this endangered photographic archive and Liam Cunningham is her well-cast, perfunctory foil. As as the story unfolds, the differences between British and American style (and culture) are revealed, providing a nice subtext to the plot.  ---  --- One of the viewing pleasures is in discovering that not everything is as it appears, from the central story to the character's lives. Good actors all. But my "best actor" award goes to the photographs themselves: the stories they tell and the feelings they evoke are haunting and captivating all at once.  A visually rich film
We paid for a 12 month subscription and I got the magazine for about 4 months. I couldn't get anyone to answer why it stopped and basically they just took my money. I didn't get a 12 month subscription. I got ripped off. ---  --- Plus when I did get the issues they are very poor paper quality and the covers and some of the pages were always ripped and bent up. Very disapointing...
Maybe it helps to be unfamiliar with Chekov's work and therefore have no preconceived notions, but I found this British made drama to be absorbing and quietly powerful in depicting the sadness and futility of pre-revolution Russia. The story of a once wealthy family slowly accepting their loss of prestige and slendor blooms like a beautiful but lonely rose, and thankfully the depths of the drama never get very sloppy, sentimental, or even tragic
Attila was a 2001 mini series which won the honor of being the most watched mini-series of its day. It features a stellar cast including Powers Boothe as a crafty Roman leader who tries to use Attila to gain possession of Rome. ---  --- Gerard Butler is Attila, the Hun,and he is everything about Attila in this role, never was an actor better suited. His character is sharp, passionate, determined and has an instant magnatism that keeps the viewer glued to the film. He brings a strong intensity and subtle gentleness to the character which makes watching him clash with Boothe even more dynamic. ---  --- This is a definite watch for anyone that likes period piece drama or just really well staged war scenes
The tea was good, But I was looking for a box to keep around for a while and the felt lining hardly hides the fact that it's a cheap particle board box
The game seemed to start off like any other Nancy Drew game.  My daughter has played them all.  However, after a while, it seemed as thow it was an easter egg hunt for three year olds.  Everything was easy to find and not mysterious at all.  All the other games took my daughter quite some time before she figured out the mystery.  However, this game took her two days.  All the other Nancy Drew games kept her intrigued and kept her coming back for more.  This game breezed by and and she was quite disappointed.  In fact, her words at the end of the game were, "that's it?".  Her interactive, better come out with a more interesting game next time or you'll lose the interest
I bought one of these when they first came out, because we have very hard water and I HATE shammying my car. The soap doesn't foam up like it would if you were bucket-washing, but it gets the car just as clean. I sort of like that it doesn't have a trigger device, as it avoids accidentally spraying the vehicle when you don't want to. Another plus is you don't have to wash your car with a bucket full of dirty water. The super-fast jet spray setting is not that useful for me, but I'm sure you off-roaders would appreciate it. I don't agree with the reviewer who said it causes more water spots. I don't think they used it right. If you wash your car pretty often, this kit comes recommended
My MV-50 just arrived tonight and it worked fine, it would have made sense if it had a cigarette adaptor than having to use the battery. The gauge starts off from zero and increments by 5psi, so it is off by 5psi! The gauge reads: 0,5,10,15,20,25. At 20psi, it is showing 25psi.   ---  --- The only confusion is what I found on the internet for some people paying only $25 for this and not $70 plus shipping charges. ---  --- The connector is not useful for tight spaces, like a rear motorcycle tire on my Yamaha 650 Maxim.  ---  --- I think it is going to perform to my racing needs. --- 
No problems. Like the small format bottle, easy to store. Works as well as anything else
My initial reaction to this magazine was that this magazine is huge, and full of ads.  I also read Vogue, though, and to be honest, W has less ads in it.  W convieniently avoids the snotty air of Harper's Bazaar and Vogue while at the same time avoiding the trashy how to sex up your man type articles in Cosmopolitan, Redbook, and Marie Claire, and it also avoids the rampant celebrity worship of InStyle.  This magazine has excellent layouts, and from what I've read thus far, excellent-and very different-stories.  As a regular Vogue reader, I'm used to reading about older designers like Coco Chanel, the Versace and Prada lines, and reading about a small smattering of socialites, like Aerin Lauder, Paris Hilton, Jemma Kidd, Victoria Traina.  What is different about W is that it profiles the new and the modern.  An article in the September issue profiled Kate Spade and her new line.  Other articles talked, almost sarcastically about the latest exploits of the socialites, meanwhile talking about, in an article aptly titled "A Bag Called It" the trend of statement purses and their proper place.  W is also similar to Vogue that in addition to the good layouts, it has even better photography, there are no Photoshopped to death photos in here, and if they are, this student can't find them.  What I like most about W is its sarcastic wit, something that is lost in most magazines, many of which these days assume that everyone wants to learn the latest way to sex up their man, worship Teri Hatcher, or read dumbed down articles. 
 this curry assortment is a great way to sample different curries at a very affordable price and curry pastes are a very quick and easy way to spice up almost any dish
I bought these for my 83 year old mom, she loves jewelry and helped me pick these out. We thought it would be a good deal for the price. She was happy with the look of the stones when they arrived, but as others have noted, these stones are mounted at the end of a rather deep mount (almost 1/4 inch) which makes them rather top heavy. Unless you have very thick and meaty ear lobes, these earrings are going to droop downwards, not sit pretty on your ear as you would expect. Needless to say, my moms ear lobes are very thin, as soon as she put them in her ears, they drooped downward at a 45 degree angle. She was very displeased with these and we sent them back for a refund
I quite liked this trimmer while it worked well, so I'm disappointed at how it has held up through only a little over six months.  As of now the battery will hold barely any charge, if at all.  It's frustrating to have it crap out on me after initially being pleased with its functions
I believe this is one of the best lens for about $1000. Forget about zoom lenses even if they are L. This lens is far better than 70-200L in my opinion. It is very sharp at f2 and even more sharp at f2.5. With zoom lenses you have to set to f/5.6 for better result and f/8 to match this lens. It is very well built but not excessive heavy, come with hood and bag, but unfortunately, Canon have decided to remove the hard cases for all the L lenses. ---  --- Combined with a Tamron 1.4X teleconverter this lens provide very good optical quality on par with any zoom L lenses at 189mm focal length. Yes I know I lost the convenience of a 70-200 zoom lens. But I am really happy that I decide to change the plan of buying a 70-200IS to 135/2L+1.4X. This not only saves me the money but also let me to get better pictures, especially at wide open. Better portrait lenses, like 200/1.8 and 300/2.8, would cost several thousands of dollars. Trust me, once you play with primes, you will not like zoom anymore. ---  --- I am also using a 24-70L to shoot my small kid. After using this lens, I don't like it anymore and thinking about change to primes someday, the only reason preventing me doing that is the 1.6X crop factor of digital camera. A 35mm/1.4L will become 56mm which is really not good. ---  --- Order from Amazon with free shipping even though it says not in stock. They shipped mine in 2 days and this happened before even though item stated "in stock soon". ---  --- Pros: --- Very sharp at f2 and super sharp start from f2.5. --- Very fast lens with f/2 --- Very good bokeh (background blurring). --- Overall extremely good picture quality with good contrast/color. --- Smaller size, less weight and black color compare to those white 70-200s. --- It is a L lens: best build quality, fast/quiet ring USM AF with FTM. ---  ---  --- Cons: --- No hard case. --- No inexpensive. --- Effective focal length is 216mm on 10D/20D/Rebel/300D which is a little difficult to use for portrait
"Those who write well have more power and therefore have more control over their lives" (p.21).  If this is indeed true then Mem Fox is a very powerful woman!  In the midst of the phonics vs. whole language war being raged in the media, this book is a call for reading and writing teachers to examine their practices and strive for truly purposeful, artful teaching.  Fox's insights into her life as a writer, teacher and mother make this a truly inspiring and intensely challenging read.  I have always believed that to be an effective reading teacher, I must be a reader, able to share my passion for books with my students, but Mem Fox points out that unless I am a writer as well, I will be unable to know the difficulties, fears, hopes and needs of my students as writers.  I plan to thoughtfully explore the forms of writing I use, examine the writing process I go through and share my writing with my students on a more regular basis.  I am convinced that we will all grow from the experience!
They say 100% compatible but is not, because is not an info Ion-Litio, so is not a Eqivalent battery, dosn't work. Don't expend your money on this stupid batter
beware  - this is a spice mixture only, not actual harissa ---  --- Not what I intended to order, but the ad wasn't clear.  ---  --- Harissa as I ate it in North Africa was a pulpy mash of peppers and spices, some oil. Fantastic stuff. ---  --- I recommend Mustapha's Moroccan Harissa - it was terrific.
Eugene O'Neill's play "Long Day's Journey Into Night" is a Pulitzer award winning, autobiographical play about his family. I must admit that though Eugene O'Neill is considered by some to be the father of American Theater, I did not enjoy reading this play. The Tyrone family's insane dysfunction with their constant bickering and apologizing was very annoying and frustrating to read. I also disliked the fact that after four acts of continuous yelling and tension O'Neill offered no conclusion. The day in the life of the Tyrone family gets progressively worse until it finally peaks and the play just ends. No happy ending, no hope for the future, just despair. "Long Day's Journey Into Night" is a wholly depressing read that I really could have done without. However, after learning more about Eugene O'Neill's background, and the extent to which the play is based on his life, I began to have a greater appreciation for this play. O'Neill did lead a very hard life, therefore the frustration and despair I felt while reading this play demonstrates O'Neill's talent to engage his audience and to convey the emotions of the characters in a very real manner. While O'Neill's depressing end did not satisfy my craving for a happy ending, it was appropriate for the play as Eugene's own family never got a happy ending. I did like the clever way O'Neill showed the Tyrone family's desire but inability to forget their troubles through the dialogue. At the beginning of the play the audience is presented with a normal, loving family. The audience soon however, gets the suspicion that something isn't quite right, and that the family is tense. Slowly the family's skeletons are exposed through arguments between the family members, but the characters always feel regretful for bringing the subject up. Thus showing that no matter how hard the Tyrone family tries to pretend that all is well, their skeletons are always with them and resurface to continually remind them of the truth. Although I still believe "Long Day's Journey Into Night" to be thoroughly disheartening to read, the reader's emotional response to this play leaves no doubt to O'Neill's exceptional writing. 
I can't believe how great these are.  I bought these about 9 months ago and they were going to expire so I decided to try one. I feel amazing!!! I had lots of extra energy without the side effects of caffeine.  It tasted pretty good. 
I love this bra ... just the right amount of support.  Order arrived 4 days before expected ... woo hoo!!
The only reason I am rating this stroller a 1 is Amazon has it listed that is usable for a child up to 100 pounds.  It actually is only 50 pounds.  It is now being returned
The only thing I will say about the BDP-S1 is that it is top quality. --- Picture and sound quality are top-notch, but everything really depends on the software. ---  --- Now, if you are undecided about which camp to follow (Blu-ray or HD DVD), I'm here to tell you that Blu-ray will win. ---  --- You see, I have both Blu-ray and HD DVD. --- I have about 20 HD DVD movies and about 20 Blu-ray movies.  ---  --- In terms of picture and sound quality, they are the same, but it is completely dependant on the software. ---  --- But here is where the similarities end. ---  --- 1) Blu-ray is more durable.  --- The BD movie discs have scratch-resistant coating. They don't scratch unless you forcefully scratch them. --- On the other hand, the HDDVD movies scratch like heck. I put all of my movies in a CD case. I recently noticed that ALL the HDDVD movies are scratched, but NONE of the Blu-ray movies are scratched. These are stored in the SAME CD case by me. I am extremely careful. None of my movies even have a fingerprint on them. So when I see scratches on 100% of my HDDVD movies, that really upsets me!!!!! ---  --- 2) Blu-ray costs less to BUY. --- What? Superman Returns BD is $24, Superman HDDVD is $28. The Departed BD is $24, The Departed HDDVD is $28. --- Now the HDDVD DUAL format has both a standard DVD and HDDVD movie, but who in their right mind would want to buy an HDDVD to watch a 480p picture?  ---  --- Right now you can get a $500 PS3 or $400 Toshiba HDDVD player.  --- Later this year, Sony will come out with a $300 Blu-Ray disc player. HDDVD will most likely drop their prices. So the hardware will cost the same in both formats. ---  --- 3) Blu-ray has more capacity. --- For less money, you can get a 50GB Blu-ray movie versus a 30GB HDDVD movie. ---  --- And what if in 5 years they develope SUPER High-Definition 1920p picture and SUPER Hi-Def 8.1 DTS-HD Sound? What if this requires 75GB or 100GB? --- HDDVD can go up to 51GB. ---  --- Peace.
We found the program to be easy to install and the lessons easy to retrieve. The lessons are presented in a variety of ways to accomodate one's learning style.  The accompanying text is not difficult to understand and is very helpful in explaining the basics of the program. We appreciate the repetition and the spiraling effect used as one progresses through the lessons. So far, we are pleased with the materials and have felt quite successful in learning some basis phrases.
So far this seems to be an extremely effective (and inexpensive) way to store pictures captured with a multi-mega pixel digital camera. The sevice provided by this company shipping-wise was very fast. All-in-all a great deal
Compared to the "face out" belt clip I had previously, this "face in" version has proved to be a bit more stable and sturdy so far.  Hopefully, it will remain so.  For the price, it's not too hard to appreciate. 
My 9 month-old granddaughter likes her Christmas present of Octotune;  as a matter of fact, we played with this toy yesterday when I stayed with her.  It is colorful, she can grab the legs and the music is pleasing, so it stimulates more than one sense.
I love this DVD!  I took karate for awhile and was pleased to find that the correct form is really emphasized in the kicks and strikes.  Kathy Smith brings her enthusiasm and experience, and Keith Cooke and Kelley Roberts bring their knowledge of kickboxing in particular.  It's a great workout
wow, this really made a difference in my ability to create professional-looking comics. i have a graphics tablet and the drawing feel is  really good. i think my favorite feature is the tool for making Panels. Plus the tool for doing special effects lines, which is pretty sweet. ---  --- i just draw comics for fun, and for this price it is totally worth it. Manga Studio is perfect for publishing a webcomic or adding effects to existing drawings. ---  --- I would definitely recommend this software if you like to draw comics or manga
The bottom bolt broke a week after purchase, which prevents the unit from functioning as designed; it cannot swing out of the way
Im a truck driver that dosent drink coffee. Can you believe it!? --- My hours are really weird as my day may start at 8AM or at 8PM & I might work for 10 to 14 hours per shift. Ive used half a bottle to a full bottle at a time & have always gotten the boost I need to get where Im going. I also may use it to start my day or to finish it.  --- I started using 5 hour about 6 months ago. I dont use it everyday but when I need it, it works well. The nice thing is, when I finally call it a day I can lay down & get to sleep. Unlike other products Ive used, I dont have that ragged feeling afterward. --- I purchase in quantities of 100 & carry 25 or so on the road.
Seller was delivering immediately. The watch itself is sporty but elegant, suited for active men
I finally received this product in the mail after knowing about it for a year. I can't say I'm a huge fan of Deepak Chopra. He presents some good ideas, but from what I can tell he seems to consider meditation to be more of a mechanism for mind and body control, leading to bliss and relaxation, rather than a tool for unbiased self knowledge, to come to terms with all the things that one rather might ignore. I find this bias is reflected in the game. ---  As a game in itself, it is pretty good -  its graphics and its originality - and learning to relax and chill out may be useful for some people. I didn't find the process as compelling as I expected, though. I found I was able to learn some of the skills pretty fast, and other places I seemed to get stuck. One potential drawback is that if you get frustrated, and try to start forcing things to happen, it can defeat the purpose of meditation. --- The science of biofeedback is fairly new, and I can see its potential in the field of preventative health. I just wouldn't put the same New Age spin on things as Chopra does.
Very disappointed.  Purchased 6 of these for an 1100 sq. foot apartment to eliminate the common spider and occasional ants and insects that appear in the Spring and Summer time.  Well, I think these units INVITE the ants in.  We've never had more ants than we do now despite following directions to place these units on opposite walls in the same room, etc.  These devices do not phase them at all - they continue to parade right by
Toy makes EXTREMELY loud animal noises, along with a screeching motor when backing up or at top speed going forward.  My son enjoyed the heck out of it for about 2 minutes before my wife said it was going back to the store, which is exactly what I was thinking. ---  --- At least 3-4x louder than any other toy i've ever seen, let alone purchased. ---  --- Also when performing its "flip" maneuver, it gets stuck 70% of the time and then makes the same screeching motor sound while it repeatedly tries to reset its "flip arm". ---  --- Might be okay for just outside use if you can stand a lot of high pitched noise. ---  --- Controller was extremely toddler friendly compared to other RC toys.  Toy also seemed fairly tough.
Excellent for the every day driver. --- I got it as a gift, and bought 4 more for my family
I was shopping for a new lunchbox for my son and thought this might be good.  When it arrived it turned out to be much too large for a boy's lunchbox and more for a picnic box for 2-4 people.   I kept it anyway for picnic use and bought a smaller one for his lunch.  The Pranzo is great for a picnic but it is mislabled as a lunchbox
Maybe, just maybe, someone will buy one of these Stick Up Bulbs and maybe, just maybe, the bulb will last more than about 10 minutes of total use before it burns out. I thought to myself "buy another one because maybe this one was defective." I bought three more.....every time the tiny bulb burned out in minutes of use. It's a great idea....but a worthless piece of junk. The spare bulb? Useless as well.  ---  --- Don't waste a dollar on this junk. If I could have found the receipts I would have gotten my money back.
The Kyser capo is well designed. Normally "parked" on the head of my guitar, I can easily add, move or remove in 2 seconds. The unique feature of this capo is that you can flip it around, for example, cover the 3rd 4th and 5th strings on the second fret to convert it to an open E B A E B E tuning from a standard E B G D A E tuning. Very reliable and fun. Highly recommended
I have never eaten these, because well, they're not vegan. They are in amazon's vegan section however. Whey is not vegan it is the very first ingredient
First off let me state for the record that I only buy Sony , but I have to --- advise you against the purchase of the bean walkman. I purchased one in March 2006 and returned it September 2006, as I had purchased replacement --- insurance and was able to return it because it broke. It is hard to turn off and the usb port cover always pops open, not to mention the headphones --- always pull out. The FM receiver is hard tune in the daylight as the screen is invisiable. Save your self the hassel!!!!!
i'm a spanish fan of soul music of the 90's. --- these days is almost impossible to find a good soul/r&b cd to purchase.  --- In the 90's i had to buy about 2 or 3 cds per week. Now, with all the rap & hip hop topping the charts,what kind of music could i purchase?  LUTHER, ANITA, LALAH, SMOOTH JAZZ & maybe, some Joe's cd. AND OF COURSE, THIS TERRIFIC CD BY mr.BENSON. ---  --- If you're a fan of good r&b music and you hate the hip hop music, buy this cd NOW!!!!  You won't regret!
I needed a lens hood for my 50mm lens and paying $25 for a hood on a $75 lens might seem ridiculous. However, that might be because the $75 lens is so inexpensive. If the lens was $250 then paying an extra 10% might not seem too bad.  I just saw the total cost of the lens and hood for $100 and that's good for a terrific prime lens and its hood.   ---  --- However, please note: the lens hood is rather shallow (1 star reduction) and it is a screw-on two piece kit (1 star reduction). One piece is the adaptor that screws-on where the filters normally go (UV Filter) in front of the lens and is intended to be a permanent integral part of the lens and the second piece is the hood that snaps on and off this adaptor. The adaptor ring retains the same 52mm rim size so your protective filter can go before or after the adaptor. ---  --- (1 Bonus Star) Because $100 is still a bargain for a 50mm, f1.8, super fast, super sharp, super clear, light weight beginner lens and hood kit! ---  --- I hope this helps rather than confuse. :)
It is a great product for the price. The prep station has a good storage capacity and is easy to move around our deck because of the wheels. It was easy to put together too
this is one of those movies that you have to ask,"why remake a movie that did it right the first time!!! buy the 1968 version and forget this one! skip it!
I just used this product to wash my car and it worked great. As it is advertised, a little goes a long ways (1 oz per gallon). The suds feel very smooth and lifted dirt off my car with easy. It is also easy to rinse off. And after washing, my car's surface felt slick as well
I'm not sure how this toy ended up with a 4.5 star rating after all the broken microphones!! Ours was yet another that broke within 2 months of gentle play. It wasn't thrown or dragged around by the microphone or anything of the sort. My son loved it and figured out the microphone very quickly. He loved to see the lights and the little puppy "dance" when he "sang" into the microphone. I continued to let him play with it even after the microphone shorted out and the static began and he still kept trying the microphone until he got frustrated and then I finally put it away. I wish I had spent the money on something that would have lasted longer. My son is now 18 months old and the only other toy he has ever managed to break was the Vtech Nursery Farm which was broken 3 weeks after Christmas last year, just before this piano broke. I highly recommend Fisher Price or LeapFrog toys over Vtech. We have never had a problem with their toys and 2 of the 3 Vtech toys we have owned have broken on us. Garbage!
If you're worried about SIDS (loose blankets in the crib), or whether or not your little one is warm at night...look no more...HALO SleepSack Wearable Cotton or Fleece is the way to go!!!!  I love them, and know that my little guy is warm during those chilly nights
Sure I like a mystery- who doesn't? But when you a read a magazine like Hitchcock you end up losing faith in the short mystery story. The tales are hard-edged and lacking in style and substance. We seem to have a wealth of mystery writing talent but time and again Hitchcock Magazine is a disappointment. The value for money is horrible, the magazine is printed on newsprint paper and the ink just needs to be touched to smudge- Alfred Hitchcock would not be proud
Personally, I think if you are buying any sort of Razr for its "functionality" you are buying the wrong phone.  I have personally owned numerous LG phones and while they may not be as small, light, and attractive as Motorola phones, LG phones are built to last. However, if you are just looking for a cute phone that is easy to carry in your purse/pocket and to use just as a nice looking phone, this is a great one to own. ---  --- I previously had the LG VX9800 before I bought the pink Motorola Razr V3c.  I had the VX9800 because when I was in college I would text people constantly and use the AIM feature during boring classes.  That phone was incredible.  However, now that I am in the working world and basically only use my phone to call people, I wanted a phone that was easier to carry around and was "cute".  Enter the Razr.  I don't recommend this phone if your phone is your life--it doesn't do much.  However, if you are just going to be using it to make calls and send the occasional text, it's wonderful.  The pink color that Verizon put out is absolutely gorgeous--it's almost a purpley-pinkish lavendar color.  In my opinion, this pink is prettier than the T-Mobile magenta and much much much nicer than the Cingular pink (I am not a fan of that one at all). ---  --- In essence, if you're looking for a high-tech phone, this is not it.  If you're looking for a lightweight, attractive phone just to use for calls and some texting, this is a great buy
AFTER READING ALL THE HORROR STORIES, WE WERE LEARY TO PURCHASE BUT DECIDED TO WELL IN ADVANCE OF OUR CHILD'S BIRTH.  WE RECIEVED THE ARMOIRE WITHIN 2 WEEKS OF PLACING THE ORDER. IT WAS EASY TO PUT TOGETHER (LESS THAN 1.5HRS). THERE WERE SOME SCREWS MISSING FOR THE DOORS, BUT I CALLED STORCRAFT THE NEXT DAY, AND WAS IMMEDIATELY PUT THROUGH WITH NO BUSY SIGNALS.  THEY SENT OUT THE SCREWS AND I HAD THEM WITHIN 10 WORKING DAYS (THEY COME FROM CANADA).  IT IS BEAUTIFUL WITH NOT ONE NICK OR DING IN IT. WE'D RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE AS PART OF THEIR CHILDS NURSERY.  FYI - IT WAS NOT CHEAPER AT WALMART ONCE TAX AND SHIPPING WERE INCLUDED
I grill year round and in many weather conditions.  Unlike the gold and platinum grills, the silver grill does not have a carry handle to keep it shut for transport (see the review about the burnt down car), nor does it have the ability to prop the lid as a wind/rain shield.  The silver grill works fine in nice weather for fast, hot cooking, but if you want to grill in a drizzle or in a little wind, the ability to prop the lid up (available on the gold and platinum models) is essential.  I lost my gold grill.  Last night I tried cooking in a little rain on the silver grill, and it wasn't up to task like my gold grill was.  I'm going to buy a gold or platinum grill this time
When I got my SR60 I immediately put it on.  The headphones are comfortable and easily adjusted to my head.  I noticed that the foam had fairly large cells in it. My only previous experience with this type of foam has not been good, deeriorating very quickly but I am hoping that these will last longer.  The sound is quite clean and balanced.  As with most phones in this price range, there is a lack of base.  Had I been able to compare these side by side to the SR80, I may have paid the difference in price to get a bit more base.  Overall, I rate these as very good and are fairly priced
I had been looking at this particular watch for over a year and simply did not want to spend the money on it.  I found it at Amazon.com for half the price I had seen in department stores so I decided to buy it.  It is a fabulous watch.  I look forward to wearing it each day.  It looks great with really dressy suits or jeans and a top.  It is a great piece. 
VERY satisfied with the performance of this meter. Have been looking for a Relative Humidity meter for some time that was accurate and durable. The temperature is also included which is great. Price is VERY good for what you get !!
Don't buy this stroller. The only good thing about it is that you won't be sad if you leave it somewhere. The "restraints" don't restrain at all. My one year old twins barely stay in it so when we're in a store they can reach very far to pull down all sorts of things. (not safe) The stroller barely fits through regular door ways - and I mean barely fits. It does not maneuver well at all and is difficult to stear. The "adult drink cup holder" snaps off when struggling to go through doors and I don't have to describe what a mess that is. I'm just lucky I don't drink hot coffee; otherwise I would be suing the manufacturer for burns to the children. There is no storage. The "saddle bags" can hold a few small things but you should only use it for things you don't mind the children being able to reach. This stroller is not only a nuisance, it has potentially dangerous features, so please don't buy it
The reviewer below identifying himself as "An Electronics Fan" obviously has a deep bias against Bose.  His multiple reviews about Bose products--here and elsewhere--are transparently motivated by some animus against Bose.  Was he fired by Bose? Did a member of the Bose family reject his romantic advances?  Did a Bose executive accidentally run over his cat?  Did he drop a Bose speaker on his foot and hurt his toe? The true motivation for this guy's negative reviews would be fun to know.  In the meantime, what we do know is that he has no credibility, and his reviews (two here, others elsewhere for other Bose products; he's made maligning Bose his life's work, apparently)) should disregarded. ---  --- I bought a set of black 301's several years ago to go with my Onkyo receiver.  We have it hooked up to a television and DVD player for movies.  These speakers are in constant use both for the DVD and for music of all types.  The room in which they are placed is huge, with an 18 foot-high flat ceiling.  The speakers saturate the room with exquisite sound day after day. The speakers work fine for spoken audio for DVD's; we can hear dialogue perfectly; I feel no particular need for a surround-sound system. Several times my young daughters have turned on the 100 watt amp with the volume turned all the way up or close thereto. I feared a ruptured speaker cone, but the 301's are very forgiving, no damage has been done. The cats sleep on the speakers; they clean right up and still look new after five years.  These speakers keep on giving total satisfaction, and I quite simply love them. ---  --- About three years ago I decided to go all out in another room and bought the highest quality stereo stuff on the market, or at least what I determined to be best after a lot of research. This included a set of the gold-series tower speakers from Monitor Audio. (The speaker cones are metallic, with some amount of gold, and gold connections, etc., etc.) These Monitor Audios have to be the best looking speakers ever made (real wood veneer cabinetry, with the gold cones and the black covers, etc.). These speakers cost well over a thousand dollars each.  Well, I must confess, as awesome as the Monitor Audios sound, I can't really say they sound any better than the Bose 301's!!! They can maybe handle more power, but I assure you the Bose 301's will play loud enough to bring the cops to your doorstep in five minutes or less. ---  --- So, when I recently set up my third stereo in a bedroom, I looked forward to buying a third type of speakers.  I ran around and listened to what I could find on display.  Well, after much contemplation, I went for a second set of the Bose 301's!!!  They just couldn't be beat, and I would have gladly spent more if I had found something I liked better. But I'm not going to spend more just so I can say I spent a lot...there has to be increased performance. And, in my opinion, the 301's couldn't be out-performed by any other bookshelf speaker of any price range.  ---  --- My first set of 301's were black.  This time I went for the cherry. Folks, these are absolutely beautiful speakers: almost as cool looking as my Monitor Audios.  The black cover and the black housing fixture in the back really accentuate the cherry colored wood. No, it is not real wood, but it looks very nice.  These things are simply gorgeous. The kind of "mod" or futuristic shape which Bose has designed really stands out in this lighter-colored version.  And, yes, they sound just as good as my original pair.  I listen to soft music (jazz, typically, or ambient) in the morning and these speakers deliver all the nuances at very low volume; I listen to hard rock at high volume on other occasions, and the 301's don't scare away or distort at all: these things would tear the house apart before they'd lose sound quality. ---  --- So, yes, I recommend these highly.  They'd still be the speaker of choice for me at three or four times the price
I originally purchased the Logitech Mobile Freedom headset but when the clip that goes behind your ear broke, Logitech exchanged it for the Mobile Traveller.  ---  --- Unfortunately, this one is not comfortable at all. I agree with others that after 30-45 minutes, it feels like your ear is in a vise. It's true. It hurts. ---  --- Sound quality is very good. People say they can hear me just fine, and I can hear them just fine. ---  --- But it also disconnects with my cell phone when it is not in use. What good is that? Then when the phone rings, I don't hear it.  ---  --- Then the clip broke on this one as well. Logitech again replaced it. But how long will this one lsat?  ---  --- Do yourself a favor and skip this one
Relationships and drug use are major themes.  This album starts off with two absolute killer tunes, lets down some but has a joy thoughout.  I can't believe this is going to be his only album.....what a shame.  From someone who has been listening to rock for a long time, I tell ya, this is a blast.  Pure fun.  Something you might want to give to someone you have broken up with as its full of a broken heart and the joy of being in love.....mostly rather quickly paced.  One of my favorite albums of the 90s.  More people should listen
i love this movie.  it's picture perfect in a life of a tweeker and their enviroment. ---  --- WHERE IS THE SOUNDTRACK TO THIS MOVIE?????
For better or worse, after the relative box-office slump of ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE, producers Brocolli and Saltzman decided to woo Sean Connery back to do one more film for an amazing sum.  Connery, who had said he would never do another Bond film, donated all of his money to his own foundation.  While his performance is competent and smooth as ever, he seems all business.  No longer in love with the character and having realized long before that the character was stagnant, Connery mechanically works his way through DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER, an outright bore of the Bond series and, in my opinion, one of the worst (certainly Connery's worst).  While some have tried to save the film by arguing that it is a parody of the Bond genre, it plainly isn't.  It was an attempt to return Bond to his former glory days and generate profit for the producers.  Far from trying to lampoon the Bond formula, the producers were trying to resuscitate it.  And they failed.   ---  --- After the opening "gun barrel" sequence, we quickly find Bond on a personal mission to kill Blofeld once and for all after the death of Bond's only true wife (discounting the false marriage in YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE) in ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE.  (At least, this is what we must assume, since no mention of the marriage is made in DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER).  Bond catches Blofeld in the process of producing clones for himself in an underground laboratory and, after a couple of struggles with both Blofeld and a duplicate, Bond drowns Blofeld in a vat of mud.  It is a very short and quick opening teaser and immediately runs into the titles sequence.  The titles involves various diamonds, slowly revealed to be various pieces jewelry worn by beautiful women, all set to the title song sung by Shirley Bassey (who also sang the GOLDFINGER title).   ---  --- The plot of DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER is quite strange.  In an opening similar to GOLDFINGER, we learn that large quantities of South African diamonds have been smuggled recently and yet, surprisingly, have not made their way to the market.  Worried that the diamonds will be released in order to inflate the diamond market, Bond is sent in to infiltrate the smuggling operation, disguised as Peter Franks.  Bond quickly succeeds, meeting up with Tiffany Case (Jill St. John), an attractive diamond smuggler who is suspicious of Bond's identity.  Bond's mission is almost compromised from the start when the real Peter Franks makes an entrance, forcing Bond to fight him in a terrific elevator sequence that is reminiscent of the train fight in FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE.  After a smuggling attempt goes awry (thanks to Bond), Bond is discovered and learns of the real purpose of the operation he is infiltrating.  It turns out that Blofeld is behind it all (Bond killed only two duplicates in the opening teaser)!  Blofeld has been smuggling diamonds to create a laser satellite that is capable of destroying anything on Earth.  Blofeld has been hiding his operation by posing as recluse Willard Whyte (Jimmy Dean), whom he has secretly kidnapped unbeknownst to the world, and using Whyte's resources and industrial facilities to manufacture his powerful laser.  Blofeld plans to destroy various nuclear installations in America, Russia, and China.  The purpose?  Blofeld is organizing an international auction, offering nuclear supremacy to the highest bidder!  Will Bond be able to stop him in time?   ---  --- DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER feels like a film that was stitched together, rather poorly, from a myriad of interesting elements.  One feels that the producers had a bunch of ideas on the cutting floor and attempted to piece them together into a logical story order.  The infiltration of a smuggling ring, the wonderful fight sequence in the elevator, the quirky and gay hitmen Mr. Wint (Bruce Glover) and Mr. Kidd (Putter Smith), a not-so-subtle rendition of the famous Las Vegas recluse Howard Hughes, a fight on an oil rig, et cetera.  All of these elements are fairly interesting in their own right, but the combination doesn't yield what the producers were hoping for.  What is it about this film that feels so ridiculous?  One of the major problems, in my opinion, is situating Bond in Las Vegas.  Bond in America is dull.  His class, wit, and sophistication are only cheapened when placed in the cheesy context of Las Vegas in the 1970s.  Bond is supposed to take us to exotic locations--not to a strip club.  Furthermore, the action is not quite on par with the rest of the series.  I think everyone will agree that the chase scene in which Bond escapes through the desert on a moon buggy is absurd.  The chase is boring, the buggy looks ridiculous and prop-esque, and there is no suspense.  The climactic fight on the oil rig is equally boring.  Sure, we have a big set and big explosions.  But there is no cutting edge stuff here.  ---  --- Connery, as mentioned, looks very tired here.  Tiffany Case is a bit refreshing, but quickly becomes dim-witted and dull.  And the Bond girl with the clever name, Plenty O'Toole (Lana Wood) is only in the film for all of five minutes.  Blofeld is now played by Charles Gray, who first made his appearance as Bond's Japan contact in YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE.  Gray's performance takes Blofeld back to the ridiculousness of YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE, even appearing in drag at one point.   There isn't much more to say.  The acting is dead in DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER.   ---  --- Now, some have tried to defend DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER by claiming that the film is an outright attempt to make a parody of the Bond genre.  After producing six Bond films, the producers were ready to lampoon their own creation and move Bond into the Roger Moore pun-fest the series would eventually become.  While this certainly seems to create an outlet for the film, it seems plainly false.  If you watch the "Making of" documentary on the Ultimate Edition, it is clear that everyone thought they were making a real Bond flick and not a parody.  The producers were trying to bring the series back to its former glory days and to produce big box-office success.  They were not trying to create a subtle piece that exposed the hilarious features of the Bond formula.  Anyone claiming otherwise is just engaging in wishful thinking and rationalization.  This film stinks.  Let's get over it.   ---  --- Ultimately, I think you should skip DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER.  The only reason to see it is if you are a completist about the series and desire to watch them in order.  It is an awkward insert into the series during the transition between Sean Connery and Roger Moore.  The Ultimate Edition does have crisp picture and sound.  If you must struggle through the film, make sure to get this edition because it is at least watchable.  But if you only desire to watch the better Bond films, skip it.  Diamonds may be forever, but this film died a long time ago.  
We just installed these this weekend on our upstairs banisters - they're great. They're strong enough to keep our 11-month-old baby from falling through -- we pushed and pulled on them after getting them all fastened. I still intend to watch him carefully when he's up there, but these will definitely protect him in an emergency. Just be sure to follow directions -- tie them tightly!! They're not that bad, looks-wise, either. I can still see my spindles through the netting so the "look" of the stairway is basically unchanged. Of course, looks are less important than safety! I think I'm going to get these for our outdoor deck, as well. I'd recommend them
Why did they even bother transferring this movie to DVD?  Seriously?  The [...] child of a masterpiece, "The Vanishing" sports some of the most half-hearted performances and sometimes downright hilarious performances of the 90's. ---  --- This isn't a matter of comparison.  This movie, all by itself, just sucks. If I hadn't seen the original I'd just think, "what a brilliant plot, too bad they decided to bury it (no pun intended) with everything else in the movie". Jeff Bridges manages an unintentional bust a gut type performance as the sociopathic professor; his accent is so forced and ridiculous that one wonders occasionally if this a parody of that great, gut wrenchingly disturbing, Hitchcockian 1988 movie.  Sandra Bullock and Kiefer Sutherland are themselves, which add nothing to the movie.  ---  --- And the ending.  Oh, the ending.  We've been cheated.  Totally cheated.  All the power that this clunker might have had is torn away in a fervor of "It has to be upbeat!" Hollywood cornball syndrome.  Sandra Bullock is RESCUED, the villain is hit with a shovel, and everything is A-OK!  Even though Kiefer Sutherland's original girlfriend has been buried alive and suffocated.  This is [...]of a great movie.       
This camera was great at first and very easy to use, however, the condensation error many others seem to have came true for us as well.  When we first got the error it had not been anywhere near any water or moisture, so we put it in our cedar chest (we keep our house very dry and don't live in a humid area - Nebraska).  This worked for a few months, but the error is now on permanently and the camera is useless.  I wish it was different, but bottom line, this is a disposable video camera - a nice one, but still disposable
Nuparu is SWEET! But, sadly, his skull does not glow in the dark. Nuparu has black/gray armor, a light up sword with a strobe effect, two claws, and a Zamor sphere launcher attached to his back. You must be careful with the zamor spheres, though, because they're easy to lose. Now I have Toa Matoro and Toa Nuparu! YOU HAVR TO BUY THIS TOY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This isn't a bad dryer when it comes to convenience and travelling. However, the folding handle did eventually break and I had to modify it to hold it together. I haven't noticed any benefit from the ion control, mine and my wife's hair get's easily frizzled with this dryer, plus it takes a long time to dry in comparison to what others have claimed. The switch is definitely very difficult to use, there's no way a person can use it with one hand.  If you tried, you'd end up dropping the thing. The fact that the off position is between the two speed settings isn't very good either because you push so hard to move the switch you simply move from high to low instead of to the off position. Personally, I can't wait to find her a better one so I can tear this one apart for more interesting things. On the upside, after fixing the handle, it has worked without any real problems for 6 months
I drink all types of teas, but this is one of the worst tasting teas, in my opinion
This is a wonderful GF cereal!  It is crunchy, a touch sweet, and the fruit is a wonderful addition.  This is the first GF cereal that my son will really eat. He frequently has 2 bowls, and he does not eat much!  Highly recommend
I've used MS Streets and Trips for years with minor problems.  This year I upgraded to a Windows Vista Laptop and wanted the latest software for it.  I have a GPS and I use a Pocket PC PDA so I need Pocket Streets. ---  --- After I got home I read the fine print on the box.  It list support for no higher than the Windows XP OS.  But, so far the program is running fine on my Vista machine. ---  --- The laptop has no serial COM ports and S&T 2007 won't detect a USB port. The description of S&T 2007 which includes a GPS indicates it uses a USB port but apparently it needs the included USB adaptor.  I could not locate where I could purchase such an adapter. ---  --- S&T 2007 no longer ships with Pocket Streets.  Nor could I locate where I could download a copy.  I can (for now) use my old Pocket Streets program because 2007 does EXPORT Pocket Street maps. ---  --- Finally, within two miles of my home the map list an airport and runway that was shut down in the early 90's.  The main highway a few blocks from me has only 3 exits in 2 miles yet S&T 2007 list over a dozen intersections which means when I get directions I always end up down a dead-end road. ---  --- I've purchase many versions of Streets and Trips and this is the first time I felt I've wasted my money. Open software can't be returned from where I purchased it.  I guess I'll have to start researching other software packages. --- 
Actually Garth Hudson, the former organist of the Band does not play on this cd (nor 'every geriatric rockstar's'). The musician you might be referring to is Al Garth ex of Loggins/Messina
I am very satisfied with Nizoral Anti-Dandruff Shampoo. Many anti-dandruff shampoos tend to make my hair feel dry or rough. I have thick, waist-length hair and Nizoral got rid of the dandruff and left it feeling soft and easy to manage. Unlike some anti-dandruff shampoos that have a medicinal smell, Nizoral has a pleasant fragrance. I'll definitely use this product any time I need a dandruff shampoo
I purchased this remote to replace a broken tv/dvd/vcr combo remote.  Before buying it I checked specs of several brands and types to see if they could be programmed for my combo.  This was the only one that definitely could. It has worked well...a couple features are not available but I expect that with any replacement control.  I've also programmed it to my bose radio and my dish network box and the controls have worked just fine.  Now my coffee table is a lot less cluttered
kodak door strains to shut with this battery. nice idea but, too bad for kodak owners. i have great success though with energizer lithium batteries. they last me a long time and fit perfectly
It was sent on time and it was the right stuff so i am happ
This is an excellent idea and greatly expands menu options while camping. You have to remember it is not a crock-pot though, the 6qt container is steel and not stoneware - I didn't. Therefore, a crock-pot dish that took 10hrs on low was done in 30min on low with this product, certainly this is not the product's fault but owner error. A very good product, highly recommended for campers and tailgaters
I have been a fan of ASICS shoes for many years my feet tend to overpronate, which puts a terrible strain on my knees and arches. Asics duomax technology allows me to run comfortably which I love to do but stopped for many years due to the strain on my joints,until I found these shoes. I absolutely love these shoes they have helped me regain the confidence and comfort to enjoy running again. This is the only type of shoe I will ever buy and has been the only one I have bought  for 7 years now ! I highly recommend this shoe! Especially if your feet tend to overpronate
I bought Paper Mario 2 for my neice to play when she comes over to visit, now she comes over to play the game.  It has an interesting story line and many characters to interact with.  The puzzles are only moderatly hard so she hasn't gotten stuck and lost interest, but the story is long enough that we haven't just breezed through it either.  It's better if you take so side trips to work the "missions" and fight in the arena (where you can build up your levels faster).  You can also revisit previous lands and re-fight the random encounters.   ---  --- The only drawback to the game play is the long cut screens that you have to read.  The game flow would be better if there was an option to read these to you, like Super Monkey Ball 2.  I know, I know, educational aspect of reading yourself, but that's her parents job, not mine :) ---  --- Game masters will find this way too easy but if you just want entertainment without getting stuck for long periods of time on puzzles then Parper Mario 2 will work for you. ---  --- Well worth the $20 pric
I don't think this product works - I installed 2 of them and my rooms are not that big. I saw a mouse even after that. I think I will have to engage professional pest control. If you are buying to control rodents don't bother to waste yr money
This was a baby shower gift and although the baby is still too little to use it, I can say that it is exactly as described and the parents were thrilled to receive it.
Very cute product and well worth the money.  My three year old loves all the things he can do with it in the bath tub
Great piece of equipment, no guessing how accurate the scale might be with this great Healthometer
Too many Christians are ignorant of our rich past.  We know a lot about the 1st Century and the current times, but everything in between is somewhat blank.  Christian History magazine is more than informative; it inspires, challenges and even admonishes in its unique way.  I look forward to each issue.  I doubt I will ever let this expire
I'm not sure how this magazine ever got the reputation for being more than the glossy fanzine it is. There's nothing wrong with celebrity mags, but this one has pretensions of so much more when essentially, it's about as deep as an E! True Hollywood Story about Kato Kaelin. I've tried many times, but alas, this one is sadly not worth the tree destroyed to print it
My baby is large for her age and wears 6-9 month sized clothes even though she is only 3 months old.  I ordered two of these hats sized 6-12 months.  They are way too big for my baby but will probably fit her when she is actually 6 months. Hats are made of t-shirt fabric and look just like the picture. You do have to tie your own knot on the top. Andrew Christian sent each hat in a separate envelope and they arrived on different days, but within the shipping time specified
I use it for the water pic function in addition to the sinus rinse tool I purchased.  Works great!
Don't waste your time on this thing until they fix the bugs. We bought the Bratz one & it thought it was a Pawz when we took it online. After 10 or so total hours (Yes, I know what I'm doing) fighting it I gave up & took it back. Tech support is a joke. There's NOTHING in the manual or online help, only a link to tech support who sends the exact same auto response every time, and none of those responses addresses the issue.
I ordered three pair of these earrings for Christmas gifts for the preteen set and am absolutely delighted.  Very nice quality and beautifully presented, boxed in a small velvet pouch. Absolute perfection
Back when Blondie was being hailed as the biggest new-wave band in pop music by fans and critics alike, there were also just as many critics that quickly dismissed Blondie as "bubblegum pop," and one group that would never have staying power. But I think it's been observed enough how the group has had the last laugh. Parallel Lines helped establish Blondie as a serious music group and turned their cult following into commercial success. This album is also the first where Debbie Harry's voice gets sharpened with the sensibility of a sweet, vulnerable girl one minute to sultry and rapturous behind disco grooves the next. The album made punk, pop, and disco shake hands, which was a method unheard of in 1978. Songs like "Hanging on the Telephone," "Picture This," "Pretty Baby," and "Sunday Girl," have become irresitable pop gems, while "I Know But I Don't Know," and "Fade Away & Radiate," featuring a terrific guitar lick by Robert Fripp, are punk-driven classics. Last but not least are the two hits that are forever getting played on the classic rock stations of today in "One Way or Another," and "Heart of Glass." And how has Debbie Harry played out as lead singer after all these years? As Rolling Stone stated when this album was ranked #140 on their list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, "Madonna was surely watching." 
My husband and I adore this monitor.  It picks up on every little noise our little one makes which is great.  We occasionally get some interference, but all I have to do is move the monitor and it goes away.  The interference never occurs on the unit in my baby's room, just on the parent unit so you do not have to worry about waking the little one up.  I love the rechargeable battery option and the ability to carry around the unit with me throughout our 2 story house.  I plug it in at night by my bed and it then runs all day long!  You can defintely trust this monitor
Even though I know it's important to eat breakfast, I seldom do it; I'd rather sleep a little longer. These breakfast bars are a nice easy way to solve the problem. I keep a box in the car and munch on them on the way to work in the morning...they're whole grain, nice and filling, and taste good to boot. They're also a nice treat on the way home. The Oats and Honey are my favorite, but the variety pack provides a nice change. All of the flavors are tasty: peanut butter, cinnamon, maple sugar - all yummy
Couldn't find this item in any stores in my town, so I went to Amazon (naturally) and found it!  The item was delivered on time, too!  Thanks, Amazon
Gun aims to be the Western version of GTA, but falls short.  Taking the non-linear, story-and-side-mission type action genre is a good idea, but the game just feels incomplete to me.  It is fun to play but on my medium/high end Pentium 4, 3 GHz, 1 MB RAM, GeForce 6800 GT system, the framerate slows down quite a bit.  Not just when entering new environments but at random times when I'm wondering why.  The game probably wasn't fully tested. ---  --- The voice acting is good but the graphics aren't spectacular even at the highest level.  Of course I had to crank down the graphics to increase the performance.  Gameplay isn't bad but GTA is much better as tasks are more difficult and require more time to accomplish.  The game took about 8-10 hours to beat the story missions and 15-20 hours for me to acquire 100% completion. ---  --- I also had an issue with not being able to assign some keys (like the semicolon key) to the game.  I hope there is a patch to correct annoying issues like this.  A funny part of the game is when talking to the people that give you tasks like the Indian hunter, marshal, and others.  They talk with their hands, and sometimes their hands move even when they're not saying anything.  It's downright hilarious in an untested sort of way. ---  --- The game is good and received an editor's choice award in PC Gamer.  I think it's overrated, but they did mention framerate-hits and lower-standard graphics as Gun's weaknesses.  I give this game a 78% due to the many performance/graphical issues I've experienced.  Activision online technical support hasn't proven its worth to me, at least not yet.  Hopefully a patch will come out
This is a poor excuse for a lens coming from Canon.  Can only be used at a certain zoom or you will get a circular ring around the photo.  Please do not waste your money like I did
I've read a lot of reviews on this product. It obviously works for some people, but be aware it doesn't work for everyone. Me being one of the latter. I've taken it twice and both times it did nothing. First time I took it before I left for work. The drive to work I was yawning and about to fall asleep. I didn't get 5 minutes of energy let alone 5 hours. Second time I took it was about 15 minutes ago. Still nothing. I was feeling sleepy and still am. My Mom, on the other hand, says it makes her energetic as hell. It might work for you. It might not, but 5 dollars (2 pack was all they had) is a lot to waste to find out.
This is fun. Not easy for 5 and under, but great for the rest of us. (7 - 65). Gave us alot of laughs
The product does just what it says it does.  It helped me realize my Mechanic was milking me for $800.00 when I could have fixed the problem myself for $107.00.  When I confronted my mechanic he said nothing because he knew he had been "had"
We stretched it across our pool but we have a stoper in the line so you fall in the pool. we just used some special clamps and a high compression spring. The kids love it because they can fly right into the pool
With the birth of our first child, there were tons of little toys lying around all the time, from teethers to rattles, stuffed lovies and blocks.  The traditional toy box was too bulky for our small living space, so when someone gave us this adorable tote we were thrilled to see how much fit inside, how sturdy it was, and how much our baby loved looking at it!   With bold primary colors and cute scenes surrounding the entire bin, there is even a fold out flap with a play space, and a singing bird which attaches to the side basket.  The fun roof is all made of satin ribbons that resemble "shingles."  This was easily stored in our closet or taken along on trips.   Best of all, there seems to be no end to how much you can stuff inside!  It is soft and collapsible, yet stands upright and will hold just about all your small baby toys.  It can be VERY GENTLY machine washed, but we discovered it was best not to throw it in with anything heavy.  I gave one to a neighbor when her son was born and she still raves about how perfect it was for their baby's toys.  I give this 5 stars without hesitation; affordable and totally functional
I've subscribed to Self on-and-off for about 15 years, but have recently been feeling like I've outgrown the magazine. The articles seem to focus on issues facing single women who are just starting their careers.  Fine, but not for me anymore!  Also, their subscription department is terrible!  My most recent subscription has been plagued with missed issues, double issues and late issues -- and a customer service department that can't quite pull themselves together. --- 
In an effort to boost their file numbers and appear to be more comprehensive, the creators included many VERY low resolution images that they "artsied" or "roughed" up with a dirty polaroid-transfer effect, or split up into 5 small stagger-stacked slides, which they must have hoped would excuse the poor quality of the original image.   ---  --- For example, if you do a search for "tiger", you will get 165 results, but only 86 will be of the animal, (and not one of 20 images of 10 toy tigers, or 5 images of one tiger-striped chair-cushion and so on), and of those 86, 80 have the crusty effect applied to them.  The other 6 tigers have been taken out of those same 80 images and clipped out of their background to give you a floating tiger on a clump of grass or a tiger head (but have, thankfully, not been "dirtied" up with the transfer effect).  Out of all, there is NOT ONE clean image of a tiger in its environment. ---  --- Here is another example.  A search for "sunset" yields 247 results.  Of these, 163 have the crusty polaroid transfer effect applied, and 70 are the same images duplicated (much smaller) in a sloppy stack of 5 slides. There are TWO clean sunset images. ---  --- These are typical results.  Numbers don't mean anything!  This product is stuffed with multiple images of toys, frankly not-so-attractive people from hard angles, and old low-resolution stock photos to achieve 150,000 files. Would it have killed them to include ONE clean, print-resolution image in each category? Perhaps we could have done without 50 of the fake slide images (talk about dated anyway!) in order to get a product worth having around
I bought this cd for one song, "Walk Away" which was one of their best known songs. I was hoping since that particular song was so good that maybe the album would harbor a few more gems. There wasn't. The rest of the album is like an anti-climax. I would suggest a greatest hits instead. If you see this cd just turn your pretty head and walk away
I know that no book can cover every topic, but this book left a lot out. It went into great detail about what I should do if I got some pretty rare diseases, but barely touched on the subject of Morning sickness, which is much more common.  --- And some of the information was just plain wrong. I trashed the book when it made me freak out in the 20th week because I couldn't feel the baby move. It advised that I should call the doctor. When I did, I found out most women don't feel it move until 21 weeks. Unfortunately I found this out after I had cried my eyes out thinking something was wrong. --- I would not suggest this book to anyone
I first bought the Mother's Clay Bar system a year ago.  It sat on the shelf until I tried it on my two year old Honda CR-V. --- It took less than 45 minutes to treat and wax my whole car and the vehicle now looks better than when I bought it.   You can actually hear those little rust causing impurities coming off the finish.  Stop destroying your clear coat or settling for less than a perfectly smooth finish get this product!  I do not own stock in,  or work for,  Mother's Car Care prducts
Worth more than the price tag. Beautiful and elegant. You will be very pleased
This protein is unbelievable. I have tried *many* different brands/varieties and this is without a doubt one of the best out there. It doesn't have the characteristic nausiating whey smell or taste, it's not too sweet, mixes lump-free in cold or piping hot water and packs a punch with 23g of easily digestable protein per scoop. Once you try it, this stuff will definitely become a staple in your pantry.
I purchased these earphone to use for swimming with a otterbox and an ipod shuffle.  They are were very uncomfortable from the start, but I could listen to music.  That didn't last long.  The connection would not hold and if I didn't hold it together, the music faded out. Also, music faded in and out from ear to ear. I finally gave up and bought earbud waterproof earphones that have worked quite well and cost less
I bought this for my grandson for Christmas, he was 8 months old. This has been the best learning toy for him, along with entertainment. He has learned how the shapes work and took this on soon. It has also helped him in walking. It is entertaining for me to watch him play with this toy, he has to push the button and play the music before he pushes it. I would actually buy one more for him to have at home with Mom and Dad. This is well worth the money
As my class of middle school students and I enjoyed the comments for Tuscan Whole Milk, one thought kept popping into our heads -- why not skim?  Why heap such praise upon whole milk and neglect skim, whose delightfully low-fat content has made my morning ecstatic for years?  I believe Tuscan Skim Milk will allow me to live forever (though I haven't proved that one yet).  My students say it enables them to do difficult homework with ease.  So, at last, we can breathe a full sigh of relief that Amazon is providing the world with the joy of skim
I have had several digital cameras and this tops them all!!!!  Everything they say about it, is true.  I love not even having to think about batteries, I didn't believe what people said about the battery life, and I was just happy I didn't need to think about batteries, but I just got married and my 13 year old daughter took more than 100 pictures with this camera and her pictures are almost as good as the photographer I hired and yes the camera battery lasted all day and thru the next 4 days on our honeymoon with another 200 pictures taken, no low battery light!!!!!  I even going to buy my parents one.  Also, one more note I love how fast you can take pictures, no wait 4 seconds between shots.  I had a Kodak digital before only 1 1/2 years old and hated it, I hated the download procedure, it didn't put your pictures onto your hard drive, but in it's own little cubbyhole and trying to attach them to your email was absolutely a nightmare, you'd have to identify the picture copy it to your desktop, remember what you called it and then attach it your email.  This is the main reason why I purchased this camera.  I will never own anything else, especially a Kodak.
I love this bottle dryer.  It was a little pricey but worth it! It holds a lot of stuff and is not in the way on the countertop.  I never put bottles, binkies, etc. away anymore.  I just leave them because it is so convienent
I guess I really shouldn't complain because my husband won the camera in an office rally. But the pictures it takes are disgraceful for a Samsung product every two to three pictures are blurred unrecognizably-where you can't even tell what you have taken. If you have found yourself among the fortunate few who actually found success with this camera thank your lucky stars. Even if it is a less expensive choice versus the other cameras on the market today spend the extra money it would be worth it not to miss any family moments like my family did,on this useless piece of CRAP
Well at least, some stuff is cool, free cam bag, the pics come out excellent. The video feature is really crappy and when you play back video its very choppy and the audio is a little hard to know whats being heard. Also you could through dozens of batteries with this cam. The adapter doesnt help only if youre going to sit down and review whats on it or keep the power from draining. The sd card kept popping out for someone which caused the cam to "freeze up". ---  --- Bottom line...I recommend at least researching other brands of mini-tapeless cams...but this one...isnt worth 159 or whatever. Its trash. Go for something else
Absolutely LOVE this product!!  Wish I had had one for my other 3 children.  We live in cold and windy North Dakota and this is just so easy to use.  There have been times my little one has gotten too hot when I over bundle him in it.  I recommend this to any one expecting a little one in the winter months.
**********UPDATE - THE OLD REVIEW (see below) WAS FOR DIXIEKIP.  THE ONLY REASON IT'S STILL TWO STARS IS BECAUSE I CAN'T FIGURE OUT HOW TO CHANGE IT. OLD VEGAS CHIPS HAS BEEN NOTHING BUT HELPFUL IN THIS MATTER EVEN THOUGH I DIDN'T ACTUALLY ORDER THE CARDS FROM THEM.  I WOULD ORDER FROM THEM ANY DAY OF THE WEEK NOW JUST BASED ON THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE IN AN ISSUE THAT WASN'T EVEN THEIRS.   MY APOLOGIES TO OLD VEGAS CHIPS IN THIS MATTER.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THEM AND IF ANYONE KNOWS HOW TO CHANGE THE STARS, PLEASE LET ME KNOW. IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN THESE CARDS, GO WITH OLD VEGAS CHIPS, NOT SOME OTHER DEALER!!!! - JIM ****************** ---  --- I ordered these particular plastic cards because in my opinion, they are much cooler than the paisley ones that are also offered.  I immediately ordered them, yet when my package arrived yesterday (in a timely manner, I will give them that) I opened to find the ugly paisley cards looking me in the face.  I have not yet contacted the seller to see what options I have, but this is going to leave me either two options, 1) return them and wait longer for them or 2)suck it up and get stuck with the ugly cards.  I will repost once I have spoken to them
I love Sophia Loren as an actress however this DVD as 3 movies in one package is a very very very poor quality DVD. Colors are bad, picture is bad and the sound is even worse. don't waste your money. My DVD copy was bought from Amazon.  --- this is my advic
Oh My. It enhanced my rolls instead of hide them. It did not help having the bones sticking out above my butt, which was very noticeable. Not worth the money charged for it.
Just received two of these. Yes, how dumb of me to buy two not knowing much about it.  The quality of the casing is really poor.  The plastic is very flimsy feeling.  The labels were all half-way peeled off upon opening the box. They show signs of just simply being really old. ---  --- The instructions are written in many languages which is fine, but there are things they fail to tell you.  I also ordered the Juice AA 4 pack and 2 of the batteries arrived dead. The charger blinks red with those batteries, but the instructions do not even bother telling you what a blinking red light means.   ---  --- If you go to the juicebattery website, they do not mention this product anywhere.  Not even when you search for it. A good chance this is a fly-by discontinued product.  The company themselves have not responded to by blinking light question for 3 days now.   ---  --- As with many things, made in CHINA! ---  --- I got a few more days yet before I need to return them via Amazon's return policy which as we all know, ROCKS! 
Our Oskar Multimedia Storage Cabinet arrived in a timely manner and was in very good condition. My husband assembled the unit with ease, until it was time to nail the card board backing on. Following the instructions he laid the unit down on it's face, of course the kick-board had already been added so it didn't lay flat. When nailing on the backing the "J" board (the center shelf holding the entire unit together) split at every point of contact. ---  --- We had ordered our Oskar Storage Cabinet through Amazon, directly from Ritz Camera. So, naturally I called Ritz to replace the "J" shelf. I was informed I would have to return the entire unit. I immediately pictured myself trying to get all those shelves back into the box and figured that was more trouble than I wanted to go through. ---  --- So, I tracked down the number for Oskar and called them directly. They were very efficient and helpful. Within minutes I had their assurance that they would ship a new "J" shelf to my home - at no additional charge. The shelf arrived within the promised ten-days. ---  --- This unit was exactly what we ordered and works well for it's intended purpose. I would caution you to be very careful nailing on the backboard, so as not to split the center shelf. My favorite feature of the Oskar Multimedia Wood Storage Cabinet is that they include plenty of extra shelves, unlike so many other brands. I have an entire stack of shelves that I can add as needed. I would love to have three or four more of these units. --- 
I'm so excited to use this table. The weather has been rainy ever since I got it. It assembled beautifully. Comes w/ it's own little tool. It's a nice strong, sturdy table but it's not overly heavy. I was able to move all the pieces to the patio and assemble w/o any help. It's going to get a lot of use this summer
This does not fold down 90 deg.  Don't buy if you think you'll be able to fold down and change sheets or something
I've been trying to buy this off the shelf and just could not find it (for, like, 2 years).  I mainly wanted it for texture -- table salt is not fine enough.  This stuff is so fine it completely changes the flavors.  I wouldn't have believed it myself
My husband and I went to Maui on our honeymoon 7 years ago. We actually brought some of this brand of coffee home with us. Imagine my delight to find it on Amazon! It is a very smooth coffee with an amazing aroma. Now I just need to go back to Maui
I just received my travel set today and I already love it! The bottle pod is more than big enough for the biggest bottle I have. The pacifier pod holds my daughters pacifier perfectly and the diapers and wipes pod is just too perfect for quick trips to the store or a friends house. I highly recommend it
Polarizing filters are used to eliminate glare on non-metallic surfaces like glass or water. They can also be used to increase the contrast and color saturation of your image. I use my polarizer not only to eliminate glare, but also to make skies a nice shade of blue or to get some "pop" out of clouds.  ---  --- There are so many options to consider when purchasing the Polarizing filter for your needs. For instance, linear vs. circular, film or digital versions, or quality vs. price.  ---  --- If you are making use of a TTL or auto-focusing system, Circular Polarizers are designed to work with those features. Linear Polarizers has their uses, but they are manufactured differently and may not work. Unless you are certain, just get a Circular Polarizing filter.  ---  --- There are some digital circular polarizers on the market. I am not sure what makes a cir-pl lens better for digital as opposed to film. I use a Canon 20D Digital SLR and see no problems caused by using a supposed non-digital filter on a digital camera.  ---  --- Most of the time, when it comes to filters; you get what you pay for. Does that mean you need an expensive polarizer? Of course not, just be sure to get the right filter for your needs. What ever polarizing filter you get, make sure it is color neutral to prevent unwanted tinting. Spending more on a color balanced filter will save time in post. If you need multiple filter sizes, consider saving money by using step down rings.  ---  --- Currently I use the Hoya Pro1 filters, as the Canon polarizing filters I previously owned were without question bulkier and heavier. The weight might not seem like much, but when you stick all your items in a backpack all the extra bits of weight add up quickly. I can spend a good amount of time with my equipment on my back so this is a big concern for me. When it came down to the images, at times I would see a browning tint on my photos. The tint is easy to clean up in Photoshop CS2, but I don't see that problem with the Hoya Pro1 filter.  ---  --- Overall, I would recommend against the Canon polarizing filters. I originally thought, "it is Canon, it must be quality." Since then I have replaced all my Canon filters. This filter works, but comes at a cost of disadvantages to other similarly priced filters.  ---  --- PROS:  --- Can be used for film or digital cameras  --- Eliminates internal reflections and ghosting  ---  --- CONS:  --- Bulky and heavy  --- Not neutral color balance
Jonathan Glover's book is not quite like anything you've read on war, state terror, and genocide.  The tour of twentieth-century horrors is thematic rather than chronological, organized according to the ethical issues Glover wants to explore.  This takes a little getting used to, but it allows the author to jump, for example, from the First World War to the Cuban Missile Crisis, to see which lessons had been learned in the interim and which might be applied in the future.  The cumulative power of Glover's pointillist technique is enormous.  "Humanity" combines a clear-eyed (necessarily often gruesome) depiction of *in*humanity with an informed and enlightening discussion of how leaders and ordinary people can change things for the better.  As an examination of the psychological and existential origins of mass murder and genocide, it marks an advance on Ervin Staub's classic "Roots of Evil," and should be of interest to any student of modern history and politics
I have the same review as the rest.  Thankfully, we checked it out after we bought it and were able to return it for another model before Christmas.  The remote control Lightning McQueen with the regular controls (one lever for forward and back, another lever for right and left) was an excellent alternative.  I would recommend it for any child over about 3 1/2. 
I bought 3 packages of Dr. Brown's (through AMAZON.COM) standard size nipples and I received 2 standard and 1 wide.  They shipped the wrong item to me.  I returned the wide to the address in Calabasas, California and have not received and feedback that they received it or any refund for the product as well as the postage to send the wrong item back to RIGHT START.  I enjoy using this product for my child because it is the only one that works for him.  Since my purchase, I still have not received anything except this email from AMAZON.COM.  I rate the product 5 stars but the service 1 star
It's soo cute and cuddly! Not only is extra soft, it's small enough to fit in your palm or make a great addition to a desk. It looks realistic too, it had the little cat fur covering its eyes making it even more adorable, the only downside if you trying cuddling with it to go to sleep make sure you take out the "TY" tag otherwise you would end up with heart shape marks on your face=
Used it once and put it in the dogs' tub. It's really awkward to use. It sucks up your water pressure, too. Can't figure it out. I have incredible water pressure, but with this thing on, it went down to nothing. Stick to the original shower massage by Waterpik
Spice 1's just different from every other rapper. And he's awesome. If you love hardcore rap, you'll love Spice 1
I used to give Omaha Steaks as gifts, thinking i'm giving a good gift. Recently, I ordered these for myself and was embarassed.   --- These steaks are yummy but are tiny, don't let the pictures fool you. They are small to begin with & after cooking are laughably tiny. Add the cost for the expensive shipping and handling, I could have done much better at my local butcher/supermarket. Save your money.
My Panasonic RV31K is five years old this month and after thousands of hours playing movies it works just as well today as when I first took it out of the box. Panasonic makes quality products and just like anything else mechanical you can get a lemon. If this player ever dies (cross my fingers) I will get another Panasonic. I choose mine after reading all of the reviews here and in epinions.co
I have oily & blemish prone skin and I was told by my Mother, who used to work for the Clinique/Estee Lauder family, to give their products a try because they are supposed to be non-cosmogenic. This product irritated my skin so much that I just had to rinse it off to relieve the itchiness. The only reason why I used it more than once was because it was supposed to leave behind a tingling sensation to show if it was working. If it was working, it hurt like hell and it made my face break out with more acne than I ever had all at once. Not worth your money
I like the idea, but the slippers just aren't comfortable to stand on.  It's great while you are sitting, though
Now, before you say anything, I have played this game and beaten it in the week provided by blockbuster(grudgingly playing it though)and now for the unbaiased opinion. I think that this game is so completely stupid. It and the sequel are retarded but again its my opinion.
this stuff smell delicious..who can resist? i love it !! smells like chocolate mint to me...love i
This seat took us from complete refusal to use a regular plastic potty to be almost completely trained.  For starters, kids like using the same seat as mom and dad..this seat allows them to do that comfortably. It is not too big and not too small, fits any toilet and travels like a dream. As the mom of a boy, I don't use the plastic guard because it sticks up too much over the seat, but even for boys this seat is mess free. And with boys, there is usually a little mess, but because it is plastic you can wipe it easily.  I love it, and my son loves it. I wish I hadn't bought the potty because my son refuses to use it..only this seat
I love the look and function of this watch BUT.....Guys if you have any hair on your wrists, be prepared to have it forcibly removed by the metal band.  I've had 3 other Fossil watches and never had this problem. I think Fossil needs to address the clearance between the links on this one. OUCH!
I received this after much debate about the prior review. Had seen this item described the same on other web sites and figured it had to be an error for the other customer. So I bought it and sure enough had the same problem. Amazon was great, they sent me a replacement and still the same problem. My baby is due any day so I am keeping the first one, but sending back the replacement. It doesnt come as described, no blanket included, and I dont see how you could adjust the wedge. I am very disappointed with the product, but happy about Amazon's willingness to assist in the issue.
Very pleased with the high capacity cartridge with my Epson Stylus CX6600.  "Compatibles" do not compare
So far, these fit the bill. Just used them for the first time--find that they are easy to put on, and comfortable--and better yet, don't interfere with jewelry as they would if they hung off a chain/rope/string
I love the Luke Fx lightsaber more than any other one because it is made nicely, it is light, and it has a good glow in the dark that makes it look real. I would not even dream of fighting with it, I would think it would break in a few days of fighting. There is not much to say except it is the best Fx next to the Darth Vader and it looks cool in the dark. It is so bright it lights up a whole room when the lights are off
This machine bubbles but they are anything but quiet. the water was cold in less than 2 minutes even though i put hot water in has per the instructions. A bucket would probally have done better along with air pump from my fish tank
Received this item and its great!! I have this under a gazebo and wanted an Asian modern look with straight lines. This was perfect. The type of wicker, (actually plastic) is VERY durable. The cushions are thick and actually solid. Some are real soft (cheap). These are not. This chair is really wide and sits low to the ground. I could not have asked for better. I bought the whole set and everything is great. Email me with any questions. chris.schaffner@gmail.com Orange County C
Misunderstood directions, made mistake of putting all sides together instead of a level at a time.Cracked all sides trying to take apart. Called 800 # and asked what they could do for me and they said Buy another one, they're not responsible. Also found out the box had two right side upper levels and it will take 7 days till the left side is sent. Suncast will never get my business again and I hope my warning will discourage others from doing business with this company
You know "Blush" magazine? Its fictional headquarters are the set of the NBC sitcom Just Shoot Me. You read their headlines and article ideas, and you know they're based on this little piece of waste! What shocks me is that I know 13-year-old girls get their dose of sex and guys information from it. Very shallow, they try to be so sophisticated it ends up being naive! Stay away from i
very clear,bright day, strong magnification quality seems to be good . very well priced at around $100.00.i will know more over the passage of time .my firstimpression is good mj schra
great item at a great price... I bought two for a bit more than one at local stores..
We needed some plastic coated bibs once we started solids and started with those super stiff plastic ones from Babies R Us.  The stiff bibs were great for keeping her clothes dry when she would keep her bib off of her high chair.  We've got a Svan high chair (the best!) that has a pretty small opening for the kid's torso, so a stiff bib that you are constantly stuffing in there is such a pain.  Also, when cleaning, if you got the back (fabric) side of the bib wet, the bib would be cold and wet for hours.  The bumkins bibs can be washed thorougly with soap and water in the sink and then hung up.  They will be totally dry by the next meal!  They are so soft that our daugher doesn't mind wearing them.  They do not get in the way and stay nicely tucked (assuming our daughter doesn't pull the bib up to look for "bib goodies" in the pocket).  We bought 2 sets and could easily use more.  They can also be washed in the washing machine (no dryer but they air dry super fast)
I didn't know that they made music videos this long. If I had known that's all that this was, I would never have watched it. THIS IS A HORRIBLE FILM! SAVE YOUR TIME AND MONEY AND AVOID THIS MONSTROSITY!
Hans Riegel was not only one of the most prominent manufacturer's of sweets, he introduced a product to the world that's far more addictive than crack or heroine.  These sweet little gummies are some of the tastiest bits of candy on the market.  Unfortunately they're addictive as well...my son foams at the mouth, begging for gummies at all hours.  At times this works to our advantage...bribery, a la the Scooby Snack. However, we know these are not the most nutritious snacks on the market. ---  --- Curse you Hans Riegel
I have had other APC battery backup's in the past, and the only negative comment about the product is the size and space required for the unit.  Given our power failures, brown out, and the high wind and storms in our area the APC does an excellent job.  I have not only my desktop PC, but my scanner, printer and digital camera on the system and it has saved my equipment numerous time for the power surges and failures
I no longer own my previous and much finer camcorder, so I finally found myself in the market for purchasing some kind of camcorder until I could get back on my feet to get another good one. I thought this one may do, good price, looks sharp, purchased on impulse . . .big NO-NO. ---  --- I will say the camera takes decent pictures (as the previous reviews state, almost exclusively outside in broad daylight or indoors with --- very good lighting). Other than that, don't bother. The MP3 is a cute --- function (and quite possibly the most practical). The video, UHH, let's --- not even go there. The voice recorder, also not bad - records in WAV format and can be transferred to PC.  ---  --- Jack of all trades, master of none . . .I guess that would be the best --- way to finally describe this item. I will say that I'll be saving up now --- for much better camcorder and no more "I just gotta have this right now" --- Save your $, find a quality product - even if you have to pay a little more for it. Trust me, it will be overall better in the long run . . 
I bought this make up at Neiman Marcus excited to try it and I was horribly disappointed. It was hard to apply (I accidentaly sprayed it in my hair and in the air) and what I did manage to get on my face, it did not cover much.  For the price they wanted this is unexcusable.  I promptly returned my Airflash and got my money back.  I do not recommend this product. 
Billy Elliot is an 11 year old who does poorly in the boxing ring but surprisingly well in ballet class (meeting with the boxers because of building shuffling needed during a coal miners strike). ---  --- This is the classic "family doesn't initially understand," "teacher believes in him," "screws up audition but spirit carries him through" type movie.  It's put together quite nicely, and you never really know how it is going to turn out. ---  --- The transition from ballet dancing to tap/jazz seemed to happen in one day, which seemed jarring. ---  --- The beginning of Swan Lake, with Billy as the lead and family and friends in attendance, 10 years or so later, was a real "feel good" part of the movie
Everything is this movie seems out of place. The old cliche "good cop-bad cop", lived by Sutherland and his pal doesn't work at all!  Dridget is in an awkward performance, totally unconvincing, unreal, flat.  ANyway, it serves to study how a movie with so good cast can be a  tremendous waste of time.
LOVE these!  These are a great treat at any age.  I bagged the giant cola bottles, giant crocs and gummy bears in a treat bag for my 4th grade students.  They were savoring the giant cola bottles.  I don't blame them.  I find myself chomping on them, too.  I don't even like coca cola
We are growing this in Arizona and having a fair amount of luck.  So far the plants are thriving well.  It helped to start them in peat pots.  The soil here is clay, so after they had their second leaves we transplanted them into the garden.  For our first time they haven't been much trouble yet.  Easy seeds to grow
For a guy who never paid attention to the face cream he used, I found H2O Plus to be amazing stuff.  Non-greasy, no heavy scents -- it's worth every penny
i'm writing this before reading the whole book but its a collection of articles so the different chapters are discrete units under a common theme of the economies of the arab world with a good deal on the economies of their oil producing GCC members. ---  --- reading this book more than twenty years after it was published is fascinating as so many of the issues and repercussions mentioned have either come true or held true and the state of the region has not improved considerably but even regressed in many cases. ---  --- consider the following excerpt from the book that i found interesting: ---  --- "the oil states today face tremendous challenges, as oil revenues start to decline. Few expected that the decline would come so soon. Everybody knew it would come, but it was expected later rather than sooner." ---  --- this is almost like seeing history repeat itself in real time. ---  --- worth a look if you're interested in the field
I found this book to be helpful as an overall general guide. It covers much of the general information needed to start and keep a saltwater tank. I was hoping to get more detailed information about different tank  environments (reef, fish-only, invertebrates), saltwater species, diseases,  etc. I would suggest for the true beginner
My hair was still frizzy after using this product. : 
Yes, I am a die-hard Star Wars fan and yes, I love a good mission-based action game so man, if this isn't the perfect game for me! It's so much fun and there's so much freedom in the game in itself! Add on to that the space missions and Wow, this game totally blows me away! Highly recommended for anyone who is a Star Wars fan, a FPS fan, or a fan of fun gameplay
I just got this watch as a Christmas present.  It is gorgeous.  The only thing is it's a little bigger than I would like it to be.  The face is so femanine, but the size makes it a little masculine.  The face is about an inch and a half in diameter, and the band is a little over a half inch wide. ---  --- Because it is SO pretty I am keeping it, however if you prefer a small dainty watch, maybe this one isn't for you.  My friends are telling me bigger watches are "in" now so maybe they're right??
There is no need for this item.  It is a huge inconvenience to have this big stiff box in the middle of your bed.  I hated having a wall between my baby and me.  When I woke up to nurse, I had to take her out of it anyway.  Co-sleeping is intuitive, naturally safe and easy easy easy... please don't spend your money on this unnecessary complication of a natural arrangement.
I purchased this item for use while driving my car in Oct of 2005 for $29.00 without tax.  I was told it would work for the LG phones which is what I have --- I see now you can no longer find these for sale and gee I wonder why... --- I probable used this item a total of 8 times when I drove my manual transmission car, I didnt really use it while driving my truck which was automatic.   --- The Jabra now does not work...and after only 8 uses, a friend of mine also bought one and his lasted about 6 months as well.  While using it the phone cuts out and the caller can not hear you at the other end and you have to constantly pull the plug and stick it back in, after a while you just give up cause it doesnt work. --- I emailed the company several times at info@jabra.com but have not tried to call them yet and had no results with the emails.  I have a feeling I lose anyways with this purchase. --- The thing is not worth the money and does not seem to last long and is not made for LG cell phones, Iknow the one I got with the phone stinks due to the fit but al least it was free and still works top notch. --- To bad this was a comfortable ear piece but very short lived. do not purchase this even for the 4.99 prices you may find it for on Ebay
Well, at least she does for my 3 and a half year old daughter.  Each episode is compact with a simple theme covering the whole educational gambet.  Beware, the theme song may start to make adults twitch after a while.  The DVD has a different narrator than the original (Neal Morrissey) videos, but all in all a good viewing for the under 5s
First off, top notch customer service- there's a personal touch that's rarely seen in on-line purchasing!  Please keep it up! ---  --- Now for the goods: These vanilla beans are a fantastic value.  Seriously, I wasn't expecting much- I was hopeful given the other reviews- but I've learned some hard lessons to not expect such high standards of quality- especially when it comes to gourmand items-  These beans are even superior to those I can get from my local provider (at three times the cost, mind you.)  I've even ordered online from two other sources (one recommended by Martha Stewart, lol)- and these beans are plumper and more supple than those other pricier providers.  (Plump and supple- always a good thing.) ---  --- If you're on the fence- I urge you to go for it.  You owe it to your recipes to use quality indredients.  You will not be disappointed.  I know I'm not. ---  --- Thank you kindly
THIS VEHICLE IS NOTHING BUT JUNK. IT DOES NOT MOVE WELL ON THE DRIVEWAY AND DOES NOT MOVE ON THE GRASS AT ALL. MY GRANDSON USES HIS FEET TO PUSH IT WHICH IS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED FROM A $100.00 TOY. --- VERY DISAPPOINTED. I WOULD LIKE TO SEND IT BACK FOR A FULL REFUND
For around $20. dollars you could save your life and the ones you love. ---    This is super easy to use....both the transmitter & reciever run on batteries so there's no installation. I put mine on my back porch so when --- I open the door to let my dogs out at night for a quick run nobody will --- be there to surprise me. People who keep dogs for protection are fooling themselves. But these units are perfect. I've had mine for several days --- and NOT once has it gone off for no reason....but it HAS sounded every time it should have. The range is even better then I expected. Only two things I'd change. Why the LED on the transmitter? I taped a dime over mine so it doesn't show. Why alert intruders they're being watched? And --- it would be nice if the reciever could be plugged into an AC outlet to save on batteries. I have ordered a second one because this little device really gives me peace of mind
It clearly states for the shell material 100% nylon. The price and the nylon shell was the main reason I bought the jacket. The jacket is completely polyester. The tag says Shell: 100% polyester and Lining: 100% polyester. Returning it would be pointless. I'm very disappointed in the accuracy of the information
This movie is a must have for all family libraries. It appeals to adults and youth alike. A true feel-good movie about how we are all the same inside, no matter what our outward differences are. Really teaches the lesson, "Don't judge a book by its cover".
If you played any of the pc/video games than you know how much they left out of this movie. Still, its one of the best "B" movies I've ever bought. I enjoy it every time I watch it
At 23 years of age, I can truly say that I have been a lifetime fan of Sesame Street. Watching the 3-DVD set of Sesame Street - Old School, Vol. 1 has been both nostalgic and enlightening. Because I was born practically a decade after most of the material on this set originally aired, I expected most of the content to be new to me (I was barely a year old when Mr. Hooper's death was explained to the world), but that was not the case. Many of the short films and interstitials were familiar (and not just because I used to watch Sesame Unpaved on Noggin) to me as a viewer from the mid-1980s, and I think that just underscores the quality the show has exhibited from the beginning. Sesame Street truly revolutionized children's programming, not just because it was educational, but because it was (and remains) entertaining, not pandering. I'll admit, seeing Gordon with an afro, Orange Oscar and the first few tries at Big Bird's head still freak me out a bit (as they did when I saw them on Noggin several years back), but the show itself is just as good as I ever remembered, something that cannot be said for most nostalgia entertainment (like Transformers or He-Man or JEM). ---  --- The set contains five full episodes from the first five seasons, and 54 (the liner notes are incorrect, they should have asked Count for help) bonus clips. The set also includes the 25 minute pitch-film that was made before the series originally aired, explaining Sesame Street's message and motive. Although the episodes have a disclaimer that it is not necessarily intended for today's pre-school children, I believe they would probably enjoy "classic" Street even more than the current lineup of shows. The fact that today's pre-schoolers may be more advanced than the Sesame Street of yore can really be attributed to Sesame Street itself, and that's pretty cool. Still, I personally appreciate that the aim of the set is at adults, because so many of us associate our childhood with Sesame Street. A booklet is included that gives a brief overview of the series from the first five years and I found it informative.  ---  --- According to Muppet Central, a few sketches were altered or removed for music copyright issues (one with Stevie Wonder, one with Rogers & Hammerstein), but because I never saw the originals, I found nothing amiss. What astounded me more than anything was that at the end of the first five years, more than 600 episodes of the show had been produced. No wonder they can't release full seasons! Although the full-length episodes are great, my favorite part are the additional sketches from each respective season. Seeing Kermit sing "Bein' Green" in its original form, the "Bread, Milk and Butter" cartoon and the "In in the Sky with Diamonds" parody is a real treat. ---  --- The picture quality is great -- especially considering the program's age (and the fact that it was one of the first programs to be recorded on video, although film was used for most of the interstitials) -- I doubt the show ever looked as good as it looks right now. The sound quality is good too -- mono of course -- but clear and crisp. ---  --- Overall, I highly recommend this set for anyone who loves or loved Sesame Street. For those who were born after these episodes aired (like me), looking back at the beginning is really special. It is clear that everyone involved had a true love for teaching and interacting with children and taking television to another level
Very light weight, appropriately sized, not too gaudy or flashy, accurate so far, reasonably priced - pretty much everything I was after in a watch
The music intelligentia probably won't like James Morrison's new album because almost everybody else will love it.  Bourgeois = uncool.  However, if you just listen and feel this album, even if you have snobbish tendencies, it will move you.  Enjoy this amazing new album.  I am
This is our third baby monitor.  The first two had static if you would plug anything into the same outlet or get them near other electronic devices.  This one has worked flawlessly in our home w/ zero static.  The talkback feature is also wonderful for a three year old ("Go back to sleep," "I'll get you juice in the morning," etc.)  Not having to get up and go to the child's room is a real feature. ---  --- The only reason I gave it four stars is because it only has two channels and because the signals aren't encrypted.  Anyone else with an FM receiver can pick up your conversations, but most monitors are this way.   We took the monitor to a friend's house and it picked up a lot of static/interference from something in the house (Video monitor, TV, I don't know.)  Since it only had two channels, we were not able to find a clear channel.  ---  --- Overall thoughts: Best monitor I've had (Stay away from the Fisherprice models).  I would buy again unless I was in an apartment complex (I wouldn't want other people listening in), and I would be prepared to take it back if I needed more channels
I bought this for my daughter when she was 2. I agree with the other reviewer about the weight of the product. It is so heavy that it can actually hurt a child if it turns over. I still let my daughter play with it but only when she's being supervised around it. And I have to make sure that the toy is not on any type of unstable ground. There are other good shape sorters out there - I wouldn't waste the money on this one because of the potential safety hazard.
Relevant Magazine has great articles for people who are in to culture and faith.  Many of the reviews are of secular artists, the spiritual content or message (or lack thereof) of the music they sing, films they make and books they write.  They also review Christian artists, many who are on the fringe.  This is a great magazine for those who are interested in these things.  If you just want a 'youth-oriented' Christian magazine with Bible studies and how-to's you'll probably be disapointed
All Thomas the Train products are overpriced. There are too many companies out there with a better selection of wood train sets for half the price. Choose one of those! Save yourself some money
These lounge chairs are hands down the best deal that I have found. They are extremely comfortable, sturdy and attractive! Plus free shipping and they come already assembled..which is a big deal for me since I am not very handy!! Great item and great deal all around
This book was written in the '80s was copy written in 1990. ---  --- It has a folksy tone and some technical information. ---  --- Unless you are buying your church's sound system at a second hand store, this book is going to leave you wondering what might be available today.  For example: "CD recorders are under development". --- 
My mother-in-law purchased the sandbox for my son, who was not quite two at the time.  He has played with it everday for the last four months straight.  I can't even hide it from him.  He loves filling the sandbox with other trucks that he has.  This toy keeps him occupied for hours.  He has so much fun with it that we are using others for his second birthday
The new Adobe Acrobat has a cleaner look and feel, and is more user-friendly.  I especially apreciate the new quick distiller buttons in any Microsoft application, which allow you to create a PDF in one click rather than having to go to File and Print. Some functionality as before, with some new organization and better look/feel
This thing doesnt slide well and the front cover falls off easily not worth the material it was made from if you don't ever open your phone this is the case cover for yo
the lego community workers set met our expectations and even more.  The set comes with lots of different pieces and has made our lego experience very fun. Albeit a little on the expensive side, this set is well worth it
Good basic book, bringing back points I had been taught, and a few new to me.  Price most reasonable. 
This shopping cart is the perfect height for my daughter.  My two boys even love to use it to cart around their cars and blocks!  Highly recommended
This game is a joke. It is the same exact game as the 2005 version with minimal additions. The online play is so glitchy and drops so often its not even worth the time. Do not go out and buy this game thinking that its better because of all the hype. If you want to play a great football game go get NFL 2K5 by 2KSports/Sega Sports. This game is 3 years old and blows Madden away any day of the week. In 2k5 you are able to go to roster manager and change your rosters to make them current. You can edit players and create rookies like Reggie Bush or Jerious Norwood and make the roster the same as the current 2007 NFL lineups. Madden bought the rights to be the only official Nfl game for the sole reason that Madden sucks and he wants to make all the money and not spend any money improving his game. Madden bought the rights to the Nfl trademak through 2010 so no other companies could make an official Nfl game and thats why there is no 2k7 or any other game football game for it to compete with. Thats why Blitz is the only other game and they cannot use Nfl players so they have to have a generic game without real players. I hate Madden with a passion. 2K Sports is the way to go for any sports game including football you just have to do some manual labor updating rosters but once you have it is current and still 10x better than Madden will ever be. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Im not from USA. My brother bought me the camara in a trip three months ago and it is not working!! It has serious conection problems in the body that I cant fix in my country. I lost 1000 US
Why buy Iolo System Mechanic when you can get malware for free? --- I installed Pro 7 and it gave many, many problems. Iolo did not respond to my emails so I uninstalled. Their uninstaller did not work either
I found these at Lane Bryant and I absolutely love them! I wear them under my work clothes every day. You've got to try them
These "steaks" are only distantly related to real Prime Rib.  They are tasteless (other than being overly salted), have a texture reminiscent of congealed soy protein, and look even worse.  Omaha Steaks are at the bottom of the barrel when it comes to mail order meats, do yourself a favor and look elsewhere
Whatver your favorite fruit may be, this game will certinaly not be in your cadre of favorite games. It is basically boring, and ill-conceived. I have played it  a few times with my kids, and found it to be of no particular interest on any level-it is neither fun, exciting or challenging, for them or me. I strongly recommend you try a Cranium game , or how about CHESS??? The only positve thing i can think of with regard to this widly overrated game, is that it's better than TV, which isn't saying much
I bought this book, the paperback version. The text is good, it describes all his letters and tries to do a lot of explanations too. However the prints of his paintings are not that impressive.  They are very dark prints. Go for some other book if you want to see the corect colors of his paintings
Don't waste your time even just simply flipping through this magazine at the newstand.  Trust me... there will be no worthwhile patterns (I mean... just look at what they choose to grace their cover!!!)  ---  --- I have stopped hoping for even a half-way decent pattern to come along during the two years or so.  I have seen litteraly only ONE knittable pattern in the last three years (December 2004 I believe it was... a lace cardigan with beaded trim).  Even the articles are pointless.  Save your time and money and get a subscription to Interweave Knits or Vogue Knitting.  Or opt for a new magazine (not available at all newstands in the US) called Simply Knitting, which is imported from the UK. ---  --- It amazes me that this magazine is even still in production with how horible it is!!
After hearing Oprah's rave reviews of this perfume, and seeing that it was one of her Favorite Things for 2005, I thought for sure I'd love it.  I ran right out to the nearest department store for a sample of it!  I just had to see for myself... ---  --- Well, I was NOT impressed.  The scent is so strong and overwhelming that it actually seemed to "catch" in my throat.  I accidentally got some on my hand and after four hand washings I could still smell it.  I guess, for those of you who like this perfume, that's probably a good thing. ---  --- Anyway, I think this perfume is too "old lady" for my taste.  It reminded me of J. Lo's Glow.  Which I also have and don't like. ---  --- For comparisons sake, perfumes I do like are Britney Spears' Curious, Clinique Happy, Escada Island Kiss and Lucky You
Easy to set up and worked great for 2 months then it just stopped working.  Horrible customer service!  Will never buy from this company again!
This is a great iron for a starter, but will not do it like a stylist. I have had it for at least 2 years so it will last also. The price is a little bit to high I only paid $ 19.99 for it at Walmart.I know everyone has gotten used to shopping online because it is eay and always open, but I have to tell you that most of the things I have found on amazon are priced way to high. They used to be a great spot to get good stuff cheap but that is no longer true. I think it just kind of creeped up on us without us noticing what was going on. Please folks go back out in to the world and start looking you will see that I am not wrong
Nothing but self-important producer yacking about how accomplished he was at an early age, as mere snipnets of what I thought was going to be a movie were shown. Very disappointing, as listing didn't indicate that this was not the full movie uninterupped
Hi, I just wanted to let everyone out their know: that this stuff works.  ---  --- I have had problematic hormonal acne since the age of 21. I'm 27 now.  ---  --- After I graduated from the university and started working a real job, the stress went straight to my face (you all know what I am talking about). Unfortunately for me, I am allergic to benzyl peroxide and I have extremely sensitive skin. I also do not do well with tea tree oils and most sulfur and acidic products (basically anything that can kill acne - leaves my face itchy- either swollen like a tomato or is ineffective and I have painful acne bumps...which would you rather do?). ---  --- I was a little hesitant after reading the ingredients and noticed that the cleanser had sulfur in it and there was also a jar of pure salicylic acid for blemishes. But, after using other philosophy products for my hair and body - I decided to give it a try. Hell, what's another 50 bucks if it can clear my acne - and if not I can always send it back. ---  --- I started using it about 3 weeks ago and my skin has had a tremendous transformation. I finally feel like my acne is under control. I recommend this product fully and it is my duty to tell everyone this after suffering with relentless acne for so many years.  ---  --- The cleanser is awesome and needs to be in a larger size. The blemish serum is extremely drying, so if you are sensitive like me read the directions and take it slow - don't reapply throughout the day, until your skin is ready. The day and night face creams are cool. The day one is kind of like glue and seals in the treatment - the entire day! That's why it works, because it is on your face until night time when you wash (I can even faintly smell the product). Then you use your night hydrogen peroxide cream, yes not benzyl. Yeah, this cream is intense as well. So take it slow until your skin is ready.  ---  --- One thing that I do recommend is that if you wear make-up, use the purity cleanser (not in the kit) to initially clean your skin and then use the acne cleanser. That's what I do and it works for me - so I will share it with you. ---  --- Another thing I do is I will take a little bit of the hope is not enough SPF moisturizer and put on very little on my super dry areas. Remember this acne kit is intense and you may be prone to drying out and peeling - so some oil-free moisturizer can help hydrate the area around the acne. ---  --- Well that's about it. I hope this helps you and let's you know that your acne can be tamed and doesn't have to run your life.  ---  --- Take care, --- M. Rodriguez --- Surprise, AZ ---  ---  
These are THE BEST truffles I have ever, ever tasted! They come in milk chocolate, dark chocolate and white confection - the chocolate lovers dream!!!  There are 18 pieces per package - control yourself though, the serving size is only 7 pieces!! The creamy filling is heavenly!!  My absolute favorite is the White Confection...my mouth waters just thinking about it!!! --- If you love chocolate - you need to find a package of these - you'll be in paradise with every bite! ---  --- 1smileycat :-
Love this game. With family and/or friends it's one of the best card games around. It is easy and doesn't require a lot of attention (you can watch movies, talk, hang out, etc.) yet keeps your interest. It's also a game people of many ages can play because it's not too difficult. A good card game for having friends over to play over dinner or while watching a ballgame.
one of the most important features that should be told is how far down the ground a metal detector can detect both coin size and large items. i'm annoyed with this and many other metal detector's descriptions which refuses to mention this more than important point. i'm shopping for my boyfriend and just because of all the annoyance i may just give up and get him a $10 tie for his birthday.
Bread8, that's one of the stupidest comments I've ever read.  You don't know s*** about metal.  You can't handle the intensity of real metal because you're a fat virgin who'd cry to your mommy if you heard godly metal songs like "Immortal Rites" and "Pleasure to Kill."  Leave the metal to the metalheads you mallcore f@ggot. ---  --- Anyway, "Dysfunction is better than Staind's other stuff, but only by a microscopic margin.  Aaron Lewis is a weak, talentless crybaby whose bandmates couldn't make a good song to save their lives.  Every song on here is full of bogus "pain" and "depression" coupled with abyssmal musicianship just like every other nu-metal band. ---  --- If you want heavy music that's accessible for the masses, go for Rage Against the Machine (except for "Evil Empire"), Faith No More, Helmet, Living Colour, and Quicksand.
Just rented this dvd and was quite surprised.  Normally, I'm a big George Clooney and Matt Damon fan.  However, in this film, their talents were underutilized and did not make up for the poor script, editing, and direction which made this film quite dull to watch. ---  --- While the idea behind the movie is good, it could have been more entertaing, dramatic, or suspensful.  As another reviewer remarked, I was quite tempted to shut it off after 45 minutes and watch something else.  But, I did suffer through to the end, where the film just sort of ends and leaves viewers hanging..
This era of Tangerine Dream (TD) was just great. The Virgin Years were truly a great period for TD. For me it deals with space and landscape. It's so close to repetitive music that would come much later. It's also the one group that used rythm to structure these flying melodies. You could fly with them and end up with more in the end. You can't say that for too many of these Electronic groups. After that period they would go on with this ambient music that wasn't up to the same standards. It seems they are back (with other musicians of course) with the same kind of concept. Great! They were an important link on the electronic scene. A great album! A great period
My original charger broke that caome wit the cell phone. I was going to go buy a charger but they cost like $30 if you get the name brand. This one I purchased does the trick and saved me lots of money
The metronome was everything I expected.  I wanted a metronome that was very loud so that it could be heard while playing in an ensemble and also one that had a volume control.  The sound is loud enough to be heard while playing ensemble and has good volume control.  It is not digital so one can easily switch tempos. It is light enough to be easily carried around.  What I would have liked, but did not expect is a tempo range that goes beyond 40 - 208.  Unfortunately, that seeems to be found only in digital.  
I'm sixty years old and I have been using this product for years. When I had my yearly physical the Doc ask me if I used anything because my skin looks so good. RoC delivers!!!
This coffee has a rich, bold flavor, dark color, and nice aroma.  Very enjoyable drinking!  Comparable with Starbucks bold coffees. --- 
These jeans were so very disappointing.  After hearing about PDC many times, I was excited to own a pair.  But these jeans were made of cheap, uncomfortable fabric and the style just doesn't work.  I won't be buying PDC again
I purchased this product to put 2 CDs together.  I had never attempted something like this and was a total novice.  Audio Cleaning Lab was terrific!  I found it easy to understand and use, with unexpected options that improved the project I was working on. My one word to describe it--- simple....or maybe...effective...or maybe...straightforward...or maybe...uncomplicated...or maybe...useful...or maybe...valuable...or maybe..
Poorly designed. I slide my 2400 into it and the case is so tight it pressess buttons on my iPaq for me. Turning it on in the case. Cheaply constructed. You can buy better for less. Check out the cases [...
I have used only two bottles of this sauce over a period of years. I enjoy hot sauce on my food but this one can only be used on large quantities. I use it mostly with chili. One small drop,not dash,in a big bowl will have tears flowing from your eyes! If you like it hot! This is the sauce for you
Fuji fails to honor warrantee - Don't buy from them ---  --- Do NOT buy the Fuji digital camera. They charged me $[...] for a fix within the warrantee period. Their support manager told my wife the cameras are not being built well and dust gets inside destroying the gears. Rather than fixing them they replace them and then they charged me for the replacement even though it still had months left on the warrantee. ---  --- [...
Love this tub. The hammock attachment works well for small infants
My son runs true to size on most clothing including Childrens Place but the PJs run very small and when I held them up to each other the different patterns were sized different.  At 5 months he is still wearing 3-6 mo in most PJs but already grown our of Childrens Place 6-9 mo PJs.  I bought several pairs and some of them he never could wear.  Buy a different brand unless you can go to the store and actually try them on
it sucks it breaks easy and doesn't work good   dont waste your money like i di
This truly excellent collection of Singer's stories (all originally composed in the Yiddish language) are as colorful as the people about whom the stories were written. Here are tales of weddings, of jokesters, of happy occasions of all variety, of feuding farmwives, and of unrepentant fools. After reading through a handful of Singer's works, a person gets the feeling of how it must have been to live as a Jew in eastern Europe a hundred years ago. This was a culture rich in its traditions and lore, a people who loved life and kept their identity through good times and bad. Singer, himself born and raised in the region so many of his short stories describe, was one of very few authors I would unhesitantly dub "a human treasure"
I read the reviews and alot of people said they run 1 to 2 sizes to big. So I always wear a eight and I ordered a 9. They were huge on me. I sold them to a friend. also the ankle part was really wide for my foot when it was in the boot. I'll stick to my Ugg's
I'm not sure why so many of these (all?) reviews are for a different product, but this one is actually for the balancing bike. We got this for our son for Christmas and he loves it. He just turned 5 and has a bike with training wheels but it's still too big for him. I don't really like the idea of training wheels anyway so I started looking for something like this balancing bike. I saw a German one for $350 so I was thrilled to find this one for under $100. ---  --- It was so easy to assemble. I love that the seat height adjusts. My son rides it around the house and after just a few tries was able to coast down the hall on it with his feet off the floor. I think it's a much better way to learn to ride a bike. ---  --- The quality is good, the seat has a bit of padding, and I expect it will hold up well for my other child when she's old enough to ride it in a couple more years. ---  --- I gave it four stars instead of five because it's put together with screws, it's not fine craftsmanship. Best buy in its category though
These sweatpants are extremely comfortable, reasonably priced and come in a variety of colors...Definetly a great buy..
Fellows: ---  --- I picked up the DVD in London, at a cost of 20 pounds, or about US$39.  There were still four copies left at the Virgin Superstore in Picadilly Circus.  So you got be able to find it somewhere, even not on Amazon.
Comparing Oceans 11 of the 1960s to the remakes of today is like comparing the Vegas casinos of yesteryear and today.  The hippest casinos of that era were, by today's highest standards of casino elegance and class (no, I'm not talking about Excalibur), dull, smokey, hokey, and cramped - just like the original Oceans 11. ---  --- I'm as fascinated with the Rat Pack as much as anyone, but I think it's important to take the rose colored glasses off when critiquing the work of these sometimes neurotically insecure and deeply flawed individuals in order to judge a movie on its own merits.  I think too many peoples' sense of self identity is reflected in the image of the Rat Pack to ever really do objectivity justice. ---  --- Humor and style do evolve (my father, for example, finds no humor in some of the most critically acclaimed shows on TV today), so it's hard to compare two different eras.  Nevertheless, great, timeless cinema came out of this era, but this work is not in that category.  By any movie standards it drags heavily and its "hipness" seems contrived and forced into an otherwise hokey vibe. The musical interludes and final stride down the Strip are incredible for reinforcing this image (and I do love them as stand alone moments), but jar so completely with the tone and style of the rest of the movie that I can't help but think this was just a vanity flick to satiate the appetites of fans hungry to devour media images of the highest style and pizzaz that era had to offer. ---  --- Regarding the issue of whether this movie appeals only to an older generation, it should be noted that those in the younger generation who have reviewed this movie favorably are teenagers.  There may be something deeper at work here - an adolscent (or arrested adolesecent) quest for a two-dimensional, this-is-what-cool is mantra by fans of any age. ---  --- To me this movie is little more than a vain time capsule revealing how much tighter, interesting, and more sophisticated not only most movies but perhaps society at large has become.  That said, there's still an audience for the old school casino in which dank slot machines greet you at the door on the way to the cheap buffets, just as there is and always will be an audience that smugly holds this 1960s Ocean 11 as superior.  I know I'll take a hit in terms of "was this review helpful" points from this crowd, but by the nature of who they are they got away with a lot that would never compel an objective viewer free from the folklore enmeshed in this intriguing group's fame. --- 
In my months of 'experimentation' and a few purchases in err, this is the best product of its sort out there. ---  --- It's the ONLY product I've purchased (or tried out in the store) that truly requires only ONE hand!  With my 8 month old on my shoulder, I drop this bag into the cart seat, I unzip it flip the 'diaper pocket' over the back, pull the generous, elastic edged cover up and over the cart handle and that's just about it. ---  --- Additionally, the Buggy Bag is among the few that covers the whole cart, and (uniquely) adds further protection from germs with 2 separate belts: one to go around your child's waist, the other to secure it to the cart. ---  --- Not to be forgotten: the Buggy Bag comfortable (apparently!), has simple convenient storage options and stores itself w/ ease! ---  --- On the other hand, I tried one imitation in a popular Baby store and not only did it not open with one hand (a necessity with a baby on your hip in a grocery store parking lot!) but I could NOT get it back into its 'carrying' shape with two hands!!  I hid it on the shelf and moved away quickly.  eek.  Another product I purchased online came in two pieces and had so many clips and belts wrapping it together, that I could barely attach it with both hands and help from passersby. While it had 'shoulder straps unlike any other, they dont work in most carts that put an advertising placard on the back of the cart seat.  Finally adjusted, that product (the "Shop'n'Dine") didnt cover most of the cart. (on its debut shopping trip) I threw it back in the car and went home, too tired to shop. ---  --- Finally, there are lots of imitators out there, dont be suckered in by similar names, better price points or preferred fabric choices:  the Buggy Bag will preserve your sanity and, perhaps, your child's health.
The Jellifish is the first radically new thing I've seen for guitar since the Ebow. I love innovative musical tools, and the Jellifish delivers. I am a guitar instructor and teach over 50 students a week from beginner to very advanced. I have had all of my students purchase the Jellifish because in order to get the Chorus! Pluck! and Bow! sounds you must master 3 picking styles that every guitarist should know how to use regardless. Specifically, a fluid, sweep picking technique will produce a lush chorusing effect that is a cross somewhere between a 12-string and a chorus pedal. Alternate picking, when done properly from the wrist, will produce the Pluck! effect, which somewhat sounds like a hammered dulcimer. And circular picking -- done from the thumb and forefinger -- will obtain a bowed effect that is very nice on slower, scalar patterns, but can also be used on arpeggios. 100 years from now, the Jellifish won't be novel, because every guitarist will use this the same as they do capos and slides. Minimal proficiency with this device is de rigueur for any serious student of the instrument
If you want to picture yourself wrestling with poles, and pins while camping, then this is the item for you. The instructions are made only to confuse things more. It could be made so much more user friendly. --- Once it's up, it gets a thumbs up.
A friend of mine gave me this cd about a year ago, I listened to a few minutes of it and was like "What is this crap?" and I shelved it for a couple months. I then picked it back up and gave it another listen. To my surprise it was really catchy to me. The music (and lyrics) are simple, but thats what I like about them. Theyre simple! This is a great college-rock cd. I plan on checking out more Teenage Fanclub, and I suggest you do the same. Notable tracks are Sidewinder, What You Do To Me, and Is This Music?
We all have very pale skin in my family, and these are great little "I forgot to put on sunscreen" helpers!  I keep one in the car, one in my purse, etc., so we are never without one.  Excellent product, and easy to use
hi all  --- I am very happy with the unit and the service from amazon in sending it to me . --- It has the features I wanted it to have,  and is very easy to use
These shoes are so light that sometimes I forget I have them on. They are so  comfortable than I don't want to take them off. I have to walk a lot every day and I am not kidding when I said that any other pair of shoes make my feet sore after a few hours of use, but these shoes do the job to perfection.  --- I highly recommend them
Generally harmless, except for one very offensive song about siblings that hate each other and hate their parents.  The song is probably funny to ultra-sophisticated, cynical adults.  But the song is totally inappropriate for a four year old.  I wouldn't bring this CD into your house
Mirrors are too small and too distorted.  The picture on the package shows a perfect reflection - as if!!   ---  --- It's about as useful as taping two foil-wrapped sticks of chewing gum to your handlebars and expecting to be able to see reflections in them
This movie tugs at your heart strings in a completely honest way. The movie does not patronise or make pathetic the boy hero who has to endure. It is the very opposite of saccharine glop. ---  --- It is a profoundly optimistic and yet realistic movie. The movie is peppered with memorable eccentric and kind characters. ---  --- 
Birkenstocks are a great thing for my diabetic feet.  I found this particular model to be a bit narrow to my liking
The bought 3 polar fleece caps and they are all one size fits all, but either I have a big head or something becuase it doesn't cover my ears all the way. As for my husband that actually has a small head it fits him fine. So I guess if you have a big head don't get it becuase it will not cover your ears.
I BOUGHT THIS ITEM A FEW WEEKS BEFORE HURRICANE WILMA HIT SOUTH FLORIDA... I KEPT IT CHARGED FOR 2 WEEKS WITHOUT USING IT AT ALL...AFTER THE STORM HIT AND I TRIED TO USE IT THAT NIGHT... THE SPOTLIGHT STAYED ON FOR ONLY 20 MINS TOPS BEFORE IT TOTALLY RAN OUT OF POWER LUCKILY THE CAR CHARGER WAS IN THE BOX AND THE LANTERN LIGHT WORKED VERY WELL ON A FULL CHARGE...BUT I DO NOT GIVE PRAISE TO THIS ITEM AT ALL AND I GAVE IT THE CREDIT IT DESERVED THE 1 STAR IS FOR THE LANTERN AND NOT THE SPOTLIGHT...CRAPPY AT BEST...PLEASE DO NOT BU
This is the story of two Tazo teas. I found that they almost need one another to produce a tea of exceptional quality.  ---  --- I tried each tea separately and finally blended them together. Tazo Lotus and Tazo Wild Sweet Orange make a wonderful lemony hot tea in the winter or enjoy being tossed about with ice cubes in the summer.  ---  --- The way I make this tea is by steeping two Lotus and two Wild Sweet Orange filterbags with 16 ounces of water. I make this in my coffee maker so there is plenty of time for the flavors to seep out into the steaming water. Then, you can add 2 tablespoons of orange blossom honey for hot tea and a bit more for ice tea.  ---  --- Drinking this blend is an aromatic experience. Lotus Decaffeinated Green tea is a blend of naturally decaffeinated green tea, natural lotus flower flavor and other natural flavors. Wild Sweet Orange is a blend of lemongrass, blackberry leaves, citric acid, rose hips, spearmint leaves, natural flavors, orange peel, safflowers, hibiscus flowers, rose petals, natural orange essence, ginger root and licorice root.  ---  --- I love the crinkly sound of the paper bags protecting the precious contents. The boxes are also quite intriguing and the stories on the tea packets are always mysterious and playful.  ---  --- A romantic tea with a golden-orange color. I can never decide if I like this best hot or cold, so I end up drinking it hot and cold. Half on ice and half in a mug. When this tea is hot, it is much more romantic and aromatic. When chilled it takes on a more bitter component.  ---  --- For something even more exotic, try the Tazo Green Ginger tea. That was the first Tazo tea I tasted and so far I can't think of a Tazo tea I don't love.  ---  --- ~The Rebecca Review --- 
Bought this Mp3 player for my girlfriend for christmas. She loves it. It is small and easy to use. The headphones could be better though. The process of puting songs onto the player is simple and fast. Considering you cannot hear the music without headphones...and the headphones that come with it are not very good, it only gets a 4 out of 5
This cd has so much going on and going for it - it's one of the number one releases this year for jazz fans.  Lee Ritenour is one of those guitarists who sculpted much of the west coast evolutions in jazz during the 80's and you can hear why people followed his flavor on these tracks.  He's never sounded better and the musicians who contributed with him on this cd are tight and magnificent in their own right.  ---  --- "Blue in Green" is one of my favorite jazz compositions by Miles Davis and Ernie Watts on tenor sax more than does it justice.  "Ocean Ave." is as breezy and beachy as I think it's meant to be.   ---  --- My favorite tracks are easily "She Walks this Earth" (Ivan Lins' vocals are bossa nova beautiful), "Blue in Green" and predictably for me "Papa was a Rolling Stone" with powerful, crystal clear, unique trumpet by Chris Botti and soulful, rhythmic vocals by Kenya Hathaway and Grady Harrell. I went looking for that track because I am transfixed by Chris Botti's trumpet and what I found was a remarkable cd in its entirety.  Happy me.  ;
The watch arrived in timely fashion and was already set up.  This watch is super.  However, it lacks a timer.  I left the Timex Ironman for this watch.  Timex's quality is horrid (a watch per year) and I changed to the Casion G-Shock based on a recommendation of a friend.  I am glad I did.  If they ever get a timer in this watch I'd buy another
I have friends who might be into this stuff, if only because they like the old and the strange. Me, I'm just like -- Is this "It's a Wonderful Life"? ---  --- I think I might have enjoyed this more if it was a novel or maybe if I picked up the script. As it is, this just barely seems to translate into a movie, and--forgive me for I have my own opinion--"City of Angels" was a good movie. Too bad if you don't like all this "contemporary nonsense." I feel like it worked. ---  --- My opinion: it's long, it's boring, it's hard to hear. Even if it has a message, I just can't relate to it. So maybe that's my problem. ---  --- Your opinion: your own. keep it. you're lucky I gave it two stars
I had high hopes for this stuff. I have watched Blow Out and know that he knows his stuff when it comes to hair, but I cant seem to get this stuff to actually do anything for my curls and waves. I have tried it on wet hair, damp hair, dry hair-no discernable difference. I will stick to my Frederic Fekkai products-they actually work
I have not yet used an FZ30 or FZ50, but I think this thing beats the pants off an FZ5 or FZ10 as far as image quality is concerned. Really nice camera. Has a nice dSLR type feel. 71% of people that check out the FZ20 here actually end up buying the FZ7, (as of today) but I do not believe the IQ of the FZ7 could hold a candle to that of the FZ20. Buyers may be on the *more megapixel* bandwagon. You can do a lot with 5 megapixels.  ---  --- I have found that the IQ of the FZ20 is very close to that of a dSLR
thes item is gretes item i used befoer for these prise!! yes is true is very clear optics , you can see in total darknes about 350 m it's agood rand , price and  qulity .
Alas, we have the entire Locomotion set but the cute little mobile won't fit our sleigh-style crib.  I called Babies R Us to see about some sort of conversion kit, but there's no such thing.  I'll be returning it this weekend and getting some crib toys instead.  :-
The description says "slipcover zips off for easy cleaning", but the product did not come with a slipcover.  The pillow itself is in the blue gingham pattern.  Now I have to find a slipcover that won't blend in with the blue gingham pattern underneath
I am a regular U.S. reader of other Future Publishing art titles, and was overjoyed to see the first title on the newsstand of this fantastic magazine. ---  --- ImagineFX explores the digital science fiction, fantasy and anime genres through letters, interviews, portfolio expositions and fantastic tutorials. All issues also include pull-out artwork by the featured artist, as well as a companion DVD featuring files for the tutorials, artwork and software. Within the magazines pages one will find a wide assortment of styles and artists, including everything from tutorials by noted conceptual artist Ryan Church to explorations of gothic art by several fantastic artists which all serve to expand your creativity and help you along your own creative path. ---  --- On the minus side, most of us U.S. readers will be put off by the per-issue pricetag. But for those living in the U.K. (lucky!) or those U.S. readers willing and able to part with the money, this magazine is not to be missed
This is 100% organic, unrefined coconut oil.  Yes, it tastes like coconut, but it is supose to.  A food should taste like what it is!  ---  --- The nutritional value of this food is outstanding.  It contains a lot of lauric acid which is also found in mothers milk and is both antifungal and antimicrobial.  It is stable at room temperature and does not become rancid quickly like other popular cooking oils.  It requires very high heat to release free radicals (I do prefer red palm oil for high heat cooking options because it does not release free radicals at all).   ---  --- My Suggested Uses:  smoothies, slow cooked baked goods, sauteed foods, mixed with maple syrup over popcorn, homemade cosmetics, and as an occasional conditioner for dry ends of long hair. 
The software was installed flawlessly.  Programs have worked successfully and been exactly what i need and wanted
I used this camera once and have no good photos to show for it.  It took 5 frames then skipped several and took 2 more, then nothing for the rest of the roll.  We swam with sharks and I have nothing to show for it. Should have bought a disposable one
This is a great stroller and an awesome price on Amazon.  I wish I had it 2 years ago.  It folds nicely and isn't very heavy to lift in my van.  I use it for walking and the swivel wheel is great
What else could you expect from the belgian's... buy hey, jean-claude, at the premiere of cyborg you let me and my cousin in the rain.  You were stuck in brussels... so, i'll still owe you a signed poster ;) ---  --- This movie is what it's all about, off course, bruce lee was widely known.  But this one is trully magnificent... the story is based on a true-story, the movements are very very athletic and beautifull... to make it short... ---  --- THIS MOVIE HAS IT ALL !!! ---  --- More from this please instead of such stupid movies were chinese men make 7 flips in once while throwing some stars on top off a bus for example... ---  --- This movie let's you see what it really is... ART !!
This is one of the best products I have seen for the car seat.  I am very particular about my car and did not want the leather to get messed up.  This product is the best and will prevent items from spilling onto the sea
If you're looking for a high-quality telephoto zoom lens that is fast enough to use indoors, you may have found what you're looking for.  The 70-200/2.8 lens produces beautiful results that are overall on par with the 135/2 prime lens (although not quite as sharp). ---  --- The main downside to this lens is that it's big and heavy.  I don't mind carrying it around my neck on the camera so much, but when you go to use if you have to put extra effort into keeping the lens from shaking in your hands due to the weight.  And it's not exactly the sort of lens that I would want to toss into my backpack, just due to the immense size. ---  --- If you don't mind spending an extra $500, consider also the 70-200/2.8 IS (image stabilization) version of this lens.  It weighs even more, but the built in IS unit should help compensate for shaky hands whilst using the lens
It performs adequately for my use. I am trying to laminate single sheet instructions for my wood working tools and guides, so the instructions do not fade or get lost.
This is a dream!  Quick-brew _and_ blueberry!  It's slightly slower brewing than plain Lipton quick-brew tea, but it does brew up in about three minutes.  It's definitely blueberry flavored, and it's a little red in color.  For we impatient flavored tea lovers, this is a great product
These Pretzels are great!!  I needed an alternative to wheat and found these spelt pretzels.  I had them prior to ordering them on Amazon so I knew to expect they'd be awesome.  Several family and friends have tasted them and can't tell any difference to pretzels made with wheat.  However, I like these spelt pretzels better than your average wheat pretzel! --- I don't like too much salt and I found these pretzels average on the salt factor.  Like every other bag of pretzels, the salt does comes off and settles at the bottom of the bag which is always fine with me.   --- The only thing I don't like is that in the ingredients list they say made with Organic Spelt and also Spelt.  While they meet the standard to label their product organic, they should use ALL Organic Spelt
I originally bought the Blue (5 lb), Red (7 lb) and the Black (9 lb) Gripmasters for my 14 year old boys. The Blue is a little too easy for gripping but excellent for exercising the ring and little finger. The Blue was too easy for them so they did not use it so I ended inherited it. It is pretty habit forming and fun to use because the tension is light, this makes it good for use anytime, anywhere. (I have used it stuck in traffic and it is also a good stress reliever) If I had to do it again, I would have probably not bought this tension unless you have a very light grip, probably have started with the Red. Just remember that this is mainly for fingers and hand exercise so very easy to use for gripping, the challenge is working out the fingers. It is not like using the regular heavy hand grippers. It has increased my hand strength and grip just by having it with me and using it during the course of the day without planned workouts. Great product, excellent for finger or hand exercise, good quality
I can't even begin to say how much I love these albums (i just picked UYI 1 to write my review for both).  Everyone always says that Appetite is Guns best album...no way in hell.  The Illusion albums are so much richer.   ---  --- Now don't get me wrong, I love appetite but it is more of a party album with cool guitar work and catchy tunes.  The illusion twins are just so much deeper lyrically and have many more styles woven in and out of a hard rock framework.   ---  --- I can identify with so many of axls lyrics, and the music just makes them stand out so much more.  Slash is basically the best hard rock guitar player ever, and he has more awesome solos and leads on these albums than most guitar players have in a career.   ---  --- And the best part about these albums is that the lesser known songs are usually the best, such as: Locomotive, Bad Apples, Dont Damn Me, The Garden, Pretty Tied Up, Coma, Civil War, Get in the Ring, Breakdown, Estranged (kind of popular but still fairly unknown) 14 Years, Bad Obscession, Dust n Bones, Dead Horse, and more.  Then of course there are the hits, Dont Cry, November Rain, Knockin on Heavens Door, Live and Let Die, You Could Be Mine etc.   ---  --- The only songs i dont really like that much are My World (wtf?) and shotgun blues, but everything else is just so gdamn good.  Do yourself a favor and go buy these albums if u consider yourself a hard rock fan.  The illusion albums are art, plain and simple
I just love the color, the stile  and the price. --- It is a perfect player. ---  ---      Thank you.
I've only just started.  But so far, I am very pleased with this language program.  My only regret is that I don't have enough time to keep at it.  The various learning modalities are quite useful-this is the only program (aside from taking a class) that i've used which does this.  I recommend it
This magazine reads like an inflight magazine: something airlines, careful to not stir any scary adreneline rushes, put out to lull their readers to sleep. Not controversy here. No thought-provocation. Don't you wish someone out there would publish a really good magazine about books? One that featured meaty stories and well-written reviews? Well, alas, this one ain't it. It is dull and bland. Occasionally it offers up a conservative book review by neocon writer Catherine Seipp, who is about as enlightening as Bill O'Reilly (that is, entertaining and offensive and laughably stupid) so this can sometimes cut the dull. But someone here said bland and I agree. Avoid this one if you have an IQ above 90. Pick up The New Yorker, The Atlantic Monthly or Harper's if you like to read intelligent writing. Or, if you like romance novels, mysteries and other badly written pieces of fluff--which is all this magazine covers--this might just be the thing for you. I want my money back
Indispensable for many areas of Theological research - Church history, Dogmatic overviews, biographies, editions, and so many many other things. --- A masterpiece! If I could afford it, I would give everybody who press the "yes" button by "was this review helpful to you?" a copy! :-
The radio for the boom box worked.  The CD player did not work.  I had to return it to be repaired or replaced. I do not have it back yet
The Moondoggies are very comfy and cute as can be! Perfect for wearing to the park with the kids but nice enough to veture out in the evening... I am buying another pair.
If you got here looking for a bag for an XACTI camera, keep looking. This bag is too small. It can be used for holding memoery cards and batteries, but not much more.
WARNING!  This video has no captioning.  I've rented it and it does NOT have captioning.  It is useless to me and fellow Deaf and Hard of Hearing folk
I bought this locket and got it engraved with my sons name on it(Caden) It looked great. You could fit 5 or 6 letters on it. It was a good locket
Wow! I love this spykids movie way better than the first one. I think of the first one as an introduction for the characters and the sequel is the big adventure for all the Cortezes and even more characters, like the Giggleses. We met Donnagon in the first movie, and he was the reason for the Cortez parents to go on the mission. Now we see that he has kids and we relize that he has bigger plans for the OSS. And what about Alexandra, the preisidants daughter? She is the main reason we know about the transmooker device, right? Also grandma and grandpa Cortez are joining us in this movie. I think Robert Rodregiuz did an execallent job on the sequel, Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams. ... The sequel is awesome!!!!
This is a great game for two players (and two players only).  The first one or two times I played, it was very, very slowgoing because there is a lot to take in.  However, once you adapt to the numerous cards and they become familiar to you, games tend to take about an hour.  It's a fairly involved game, so you have to be in the mood for that.  There's a lot of strategy and many ways to win.  I greatly recommend it for those who already enjoy playing games.  It might be daunting for a really casual gamer, though.  If you like it, there are now expansion sets available that add lots of spice and variety to the original
My brother, Henry, always said this was his favorite movie. He loved film noir...(although I didn't know what that was at the time) and, of course, he loved Richard Widmark in his role. Looking back, Widmark should have gotten the Academy Award for Best Suppporting Actor for this (he was nominated) but there are many Oscar "should'ves". If you like prison/gangster movies, classic film noir, Richard Widmark, Victor Mature and, of course, Brian Dunleavy, you've gotta see/own this...if you havn't/don't already
I needed a basic watch for time and running and this fits both well
I recived a Blackberry for my birthday in the box the blackberry came in there was a plastic case I tryed to put it on but it wouldnt fit but eventuly it did I tryed to press the enter key but it was covered by the plastic. The reason I gave it a two star was at least it holds it very tight but it makes it impossable to answer a call. I suggest you get a leather on they work alot better
I got this Heart rate monitor and the strap was way too small so I had to order a replacement strap when I went to change the strap the battery was dead the battery lasted only 1 week.  so I had to buy 2 new batteries one for the watch and one for the chest strap and now there is a line of pixels out on the screen of the watch.  I am going to get a forerunner those seem allot better.  I was very disappointed with this my Suunto dive computer is great this HRM sucks.  
I was a bit skeptical about buying this product because of the other products I have tried that claimed to be spot-free and failed   miserably.  I was pleasantly surprised with the Mr. Clean AutoDry system!  If you follow the directions and put a bit of effort into your wash job it works very, very good! ---  --- - You first rinse off your vehicle with regular, unfiltered water either through the AutoDry gun or with your regular hose sprayer. ---  --- - Next, you use the AutoDry on the "soap" setting and completely cover the vehicle.  They advise to only use the Mr. Clean soap, of course, because it contains agents not normally found in other car washing soap that assists in the sheeting action (similar to Jet Dry for the dishwasher) ---  --- - Thirdly, you give the vehicle an old fashioned hand wash with a sponge.  Make sure you do a good job and clean it completely or you will find streaks when it dries with the old dirty water smeared all over. ---  --- - Fourth, rinse the vehicle completely with unfiltered water.  Make sure you are very through in this stage.  Take your time! ---  --- - Finally, set the AutoDry to the filtered rinse setting and go over the vehicle again.  Make sure you start at the vehicle's highest point to remove all the tap water sitting on the roof.  Basically, you want the filtered water to remove all the unfiltered water.  Spray the filtered water in all the crevices to avoid spots later (side view mirrors, bumpers, etc.) ---  --- Although it sounds like it takes a long time it is really quite quick if you put some effort into it.  I can do a complete vehicle (Ford Explorer) start to finish in about 15 minutes.  The car dries completely spot free EVERY time!  Of course, the results will only be as good as YOU make them.  If you don't wash completely or rinse the unfiltered water off completely there WILL be spots.  It is up to you to do a through job to get great results
This really is a great tent.  Three people can sleep in it, but I've found it best for 2 people because then there's still room for all of your stuff (or a dog. lol).  I've used it for 3 years, and it never disappoints.  I've been in one good thunderstorm in it, and it did great and didn't leak at all.  It's very easy to set up, (especially when you arrive at your site after dark).  It vents really well, but best if you face the vented side into the wind.  Just don't forget to open out the little cross vent (with the "!") on the other side.  The inside pockets are really handy, and I think you can get a "net" that you can hang from above for more storage
If this is to truly be GYBE's last piece of work, then they've concluded their brief and dynamic catalog on a fitting note. ---  --- While I still believe "Lift Yr. Skinny Fists..." is their masterwork, "Yanqui" is easily a close second.  Where "Fists" had a broader range of sounds and textures - elements of sacred and profane - "Yanqui" is more balanced and focused.  Although you could argue this point, I think "Yanqui" never gets as high or low as "Fists." ---  --- The sound on "Yanqui" is entirely consistent with their previous releases.  As other reviewers mentioned, the only major change is the absence of field recordings, which actually helps to distinguish this album as the finale.  The lack of human voice adds a new aura of mystery to the work. ---  --- Well, there is actually another surprising moment on this album: it happens during a movement about halfway into the album.  The guitars drop off, leaving only a small ensemble playing dissonant woodwinds over a steady tribal percussion.  For a few minutes it definitely doesn't sound like typical GYBE.  In fact, the dissonant horns sound almost like a Ligeti composition (although Ligeti probably wouldn't have used a steady rhythm of any kind).  Fear not.  Not only does it work, but it swells nicely into a full band tidal wave. ---  --- But here's the most important point I want to make about Yanqui:  To me, it resolves some of the musical themes "Fists" introduced, which makes U.X.O. a fitting conclusion.  The last bit on "MFer=Redeemer P.1" slows way down, featuring one guitar with one violin (i think) playing together in fragile harmony, along with some distortion in the background.  When I listen to this, I can't help but think of the very beginning of "Fists," except the melody changes just enough to resolve the paranoia that  the "Fists" melody introduced.  In other words, it's like I can hear GYBE - at last - acknowledging that there does exist some...hope!...some goodness!....some peace!...in this world - the very place that's inspired them to make such dissonant music.  And, well, if GYBE can slow down and acknowledge something hopeful exists, well then, hope must exist.  Indeed, mother****er does = redeemer. ---  --- Of course, they give us one last act on "Yanqui" just to kick our butts one final time.  Yes, it gets so out of control that, at one point, the siren that's blaring in the background seems appropriate. ---  --- The very end, I love, as it builds and builds and builds with distortion and droning until the music finally-- ---  --- it suddenly ends. ---  ---  --- "Yanqui U.X.O." is possibly the final act in a brief but brilliant catalog.  It's an awesome finale
This is just like Cup Noodles without the noodles.  Eek
This dog looked so cute and fun in the commercials and it was the one of only two things my 4 year old really asked Santa for. Come Christmas morning, today, I open it and put the batteries in and all it did was whine and we were petting the head and chest hard. After about 3 minutes I did get it to bark then another 3 minutes later I got the tail to wag but the leg wouldn't shake for another 3 minutes. 20 minutes of trying to get it to do any thing at all it finally licked but the tongue was not wet and I did put water in it so it should have been wet. Then my daughter got mad because she couldn't get it to lick again. The dog doesn't even stand up like it appears to be doing on the box.. it just lays there. If you are buying this, be prepared to be paying for a highly priced stuffed animal because that is all it amounts to. I can't believe a manufacturer would put some thing like this out there so that kids can be disappointed on Christmas morning... this product should have just plainly been recalled
Since the Phileas came out a number of years ago, I've had 4 of them (3 fountain and 1 roller ball). These fountain pens have never let me down and have always been sound in quality. The first was the original red and blue series, the others were later blue and green marble models. They look nice and write very well. Many fountain pen users regard the Phileas series as the best place to start with fountain pens, and I agree with that. They're easy to clean, easy to use, and mine have always been ready to write for me. I whole heartedly suggest this pen as a fine addition to any pen collection, as well as for a nice fountain pen to use on a daily basis
Forza Eros!  May you live to make much more great music! Whether you  understand Italian or not, I heartily recommend this CD. In Ogni Senso  lives up to its billing- it delights each and every one of the human  senses, in ALL "sense" of the expression. This is a must-have for  any true music lover
not the pumps described even though i tried everything else.  I found that taking whey protein isolate at 200grams per day worked better at giving me a pump during my workouts. --- 
Antec has dropped the ball on this one.  My power supply came in DOA. --- If you read reviews there are lots of reports of short life on power supply.   ---  --- The case weighs 25 pounds.  It is a major hastle to uninstall everything and mail it back to California.   ---  --- It is a pretty case with some well thought out features, but not worth reliability hastles
Why people purchase a toy for tikes when it is specifically targeted at older kids is beyond me. Always look at the box for the minimum age a toy is best for. That said, all LTTO taggers, including this one, have a simple "grab and go" game called LTAG. All you have to do is pull the trigger twice and you're on your way. This is early in the manual, way before all the complicated games that frustrate 6 year olds and their parents. ---  --- I love LTTO. I even run a club that uses it here in Auburn, WA. But I *always* start new players out with LTAG, then move up to hosted games, and then to the more complicated games. Never try to start out by hosting a team Hide and Seek game, 'cus it's just too much for a young or completely new player. But that's why the LTAG game exists! Just grab it and play! No messing with the control panel. ---  --- Don't take a low rating based on an inapproprate purchase as worth much. Similarly, take my rating with a grain of salt since I'm a huge fan. But for kids 8 and up to adults, LTTO taggers are a wonderful, durable, and long lived toy that gets you moving AND thinking
I purchased 2 of them, put in new alkaline batteries, and found that it will not cut hair as advertised.  The motor is underpowered.  Useless product.
The amount of violence in this book is excessive over relatively insignificant motives.  I had a hard time believing all this was happening in 1948.  I am not questioning Mosley's portrayal of racism.  However, I did a little research into just how violent place Los Angeles was in 1948, and the answer is not very.  There may have been poverty, racism, alcholism, but L.A. county seemed pretty safe; the late 1940s had some of the lowest homicide rates since as far back as one researcher was able to find, 1827!  Mosley may have been more familiar with L.A. of the 1970s and 1980s and just assumed that it had always been that way.  Throw in speakeasies, gangsters hijacking liquor trucks, and one gets the impression that Mosley is confusing the 1948 with 1928. ---  --- I am not so pedantic as to insist that fiction be historically accurate.  But many, many people hail Mosley for depicting a dark side of life/era/place that had not been shown before.  From what I can tell, he has simply combined stereotypes from the 1920s and 1970s (I guess those years average to be about 1948).  Mosley is depicting a fantasy world of his own creation.  However, I doubt he ever tried to pass it off as authentic, and I hope readers realize that it is not. ---  --- Easy Rawlins in this novel falls into the rather weak, but unfortunately large, group of fictional detectives that actually accomplish little detecting.  A detective actually solves a mystery using his own intellect; that is interesting to read.  Detectives in less skilled hands solve mysteries via  confession.  Easy does solve one of the murders on his own, but just about everything he "solves" is simply confessed to him.  I find that extremely dissatisfying. ---  --- Mosley has packed the book with violence, but seems to know very little about violence himself.  None of the fights are well described.  Easy, for being a self-professed "killing machine" can't actually fight worth a damn and is surrounded by guns but does not apparently know anything about them.  They are either big or they are small.  He does not come of as being hard-boiled, but rather a pathetic braggart ---  --- Mosley does show signs of being a very good writer.  But I think he is too far over his head in this genre to come up with something exceptional.  I imagine that his work must have improved, but this effort is nothing to get exceited over.  And again, I don't obsess over accuracy, but a little bit of research would have gone a long way in firming the foundation of this novel.
You might think from the title and the commercials this movie is about a super sexy porn star slut...but it's actually the opposite. I really liked how the movie was done to portray the struggles some girls really have to go through in their carrers and mixed it with the toughness of high school. --- This is definately a movie i would reccomend to people over like 16 but only if you want to watch a funny movie about the discovering and strength of two people...This movie is the real thing, i enjoyed it and i think many other people could too
as the director and actors of this mess should, on their skinny french knees.  Complete waste of film and your time. Not erotic, sexy (? was that actress really a woman?, was her boyfriend really a man? or visa/versa) Damned if I could tell.  And that old man who tired her up, ya think he had enough rope? The movie was as clinicial as the gyno exam she went through.  French people are not pretty, and this woman was not only NOT pretty, but she drifted through the entire movie in a coma.  Even when she got screwed she looked like she was in a fog.  Save you money and your eyeballs and buy some french fries and eat them on your porch for the same experience
Works fine.  Like several other office packages lacks database program, Access
The version (2.0) has been altered to 'remove' the ability to 'hot coffee' mod the program. --- This version (2.0), while still containing the violence, language, and sexual references was altered to remove the ability to de-clothe' the characters within the game. --- The original release could be altered. --- The version (2.0) was released due to a small public outcry about the nudity. AND a few 'activities' that are going on while in the 'nude'..... --- Strange when you can remember the reasons why they tried to ban Grand Theft Auto 3 all those years ago. --- This time around they don't even mention violence. --- They are mad now because kids can see people 'nekkid'. --- ;-
My husband is a culinary student, so I ordered this magazine subscription.  He looks forward to each issue, and is always finding ideas when he reads F&W.  I know we'll subscribe for many years to come.  This is a fun magazine for those who enjoy cooking, both at home or in a professional setting
The item arrived to us the week of Christmas three weeks after we had ordered it.  It arrived with several broken and several missing parts.  Amazon would not send us new parts, they would only replace the unit if we shipped it back first.  This was to be a Christmas gift to my son, so that was not optional.  Had the order arrived when the order tracking said it would I would have had time to return it
This product does what it claims it will do.  Put in the time and effort - you'll feel great! Of course, I don't ever expect to look like the model on the box.  However, I feel good and I think I look a little better than when I started.  Only doing it a few weeks, but enjoying it
  I didn't want to invest a lot of money in an exercise bike as I plan to use it while recovering from surgery.  This one seemed to be pretty well rated and the price was very reasonable.  It does the job, but only just.  I've had it for about 2 months and the monitoring device has stopped working reliably.  Sometimes it tracks speed/distance/calories/time and sometimes it just won't come on.  At first it worked great.  Also, the seat is not very stable and is a bit wobbly.  Not in danger of falling off or anything, but just not a secure connection to the base.  Overall, the bike works about as well as you would expect one for this price to work, but I did hope for better quality
I've been looking for something like this for a long time.  This product has plenty of room in it for the tree that I have.  Unfortunately, it has no structure to it so it's very flimsy and makes transporting the tree somewhat difficult.  The fact that you've made something that replaces the original product packaging is very helpful though.  I'll give you an A+ for the concept and a B for the product design
I got mine for free on sale at least 6 months ago and it's great.  I know I should probably replace the head by now, but it still seems to work fine, so I don't.  I've only changed the battery once.  If you want a cheap brush that gets the job done easier than the old fashioned type, this is it.  Then again, if you're not lazy or weak, you can probably do just as good a job with a regular toothbrush and not waste batteries
Good product, like the price.  This is much less expensive than the current pinseeker 1500 models, I bought it on ebay used for $150 so you may be able to find it for less (look under hunting AND golf rangefinders for this model).  This does not have the pinseeker feature of the newer models but normal mode and scan mode work perfectly for ranging flags that have no reflectors (although you may need to try more than one time and have relatively stable hands).  I was able to range a flag at 270 yards, and was able to range the top of a telephone pole at 375 yards (but it was windy so the flag was straight out and a little cloudy).  I would estimate that this will work for ranging flags on a calm sunny day (these don't work as well on a sunny day because the laser used is a visible light laser and gets a little interference from sunlight) at 215-230 yards for a flag (which is what I need it for).  Less expensive alternative than the pinseeker, and I really like the performance, very impressed.
paying 25% for shipping and handeling was a bit much. 
These are hands down, the most awesome pillows, we have ever owned.  They were originally suggested by a chiropractor at $60 per pillow, however at the time, a "water bed pillow" for $60 just sounded silly.  What brought me back around to these pillows, was the year-long search that my wife and I had been on for the perfect pillows.  One of her beloved cats managed to destroy our previous and quite comfortable pillows, which subsequently caused us to get caught up in the frustrating search for the perfect pillow.  We spent a year, buying this pillow and that pillow, all to no avail.  Then one day I rolled the dice, and bought a pair of these pillows with the covers.  The covers actually make the dish.  These are the most comfortable pillows that I have ever slept on in my 42 years on this planet!!!  These pillows rate 10 stars!!!  Just follow the directions and enjoy the best nights sleep you have ever had.  I do not work for, nor own this company, although after using their product I wish I did!!!  Our pillows are about three months old so far, and holding up exceptionally well.  They recommend you change the water every six months or so, depending on what type of water you put in.  The pillow is about half to three quarters cushion, with the water being the bottom layer.  They seal tight and do not leak. There is no audible sound from the water in the pillow, as if you follow the directions, they will instruct you on how to expel excess air.  These pillows and of those Black & Decker scissors, have to be my two best finds for 2006!!
A lot of the online reviews say that this game is only half good, but it is my favorite game to play on the Wii.  Doing tricks and stunts with a truck is just a lot of fun.  And you get bonus points for ramming your opponents.   ---  --- If it were only like that on real roads..
I LUV FALL OUT BOY!!!!!!!!! ---  --- AWL SONGS GET 10 OUTTA 10!!!!!! ---  --- DESERVS ALL 6 STARSS!!!
I have always wanted to like greent tea but never been able to.  My sister gave me a cup of this tea at her house and i was completely won over.  It's taste is so smooth with the mild sweetness of jasmine.  My husband and i have successfully quit coffee thanks to this tea
Great swivel action, tough construction, easy to remove for adding air to your speed bag.  Worth the price
Shaving cream in a tube is just about impossible to buy at retail outlets. This is a great product and I will continue to buy it through Amazon
This was a great buy from Amazons sale rack at five dollars and 29 cents plus free shipping.  My [...] just loves puzzles and we are certainly fond of Melissa and Doug products.  We normally purchase them from Tuesday Morning or our local hobby store because they are usually cheaper. ---  --- This puzzle has made my toddler happy.  He fits it together then dumps it, repeating the process several times a day.  The drawing is realistic and there are no pegs, so it gives a little more grown up feel to the piece.  
My son is 4 1/2 and he loved the set.  He and his dad set it up on Christmas and enjoyed ringing the bell.  I would recommend this for kids any age
I'm here to find replacement parts for this toy.  My daughter was working really hard to try to make something work on this, and right when she got it together, one of the wires attached to the light broke off, when she tried to put it into the coil to make the connection.  ---  --- We can't solder it back in, there are no replacement parts and my daughter is crying at the kitchen table and we don't want to order another one, just to make her happy.  ---  --- Seriously, this toy is a piece of crap.   ---  --- I gave the toy high marks for educational value, because it teaches kids an important lesson.  Once corporations have your money, they don't care about whether or not you actually were able to use it, or have fun, or will need replacement parts, they only want to get MORE money off you, somehow.   ---  --- Also, buyer beware is an important lesson. 
I use a table top grill about 65 days a year.  The only one I can depend on is the Weber.  The only reason I replace it is when mine get stolen
I have to wonder what world, what physical plane, what state of mind were the reviewers here who gave this a good review on? Or maybe they are Full Moon employees LOL...First of all, the movie, especially one of the earlier scenes, was identical to the 80's flick "The Unnamable", which is also and HP Lovecraft based flick. The castle freak itself looked like a bad halloween rubber suit. When he breaks out his cell, well this was just hilarious, it reminded me of the incredible hulk. Yes, Jeffrey Combs is in it. But his acting is cheesy as it can be. Hunt down The Unnamable instead, a much better movie
Bought this CD based upon the reviews and the fact that they were recommended with some other albums I like, and man, what a mistake. This CD borders on unlistenable, with no discernable melody/talent to be found. I'm hardly some ignorant pop-music lover...I consider "Blueberry Boat" to be one of my favorite records - but this is just horrible
At the tine it was unsurpassed in spectacle and scope, and has held up remarkably well, despite a few touches of typical silent overacting/heavy-handedness. Still, the 1925 Hur belongs in any collector's collection for its importance in film history. Not to mention the fact that it sealed MGM's financial future. So of course, as of this writing, the greedy oinkers at the studios haven't released it on DVD because it won't sell 4 million copies
So this controller looked pretty sweet to me so I bought it over a rumble pad. I liked the idea of fans for wicking away sweat, as I tend to get pretty white knuckled on my controllers. I bought this controller specifically for Star Wars Battlefront 2 on PC, and it works like a dream. I also like the X-Box controller layout (offset anolog sticks and more ergonomic) than the PS2 style controller that is the Logitech Rumble pad. It also has better grips than a PS2 controller. ---  --- The only things I think are bad about it are the following: --- 1. It is not modeled on the large XBox controller, but rather the regular one, which is ok for most people, but I have big hands and I get a bit cramped up if I play for way too long. --- 2. I was slightly dissapointed with the lack of custimization software available with this pad. I have a Saitek Cyborg EVO joystick that you can create custom profiles for every game you want to use it with then set that profile before launching the game. This isn't an issue with Battlefront 2 since it has a very excellent in game control configurator, but I could see where if a game didn't have as good an interface (or maybe older games) this pad could suffer in this regard. --- 3. This isn't so much an issue for me, but I would assume that with a lot of game play and turning on and off of the fan, that the fan motor will likely die sooner than the pad will wear out. I don't care too much, because the fan is more a novelty to me than anything. I will still use it even if it does die. ---  --- Overall, a great controller, I actually would give it a 4.5 rating, but that isn't an option here
The scanner worked as promised .The only thing was I had no place to plug the scanner in on my computer. To solve the problem I bought an adapter plug from the nine pin on the scanner wire to a USB which I can plug into the computer.I'm still working on getting past just reading error codes and clearing the check engine light
Installed quickly, great image quality, but within three days the card started to overheat and cause the computer to reboot. I was told by others and ATI forums that the 1650 pro with ATI stock heat sink is KNOWN for its problems. Do not buy 1650 Pro unless sapphire or other upgraded coolant system on the card.  --- Also note, this may be an unrelated issue, after so many crashes the motherboard was fried and needed to be replaced. Cannot tell if related to video card or not yet.   --- If you are wanting an ATI stock card, there have been no known issues regarding stock cooling with the AGP 1800 & 1900 series cards.
This product is amazing. After learning my husband was taking me to Mexico for our 25th anniversary, I was nervous about going into a foreign country without knowing any Spanish. This game is amazing. It is the fastest way to learn a language without the long drawn out grammar explanations. Afterall, I just wanted to learn the basics, phrases for restaurants, banks, airports, shopping etc. This game was so much fun, you couldn't tear me or my husband off the computer. We kept wanting to play because learning was so much fun. The phrases I learned contributed to a much more enjoyable trip and now I have enrolled at the local community college to further my Spanish. This product is perfect for any one travelling and wanting to learn the phrases and colloquial expression fast
No one will doubt that Woody Allen is the only director who has consistently mastered the art of writing and directing intelligent, funny, unforgettable stories.  These films are great examples of that. Fromk Annie Hall to Sleeper [I haven't viewed Stardust Memories yet], you will be completely satisfied with your purchase. Here's an overview of the films: ---  --- Annie Hall: Allem's best film, hands down.  The story of a couple who meets in a New York tennis club.  Allen plays Alvy Singer, a carbon copy of Allen's stereotypical self [neurotic, clumsy, "suave"], while Keaton, who gives a stunning performance, plays Annie Hall, a country girl from Wisconsin trying to find a life in New York. A great story about relationships. The last paragraph that Allen narrates is fabulous. Don't watch this film first, or you may not appreciate Allen's other work as much! ---  --- Bananas: On the sillier side, this film is about Fielding Mellish, another character based on himself.  Mellish works for a large corporation. Testing products. If you are at all familiar with Allen, you already know that there is a witty scene coming up.  Mellish travels to the small Latin American country of San Marcos to find something to do. He ends up becoming the communist dictator there, and that is all I will say. ---  --- Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* *But were afraid to ask: A great satire on the popular book. This is a series of seven small sex stories, varying from Gene Wilder's affair with a sheep to a giant, deadly mammary. Watch for Allen's coolest role as Fabrizio, the Italian. ---  --- Interiors: A stunning film [very serious] about a wealthy Long Island family that steers away from the mother. This film is beautifully shot, and it really pays a lot of attention to showing every aspect of every character. Tension builds quickly, and it stays until the end.  ---  --- Love and Death: One of my personal top five Allen films.  This one is about Napoleon trying to take over Russia. Allen plays Boris Grushenko, a Russian Catholic, who falls in love with his distant cousin, Sonja [Keaton].  This one is nonstop laughs, but only if you are familiar with the war and the works of Russian writers. It is still very funny otherwise, but not as deeply funny.  ---  --- Manhattan: Similar to Annie Hall, but a little different.  Allen plays Isaac Davis, who falls in love with a seventeen year old [Mariel Hemingway], and also with Mary [Keaton], an overly pretentious New Yorker at the same time. This story is again about relationship, but this one is extreme. Shot in black and white, and accompanied by a George Gershwin soundtrack, many Allen fans consider this film his love letter to New York City.  It is also considered his best by many people. I think he has made better, but this is a stunning film. ---  --- Sleeper: Sleeper is 'Love and Death' set in the future. A great film about Allen, who is frozen in 1973, and defrosted 200 years later. Great jokes, chase scenes, and more. In one scene, Diane Keaton and a leader of a revolutionist underground organization re-create scenes from his childhood. Another joke about the NRA. Sleeper is probably the best film to see if one wants a good introduction to Allen's style.  ---  --- All in all, this collection is a must-own. Also, at less than ten dollars per DVD, no fan should pass this up. Separately, they cost more. Buy this today and you will be granted a good taste in motion pictures
I read some of the other reviews before I submitted this.  I don't see how someone could get upset over the liner notes.  Redd doesn't include Danny Gatton as an influence because he didn't listen to him.  As far as other reviews concerning tone and the lack of fire, well, I don't even know how to address that.  Redd has one of the best tones I've heard on the tele and his note selection is what sets him apart from other pickers.  Ever hear of diarrhea of the guitar?  Well, you won't get that on this CD because Redd doesn't play something to just play it.  This CD showcases Redd's versatility from country, to swing, to blues, to rock, it has it all.  If you like good pickin', then by this CD
We were very pleased with the service we received.  Our purchases were shipped in a timely fashion and came in good condition
While well produced, I was disappointed in the album - mostly because the majority of the tracks were re-recordings.  Frankie Laine still sounds great - but it just wasn't the same. ---  --- I bought the CD to replace a well worn vinyl album, but on listening to the CD I found the songs to all be slightly (and in a couple of cases very), different in tempo and vocal inflection - it's definitely not the album I've loved for over 30 years!  High Noon in particular is quite different, much slower, with vocal emphasis changed.  I'll probably listen to the CD from time to time, but not with the same relish that I enjoyed my old LP
It's always good to see an artist change and try new things. Back in 2003 when Jewel did, it was a big deal. Everyone accused her of selling out, which I think is unfair. This disc, while different, is just not what I would call Jewel at her best. I found "America" somewhat enjoyable and "Run 2 U" was also, but the rest of the CD did not sit well with me. I did give her a second chance and recently bought her 2006 CD, Goodbye, and I must say, it's Jewel slowly regaining her musicality. Also glad to here that she will be making a country CD next, it will fit her voice well. --- 
"This was the first sales book I ever read. And today, 10 years later, I have it proudly displayed in my library. When I speak with clients who I now teach sales skills to, I still reference it from back in my days selling copiers in 1994. Way to go Stephan!"
First off, let me start by saying that I really like my Summit watch.  It is large (some may go so far to call it HUGE) but it is surprisingly lightweight on my wrist, and quite comfortable to wear.  Those with bad eyesight will STILL be able to see the easy-to-read digital readout of the time, barometric pressure, altitude and compass.  The numbers are quite big, so they are difficult to miss.   ---  --- The altitude reading measures in increments of +/- 1 foot, which is about as good as you can get.  I like that.  But what I really like about the Highgear watches that I haven't seen in other brands which offer similar features, is the visual image on the face of the watch telling you what the weather conditions are or will be.  No kidding, this watch will actually show you whether or not it is sunny, partly cloudy, or raining.  Pretty dang nifty if you ask me.  The barometric pressure reading is only a small part of predicting the weather, however after months of use, I have to say that my little watch is WAY MORE accurate than my local TV Weatherman.  I'd say somewhere around 75% of the time what my watch says is exactly what the conditions actually ARE.  Not bad.  It's a feature I would VERY much like to have on my Suunto and Casio models with similar functions.  Until then, I'll rely on my trusty (and much cheaper) Highgear Summit. ---  --- If you are considering making the purchase of a wrist watch that offers the digital compass, altitude and barometer functions, before MAKING that specific buy, do some homework and wherever possible, seek out a store where you can actually SEE the watches in person.  Being able to guess the size of a particular model using a picture on the computer can possibly mess up your purchase.  Find the best price, and pull the model out and actually TRY IT ON before you buy.  For me, the Highgear Summit was a good purchase -- however if you would rather enjoy these same functions but in a smaller package, try the Highgear Axis, or possibly the more stylish but much more compact (and WAY MORE expensive) Suunto Observer.  Either way, doing a little homework will pay off in the end.  Happy hiking and I hope this helps you in your efforts to buy the right product.  Good luck
As a fan of zombie movies and as someone who enjoyed City of the Living Dead and Zombie, I was very disappointed with House by the Cemetery. Fulci manages to create a good mystery in the first two-thirds of the movie, only to squander it on some poorly executed scare scenes. ---  --- House By the Cemetery is about an researcher (whose work is never specified) who moves his wife and his kid into a house in Massachussets in order to finish out the work of a colleague who killed himself and his mistress. The titular house is the only place they can really find for the moment, so Dr. Boyle, his wife Lucy and their son Bob move in despite a lot of bad signs, like the boarded-up door to the cellar and a tombstone for a Dr. Jacob Tess Freudstein in the front hall. Bob has little red-headed girl for a friend who keeps warning him about how bad the house is (though no one else sees her). Furthermore, people keep claiming Dr. Boyle has been in town before with a non-existent daughter (which he denies, not totally convincingly). He also seems to have some secret relationship with the babysitter, Anne, who starts unboarding the cellar door in the middle of the night. And Lucy seems to either be recovering from or suffering from serious psychological issues.  ---  --- Got that? Good, because half of that stuff never gets explained. The only things that get worked out are the little red-headed girl's identity and the identity of the killer (neither of which are that hard to figure out). There are some nice visual moments in the earlier parts of the film (the fact that the killer has one normal hand and one rotting hand, the photograph that changes with each viewing, a mannequin that gets beheaded and starts bleeding) but Fulci's ability to handle the gore moments disappoints. He lingers too long over some deaths, makes the killer so ridiculously slow that a snail could outrun him and bits like the babysitter's head falling down the stairs come off as funny rather than scary. Compared to the injury to the eye scene in Zombie or Christopher George chopping through the coffin in CotLD, Dr. Boyle's chopping through the door around his son's head feels like self-parody. ---  --- Fulci's other films have incoherent plots , but rarely in a way that seems to work against the plot (the dream-like nature of City of the Living Dead seems appropriate given the prophetic dream the heroine gets and the mystical nature of the threat) and the execution of the setpieces is usually fantastic. House by the Cemetery has neither thing working in its favor. It's not Hell of the Living Dead-level bad, but the fact that it has some genuinely good acting (especially Paolo Malco, who plays Dr. Boyle) and an interesting set-up almost make the flaws worse. ---  --- Also, this version has a "never before seen deleted scene", but it has no sound and is just an extended reaction shot after the bat attack
After looking at the other reviews, I was a bit puzzled.  I haven't had any of the problems other folks mention. PDF Converter Professional 4 doesn't do everything that programs costing FIVE TIMES as much money.  But, WHO CARES?  Background colors in a business form?  WHY????   ---  --- Don't buy a Camry and say "gee... I liked my Lexus better." ---  --- Most of you are going to buy this program to do one - or both - of these two things:  ---   --- 1)CONVERT PDF DOCUMENTS into completely editable Word docs, Excel Worksheets, or one of dozens of other formats... ---  --- 2)COMBINE documents of various formats into a single pdf. Picture a CUSTOMER MANUAL that consists of Word, Excel, SolidWorks, Quicken, PowerPoint and Project documents.   You want to put them all together in ONE document complete with Table of Contents, Bookmarks and Thumbnails.  VOILA!  This is the proram for you!  ---  --- And for these purposes, PDF 4 Professional is SUPERB.  It is EASY to use. We have SEVERAL users, and not one has had to refer to a manual or on line support.  ---  --- To put PDF Converter to the test, we recently scanned, then saved-as-a-pdf a crooked, not highly legible fax.  We THEN converted it into a Word document, and roughly 90% of it came through perfectly.  AMAZING. ---  --- HIGHLY Recommended
Excellent 24 track compilation of this surperb psychedelic Dutch band. Each tune was a single sometime between 1965-69. These guys are NOT to be confused with a U.S. band from the same era of the same name. Cuts that make this CD a true keeper are "Sun's Going Down", the tripping "Feel Like I Wanted To Cry", "Keep On Trying", the familiar sounding "Touch" and "Ballad Of John B". This is yet ANOTHER band I've heard at least one or two tracks on the Rhino release of 'Original Artyfacts: Nuggets II' 4-CD box set.Should appeal to fans of Pretty Things,Q65,early Beatles,Creation and The Action.A must-have
The Sony Cybershot is a great camera. The colors and the features are amazing. Is very easy to use. The only thing I dont like about the camera is the zoom in and out button. If you zoomed in you wont be able to zoom out.
I remember when "Doom 3" first came out there was a lot of hype on the Internet. People were claiming it would blow away the release of "Half-Life 2" with id's new engine, etc. etc. etc. ---  --- Unfortunately, "Doom 3" is a rather standard shoot-'em-up. It's fun for a little while, but it lacks the originality and inventiveness of games like "Half-Life 2" (which was amazing). "Half-Life" kept me engaged because the terrain changes; the characters change; and so on. In "Doom 3" it's basically just a lot of walking around through dimly-lit corridors. Monsters jump out and you kill them. It's fun for a while but then it becomes tiring - much like a haunted house ride would become tiring after five hours straight. ---  --- Furthermore the graphics engine really isn't what everyone made it out to be. I just bought a new PC this year and it runs this game very well on maximum settings - the gameplay isn't choppy or anything. But even at full potential with graphics I think they're just "OK." The shadowing is brilliant but the textures are average and some of the characters in the cut-scenes are downright laughable - one of the Commanders early on looks like a character from "AvP 2," and that game came out in 2001! ---  --- The in-game play is much better - characters look more realistic - but I have to wonder what the rush was with the cut-scenes. One would think they'd spend more attention to detail on these. ---  --- Overall I have to admit that while I found this fun at times it gets tedious after a while. I mean, the gimmick with the flashlight is annoying (as someone else pointed out) - I think in the beginning it's okay but they should have planted an upgrade early on in the game, such as a helmet with a flashlight attached to the top; or nightvision goggles that last for a minute or two before they have to be recharged; because dropping your flashlight and picking up a weapon while you're being shot at by enemies is annoying. ---  --- And as another reviewer pointed out, the PDA gimmick gets old fast. ---  --- Overall this has moments of absolute brilliance but I felt like so much more could have been done with it. They should have abandoned the concept of being "alone in the dark" throughout the entire game and done a bit more with it - I would have loved to have explored the Martian planet more or even levels that don't look exactly the same. Because the repetitive nature of the game is ultimately what sinks it. ---  --- It's good, but I think "Half-Life 2" was far better and the graphics engine on HL was stunning, even two years later
I purchased two pairs of these boots for my teenage daughter who lives in this type of Ugg-like boots. We looked in stores and other online shoe sites for Uggs and other alternatives but being the end of the season, couldn't find her size.  We saw these on Amazon in her size and thought we'd try them out.  They were definitely worth it!  They are just as warm and comfortable as Uggs and since the price was so good, we were able to buy two pairs.  They are nicely made, comfortable, and attractive. She's wears them almost everyday so they are proving to be pretty durable. She is really choosy about her footwear and she absolutely loves these boots
Despite the description and synopsis on the books cover this is NOT a computer crime novel. In fact with the exception of about 20 pages total the novel quickly looses its snazzy cyber crime appeal. In the first few pages we're introduced to a dark haired female hacker but just as quickly she's gone and the book spirals into Japanese gangs, corrupt police, horribly bland and indistinguishable characters, and it just sucks from then on out. The story is good albeit incorrectly marketed. The characters however have no identity! They all sound the same, with the exception of the Japanese characters. Sadly the book lacks serious writing talent, very little character development, on what could've been a good story. One positive note perhaps is that the descriptions of Japanese culture, etc. are really good. Perhaps this is due to the authors departure many years before from England to Japan. My advice: spend some time abroad again
 ---    It's a very nice phone!!!!!!
I wish the review written in January was posted before I bought this thing.  I bought this as a present and the exact thing happened.  The cable snapped after only 2 weeks of use.  The ad states it holds 250lbs, but when you get it...the item states 220, which she was still below that, but the cable snapped anyway....STAY AWAY FROM THIS ITEM...FAR FAR AWAY. 
This is the definitive lesbian love story that launched the genre in a new direction.  Out of the dirty bars and masculine flannel shirts, away from the creepy angst of punks.  This wonderful love story brings lesbian love into the light of day with beautiful women, looking and acting sexy, and leading productive, respectable lives.  WHY NOT portray lesbians as beautiful, educated, clean, classy, talented, sober, drug-free, non-violent, non-"self-destructive", straight forward, honest...oh, and truly SEXY??  The Reno landscape in the 50's is a great backdrop for the conflicts that lesbians encountered.  The filming is top notch, the sets and period clothing are spot on.  The musical scores are superb!   --- The cast was wonderful!  Charbonneau and Shavers are sensational as total opposites who eventually become drawn and attrated to each other.  Just a masterful duette of performances!  Cay, free and fully out, forward and knowing just what she wants; Vivian, tentative and reluctant to step outside of her cultured and closed box.  Every minute they spend with each other oozes electricity and sexual tension. Two georgeous women making love??  HELLO!  The love scene is landmark.  Audra Lindley is wonderful and perfectly cast as Cay's stepmom.  Cay's best friend, Silver, is absolutely a key role in the dynamics of these chracters; she is the definative support and validation that these women are wonderful people, and deserve love and happiness.  We all need a little "Silver" in our lives!!  --- This story is completely intriguing, and HEY, what a wonderful ending!  SEQUEL, SEQUEL!!! This is an absolute must have in any collection.  Timeless tale of the beauty of lesbian love.  
I brought this after having played Caesar3 and loved it but wanted something with a bit more scope for controlling dynamics of a city - and I thought being a civcity game this would offer me the extension - WRONG - this is a bad rip off of Caesar3, sure, graphics are more advanced with the zoom in view but other than that I was playing the same game but with less involvement or control. This is a sit back and let it happen to you game - keep the people happy and build everything and they'll stay. Caesar IV - that's what you're wanting, it looks like everything this sets itself up to be that it isn't. Feel like I've wasted my money
Wow, I have absolutely no problems with this headset whatsoever. Clear sound-great range-and most of all its gorgeous. Turns heads all over the place. Man I feel high tech with this thing on. I payed $30.00 off of ebay, but that was a rare deal. Still Amazons price cannot be beat. Buy it, youll love it
not as much coverage as i would like for my mildly ruddy complexion but it definitely smoothes out skin texture and moisturizes very well.
 FIT IS PERFECT.  VERY COMFORTABLE.  4 STARS.   WOULD PURCHASE AGAIN. ---                               MARY S
When this product came, it says "girls" - not a woman's size.  I'm a petite woman 5'2 105lbs and the medium was too tight for me - like a jr's size or "girls" size as the tag states.  Now I have to spend $$ sending this product back
Loving the look of the Rolex Daytona, I spotted this watch on Amazon and just had to have one (at the price). --- Arrived in a well padded display box, with all parts of the watch and strap covered in a protective plastic - so no scratches. --- Taking out a few links for that custom fit just took a couple of minutes. --- The watch looks great - better than the images on the Web - and it works as described. --- Other posters that have had issues should read the manual! It does all of the chrono functions, and has full adjustments for hand alignment etc. - Fantastic
I just received these and popped 'em in and I'm listening to MP3s on my PC.  At first, one of sides was really weak in volume.  In the process of testing the balance in my software, I accidentally cranked up the volume way to high for these guys, but that apparently did the trick.  Now both are equal, and sound good.   --- There is decent bass, but the highs are a bit soft.  A quick tweak to my equalizer, and they're great.  After reading several of the reviews on Amazon, I was a bit worried about the sound, but now that I have them I'm very happy.  They're a good price, and sooooo much better than the little ipod-like earbuds I've tried before.  Those never stayed in my ear, and the bass never made me happy.   ---  --- Summary: --- These Jbuds stay in my ear, have good sound (not great, but I think good for $20), and have equal length cords from each ear
This is much more interesting as a visual chronicle of 1982 New York (there are generous aerial views, lots of location shooting, etc.) than as a horror movie, even a cheesy one.  The special effects are used extremely sparingly, with the word "special" being a definite overstatement.  Some amusing performances somewhat redeem the proceedings, but not by much.  In the end, "Q, The Winged Serpent" is watchable and certainly not horribly bad, but it's hard to imagine this being anybody's favorite horror movie or even guilty pleasure.  To end on a positive note, the DVD features a clean, sharp print of the film.  
I just lost my synch adapter and it is on back order everywhere.  Unfortunately this is necessary to connect to computer and to charge the player.  Earliest date I can find one is 10/23 due to some shipping problem with creative labs.  I'm at a loss now that the battery is dead.  This is the dumbest idea ever.  Why didn't they design the player so that the cords attached directly to the player?  I agree that you should order a back-up as this thing is so easy to lose and so important
Purchased the rotisserie basket after reading the other reviews. I have found the basket to work great. You put your meat in to be grilled and clamp down the pieces. Very easy. With Rock cornish game hens though, I needed to tie them a little bit, but that is because the little legs are . . .well little. Never had one before just the skewer kind. Cleans fairly easy too. Love it.
The chair has good back support and fits a 6 ft tall man well with even a little extra wood to support the head. ---  --- My stool arrived with the wood split so check it before the driver takes off if you can. ---  --- Mind the instructions when you are putting it together.  If you don't watch the bolts and the small blurry print on the step by step notes you can get turned around. ---  --- Also, the wood is almost orange in it's color
I absolutely love Charlotte Church's voice, but I couldn't stand even 1 song on this CD.  She's lowered herself to a "Brittany Spears-wanna-be."  ---  --- Monotone songs, horrible bass, every song sounds the same.  I am extremely disappointed in this collection of music.   ---  --- Buy this one and you're just wasting your money. ---  --- Would the REAL Charlotte Church please come back????
I bought this for my son's first birthday.  He loved it!  But, after only a month it stopped quacking and he lost most interest in it.  He still plays with it a little bit, but not like when it made noise.  I wouldn't have wasted my money if I had known the batteries would only last a month
I just bought this camera and took it to one of my kid's indoor soccer games. The light was low, but not that low.  You should be able to take a picture without the flash. When I took the flash off, the picture looked fine on the preview, but came out completely black.  Yet the camera was able to take perfectly fine video at the same light level!  What a disappointment.  I am going to try to return it
This is a new low, even for our feminazi-drenched anti-culture.  The whole message of this whore of a doll is to tell impressionable little girls that being superficial, arrogant, shallow and slutty are positive attributes, desirable & healthy, and that by contrast, having true strength of character, integrity, honor and modesty are for 'losers.'  In other words, looking and behaving like a skank tramp = "empowerment."  That term has been SO misued over the last 30 years (and particularly the last 10), that it ceases to have any truth to it whatsoever.  Barbie used to epitomize what it meant to be feminine, a lady, and fulfilled -- with a husband, a home and children.  Now that standard has been completely perverted and ruined with the onset of dolls like this -- exchanging true values (being a good wife and mother) for false ones (materialism and promiscuity).  Even Barbie's face has been uglified -- grossly overdone mascara/eyeliner and collagened-out lips -- resembling those hideous whored-out Bratz dolls.  Realize -- this is a WAR on our children's souls! ---  --- Mattel should be ashamed of themselves, to the hilt.  This is child abuse, pure and simple.  Any mother who allows their child to get one of these monstrosities should be jailed for neglect and have her tubes tied
This item had a description for ages three and up.  This isn't even close.  Now I'm stuck with a toddler toy for a five-year-old who is so attached to the fact it's a Batmobile he can get in, even if his knees practically knock at his chin, that I'll never pry it from him.  He's only going to be able to  even get in it for probably two more months.  It was a complete waste of money.  It's suited for two to three-year-olds and small four-year-olds
The product works very well, but might prove a little flimsy if one is not careful connecting the phone. Overall, I would recommend it if the user pays attention when connecting. Great buy for the price
A couple of years ago, my friend Rockie brought back some samples of Market Spice tea from Seattle. Everyone loved it! It has a strong spicy orange flavor. I am so glad it is now available at Amazon
I use my inversion table two or three times a day for short intervals of a few minutes each whenever my lower back starts --- to hurt or tighten up. Shorter and less intensive periods of  --- use achieve better results that longer and fewer periods of --- use.

I wanted to convert an HP LaserJet 4 Plus to a networked printer. Even though instructions from the manual was followed, the printer did not work. The customer support is claimed to be 24/7, but no one has closed my help desk ticket yet. This product cost more than a linksys router. So customers can naturally expect better customer service and better response time
Used this book all of the time in my German classes!  Wish I had had this sooner, would have made everything a lot simpler.  Its easy to use, easy to understand, and great when you need to find something quick.  This should be a book every college student, studying German, should be required to have
This was a very revealing look into how steroids played a role in baseball player success starting in the 1980s. This was an influential book which began a congressional search into the use of Steroids in baseball.
My son absolutely loves his "animals". He can sit and play with the book for awhile. He's 20 months old and knows where each picture belongs. It was a great gift and I recommend it! I do agree with the other reviews regarding the dinosaurs.
Audre Hepburns debut.  This ismy favorite movie of all time.  A romantic comedy whose characters have the highest integrity of any film I've ever viewed.  If you're not moved by this story and it's portrayal by command performances, then you're not breathing
I bought this to convert some .AVI and .MOV files so I could try video podcasting with a web multimedia class I teach.  I've done this successfully with a shareware product, but thought the resulting video could be a little sharper, so I was willing to pay for and try a commerical product.  (Pinnacle, right?  They do a lot of this stuff, they must know what they're doing . . . . )  HA!!!!  HUGE mistake.  The interface is horrible, and the conversion just-plain-sucks.  Everything came out in flouescent colors with huge blocks covering the screen.  Totally, completely unwatchable.  It looks like a 60s psychedellic experience, like "motion art," not like a proper video at all.  Avoid this product!!
I searched a long time for a cushion to fit an old lounge chair which had slightly larger measurements for the new cushions at most stores today.  Horray!!!!!!!!!!  This one is perfect and has served me well for comfort and weather resistance.  It has been an unusually rainy month of May and the cushion justs dries with little or no wiping.  So comfortable too
This card table is very sturdy. The legs are solidly locked in place, both when extended and when stored. The top appears to be durable. Overall, this appears to be a quality product
I found these shoes by searching the women's option for running shoes.  The name may say Unisex, but there is no indication that the sizing is 100% male.  Not even a note stating that a woman should subtract 2 or 3 or 10 sizes from her normal shoe size.  ---  --- When the shoes arrived here, they were huge. I tried to return them, but Amazon considers this to be MY fault, and planned to charge back any shipping, promotions and coupons against a possible refund.  I had done very well using a coupon, a sale, a "buy $80 worth of shoes and get $20 off instantly" promotion and Amazon prime, so my "refund" would be less than nothing.  ---  --- That's right -- if I return the shoes, I owe money.  Because Amazon made no mention that shoes found in the women's section of the site might be men's shoes instead.  Yeah, that seems fair
I used to own a brush from another manufacturer.  It never brushed well: the heads wore out waaaaaaaay too quickly.  I just never felt I was getting a good brush. ---  --- After using this brush for about a couple of months, I went in for a regular checkup.  My dentist told me my teeth had never looked better.  That's all the testimony I need
I plugged the receiver into my game controller and followed the directions to get the controller to communicate with the receiver.  The receiver light kept blinking which means that it didn't recognize the controller. After several tries I decided that the product is defective and returned it
Super comfortable.  Provides great support/coverage.  Love the front zipper.  No fighting to get over your head. 
I bought this thing and put it in my garage for about a month. One night I saw a mouse running across my stove so I brought it in and put it directly on the stovetop. Later that evening I was washing dishes, and the mouse ran back and forth from behind my microwave with his little cheeks full of Shake'n'Bake RIGHT PAST THE RODENT REPELLANT FIVE TIMES!!
But no calories count. ---  --- I love this watch despite that, it's well designed, the chest strap also links to the machines in the gym (most that say POLAR ready).. so that was a great surprise ---  --- The chest strap has a battery that is user-serviceable as well as the watch, so you don't have to send it to the manufacturer (like the POLAR HR). ---  --- Overall I think is a good buy, but the is missing the calories count, that would be my only upgrade.
Ordered a pair...and they lost my first order.  Had to contact amazon to help. Finally got order..and pants were too small. So..had to RE order larger size.  Got pants in SAME size as last. Wrote back saying I know have TWO pair of pants that are too small.     --- First they denied sending wrong size..then later wrote back saying they did make a mistate and that new order in correct size was on its way with postage lables to send pants back. Well a month later still have not recieved pants or lables.  Have wrote half a dozen emails asking for a reply and help..NO REPLY.  Never had such POOR customer service
This parking assist works as described.  Its easy to install but the laser doesn't stay on long enough and even with the car in motion the light sometimes goes off before the car comes to a stop because it doesn't detect motion on the smooth, one-color surface.  My wife can't see the light on the front of the hood because she line of view is lower than mine, however, I find it working fine

I love the new digital Canon. The only problem is it's not nearly as tough as it's film twin.  I had the camera less than a month when the pop-up flash quit working.  The Canon people have been great, and very helpful, but I'd rather not have had to send a brand new camera back to the factory.  The photos, however, are wonderful.  Film quality for the most part - printable and enlargable.  (It would probably be better to use the camera with a tripod when using the 300mm telephoto but I hike with it, so just remember to steady it before taking wildlife photos.
I gave this picture frame to my wife for a christmas gift,we pluged it in and within a half an hour it made a loud bang and smoke poured out of the thing like crazy....not a good gift.
This pen needs gel ink to make it perfect.  The regular ink is often difficult to get flowing.  But it does the job.  PenAgain products were the only ones that caused me no pain after surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome and tennis elbow
We bought this toy for our 1 year old son.  It is very sturdy and well made and the blocks inside are great.  I agree with the other reviews that the wagon moves to fast on wood floors and it does not turn well. --- My biggest compaint, however, is that when both lids are closed, the wagon looks just like a 2-step ladder.  Our son constantly tries to climb it, like stairs.  The other day, he finally stood up on top of the wagon and the wagon tipped straight over onto the handle.  My son fell over with it and crashed on his face.  There are two rubber stoppers on the back of the wagon, but they DO NOT prevent it from falling over. --- My son is fine, but this toy is very dangerous and I do not recommend it!
We love the watch. It's totally adjustable, press the button for glow-in-the-dark feature. The two lizards "chase" each other around the watch. Too cute
Never owned one of these electric jobs before. Could not believe how good it felt and how clean my teeth felt and looked. Hated brushing my teeth before and now I will look forward to the experience. Never wanted to spend the money before but now they are at an affordable price point. Why not have 2 and get all the different heads for a real professional clean?  --- Everyone should have one.
i bought this 5 pound bag of candy because the reviews were all beaming about how good these are and i've bought the gummy frogs in the past and liked those so i thought i'd give this a try. These are gross... not only that, but they're huge. i recommend the gummi frogs as a better alternative. Now i know to try out the candy in a smaller portion first,before investing in my next 5 pound bag. 2 stars because well it's not fair to people who like these to say they are absolutely terrible, but still, now i have a 5 pound bag of candy i have to get rid of
There is a cure from your liberal disease. Take a non-partisan journey with Dr Savage and open your so called liberal mind to the truth.  ---  --- And remember Conservative and Wacko are polar opposites
These bootie/slippers are terrible.  They don't EVER stay on, there's no anti-skid on the bottom and are cheaply made.  I would give these 0 stars if I could, it was a complete waste of money- don't bother getting these regadless of how inexpensive they are
I've owned several watches, including the older G-Shock and the Casio Men's G-Shock Atomic Solar Watch # GW1400DA-9AV (among others). ---  --- First, there are so many G-shock models to choose from. You could have bought the # GW1400DA-9AV (the stainless steel model) for the same price ($75) during the week of July 24, 2006. ---  --- This watch simply has everything one ever needs for time functionality: solar power (no need for daily rewinding, kinetic body movement, or batteries), synch with the atomic clock in Colorado (ultimate accuracy), time zone adjustment (ease for jet setters), light button (which also goes off when you tilt your wrist), stop watch functionalities, day/date functionalities, and countless other time-related functions. In this respect, it's much more functional than a Patek (even the complicated wrist watch models, or the more mundane Rolex, etc.). Of course, it's a lowly Casio, costing a mere $75 (vs. $75,000 for a low end complicated Patek) ---  --- Buyers should be aware that the watch is purtty bulky, probably 5/8 to 3/4 in. thick. One needs a sporty forearm/wrist to go with this watch. ---  --- For the fun of wearing it couple times a year, the price, and just to look at it as part of a collection of watches, I'd highly recommend it.
I've installed and tested this for several clients.  Whether backing up to a local HD or over the network, the system has worked; I install and come back a week later to do a test verify and restore, and it's always worked.  I did have trouble once; Windows froze up.  This was probably due to poor programming combined with insufficient RAM; it worked the second time. ---  --- I don't get why a product with mostly single star ratings like this still gets 2.5 stars.  Annoying Amazon 'feature'! ---  --- Since 60% of Windows PCs are malware-infected, I'm figuring most Windows PC support issues are malware-induced. 
Okay, maybe the heading exagerates just a tad... Red Popcorn has a MUCH more tender husk than regular popcorn does and when it pops, it explodes the kernel so well that the husks basically disappear.  When it pops, it looks pretty much like any other popcorn, except that the popped kernels are slightly smaller than usual.  The meet is white, but you can see the little bits of red kernel in them.  You would never know that the pretty, white popcorn you were eating started out red-colored if you hadn't seen it before popping. ---  --- The flavor is great!  It smelled "toastier" as it was popping than other popcorns we've tried.  We tried it all different ways, with toppings ranging from sweet to savory and every way was good. ---  --- We also liked the fact that it is grown by Amish people and are happy to support their efforts to raise their crops the "old way."  They believe in sustainable farming and a clean, wholesome way of life.  No ConAgra multi-national conglomerates here, just real, individual farmers making a living off their land. ---  --- Great products raised and produced by real farmers.  What better reasons do you need to buy some of this really tasty popcorn!
Great concept, but bad design. Both of my children have had one for a year. Due to the discomfort, they never use it! It needs to recline back further and the plastic is slippery making it hard to sit without slipping around
Okay, the rating above is not going to be liked but I have to be truthful. ---  --- The only good thing going for this movie was the return of "Snake Plissken". ---  --- This film's plot was essentially a rehash of the original "Escape From New York"...A bit more special effects (which in fact, did not make this a better movie)...  ---  --- When I go to a sequel I expect to get what I paid for a totally new adventure with the same character / characters. ---  --- Kurt Russell's character is older and even more in the know of what the rewards are before he is offered them. ---   --- Obviously the movie doesn't really know where it's going as it takes two scenes (15 minutes of the film) (1st scene - President, Commandant, and Lackey give Snake the mission) (2nd scene - Commandant and Lackey brief Snake before he leaves for the mission)  to explan to the audience what's the basic conflict. ---  --- I guess either Carpenter or Russell are just getting too old to take a GREAT leap and recount either an earlier Snake Plissken adventure or an adventure well worth telling.. ---  --- I also wish to comment that this disc has no special features besides a movie trailer... --- "Carpenter....Russell! " Please don't tell me "money" caused you to revisit a "cult figure"!  ---  --- Some redeeming qualities are the acting performances of  Cliff Robertson, Stacy Keach, Steve Buscemi, and Pam Grier.  Robertson, Keach, and Grier may be old but they can sure make you believe in their characters! ---  --- Sorry, Snake...."I don't love L.A." ---  --- The-Big-Green-Pointy-Eared-One! 
Ace rolls out its second volume of early girl and girl-led group sounds.  This time, there are six tunes that did not make it into the top 100 and that may seem to be a bit of a letdown in content but when looking at the overall repertoire, this series still beats just about anything else of the genre out there.  With enough (ten) top-10 songs to keep the music familiar, there are lots of seldom-found sides making the listening much more interesting and not sounding like every other oldies comp.  Between such monster hits as Lesley Gore's pre-womens' rights anthem "You Don't Own Me", the Exciters go-and-get-him "Tell Him" and Kathy Young's barely pubescent "A Thousand Stars" are cradled such rarities as the Secrets' "The Boy Next Door" (a Madara-White, of "You Don't Own Me" and other Gore tunes fame, composition ), April Stevens' "Teach Me Tiger" (later with brother Nino Tempo striking it big with "Deep Purple") and Timi Yuro's (of "Hurt" fame) "What's A Matter Baby".  In this volume three of the tracks are acknowledged as having been lifted from disc but only track 10 is of substandard sound quality even so.  Many of the tracks (2,3,6,8,12-15,17,23,25,28) appear in stereo, the remainder in mono.  The 16-page booklet accompaning the disc provides pages of fascinating backround to the artists represented.  Ace again hits the mark with this new compilation
It was pretty damn funny! ---  --- This movie was recommended by my good friend, Bobby Asslong.  In most cases his recommendations are a bunch of [...], but he hit it right on, with this one!  I detest Tom Green.  He is one of those guys, who that when he fails at something (Talk Show, most of his movies, life) I actually feel happy.  And this is actually contrary to my normal personality.  I normally automatically love all Canadians.  Just kidding. I normally want people to succeed, and feel bad when they fail.   ---  --- But Tom Green is so annoying. ---  --- Great news!  He is in only about 4 or 5 scenes in this whole movie, so you should be able to get through this movie, with little to none hatred for Mr. Green. ---  --- I love all the characters in this movie, especially the main protagonist, who accidentally sends the videotape to his girlfriend at a far away college.  He is very likeable, and you're pulling for him the whole time.  Another thing I like this movie, is that it pulls a lot from other "gross out" teen and college flicks, but it doesn't go overboard in the gross out department. ---  --- Tom Green plays the Voice Over explainer in the movie, and he actually does a pretty good job, without appearing stupid.   ---  --- I give this high reviews! ---  --- MC White said:  Check it out!!
beautiful color, but very small in size, i guess i should have checked he pearl size first instead of just looking at the pictur
my sister have been uesing it since i bought it for her and i think she like it 
I was very disappointed with this purchase, since I have always been an Under Armour supporter. These gloves felt like I was wearing a material that sped up the onset of frost bite to my hands! Definitely not for cold weather, don't waste your money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Great recipes that truly are quick and easy.  Low to no-fat with healthful ingredients.  I will be using this cookbook a lot
Magic looks very nice on DVD. Solid clean picture quality with original basic mono soundtrack. A pleasant suprise from Dark Sky Films
it should be stateed this item is for 7 years and younger very small for older kid
I ordered this cable (two of them actually) to use on the LG 8300.  The driver disc contains software for the 8300 only not the 5300.  Once loaded, it found the phone easily.  I used bitpim (a free program you can find on the internet)to transfer data to the phone.   ---  --- The price of the cable was excellent.  I was unable to locate a data cable locally and was happy to find one on Amazon, even though it was only available through a third party.  All in all, I recommend the product to those in need of cables for the LG 8300.  For those wishing to use it on the LG 5300 please be aware there appears to be no driver included for your phone. --- 
I loved the concept of the markers. However they have left a greasy stain on my daughters clothing!! The package said that they didn't stain! I called and they gave me a long process to try and remove including Tide with Bleach..Is that one of their subsidiaries? I was very disappointed
I bought this hoping it would cure my busted Superdrive on my G4 iMac but when connected via the Firewire it would freeze any program I was using to burn cd's or dvd's.  I thought it might have been a messed up product so I returned it to Lacie and got another one but the problem still persisted.   ---  --- I then thought it was my computer, but the firewire ports worked when connected to my old iPod and even worked when connected to my Lacie external HDD.  Finally figured that the product was defective after I purchased the Sony DRX-830 dvd burner and that burner worked perfectly when connected via firewire.   ---  --- This product however worked when connected on the USB port but the burning speeds were so slow that it was just about useless
when I first got the package delivered to me at work, my assistant and I were smelling all the products... this one made both of us scrunch our noses in distaste. But when I got home and actually applied it to my hair, it smelled nothing like the nasty old lady smell I had detected before. The reason why I have given this product 5 stars, is because I feel that this conditioner has been unfairly graded here. The conditioner is for people with curly or processed hair -- meaning, if you have straight, thick hair, this conditioner may seem like a waste of money due to the amount of product you have to apply. Also, as us girls with curly hair know, not all curly hair is equal. Some have thick, springy curls that gets curlier the shorter the cut it, while others have a thinner quality to their hair which actually gets curlier the longer it gets. I'm the later, and I think this is why this product works for me. I can understand how this may seem misleading to those with the thicker curl types, but I'm here to set the record straight on that one. I hope it helps in deciding if this product is right for you
I loved this game as a child and I spent many hours playing it. I was incredibly excited to be able to play it on my Laptop. OOPS they didn;t update any of the drivers for the first two games (Kings Quest 1 & 2) so after about 15 minutes of playing you can't see the screen due to all of the graphic errors. There are no patches available as of yet and it dosn't look like any are on the way. I feel pretty ripped off. It says on the cover in big print. "Runs on Windows XP." Barely, and not very well when it does. If you are interested in this game check to see if Vivendi has done any patches before you buy it or you will be disapointed. Better yet download one of the fan-made editions for free online. They work
Pico-balla is a very subtle candy--and you will find yourself eating a large amount of it if you don't pay too much attention.  The different colors are each differently flavored, and you can eat this chewy treat slowly or quickly.  I like to bite off the outer layer first and then eat the inside, but my wife eats the inside part first.  Just a very different candy from what we are used to--it doesn't taste overly "sugary", won't feel like you are greasing your mouth with fructose, etc...give it a try.  I wish I had bought two boxes.  I wish Amazon offered the Balla-Balla, too.  I can't wait to try that sometime, but I would rather wait until I can get it at a good price.  Amazon's price is about 66% of the World Market price, and even less what online candy stores sell it for.  Take a chance on it. 
I've been a subscriber to Outside magazine for several years, and it seems to go through its ups and downs in terms of the strength of its editorial content, especially regarding the political side of environmentalism. It is still easily the most informative magazine out there for lovers of the outdoors, but just note that the focus is on active, not armchair, appreciation of nature. Beyond the occasionally great and always heavily knowledgeable product reviews, the key strength of this magazine is the well-written and strongly researched articles on outdoor issues of concern, not just in America but around the world. An outstanding recent example, among many, concerns the economics of environmentalism in the conservative Western U.S. This is the type of strong conservationist reporting that can usually only be found otherwise in books. Other more whimsical articles are just fun to read for those with off-kilter interests, such as recent pieces on urban rock climbing or sauna fanatics in Finland. ---  --- Many other articles could be classified more as travel/tourism than adventure, but the accompanying photography is always top-notch, and the editors have a knack for finding out-of-the-way hidden treasures around the world that are ripe for discovery by the adventurous. (But on the other hand, the magazine could be faulted for contributing to the recent trend of hyping previously unknown outdoor paradises that have since become crowded, such as Molly Sods Wilderness in West Virginia.)  Personally, I would like to see a little less focus on expensive vacations that extreme sports fanatics can take in hard-to-reach nations, and more on what folks with more realistic means (and amounts of free time) can do in humble parks and forests near home. But despite its habit of losing its focus at times, I will continue to be a fan of Outside for years to come, and might just travel to some of those hyped exotic adventure locations. [~doomsdayer520~
I've run my Panasonic KP-4A sharpener for nearly a decade, with nary a hitch. It chisels keen points quickly, with a little accompanying noise that wouldn't be disturbing in most situations. In fact, the pitch tells you when the sharpening is achieved. Seems unbreakable to me, as long as one does not force pencils downward--just hold them steady and in 5 seconds, the job's done. Its sleek, compact, cordless design works on any desktop
I read the label, and it is not a rare, tropical oil at all, but plain old American palm oil!  False advertising really bothers me.  It did condition my hair well, but I agree that the fragrances (which are added to it, by the way) make the odor very strong and unpleasant.  The price is also very high.  I will not order this again
I'm 15 and I have Star Wars: Battlefront 1 and 2, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 1 and 2, this game, and I'm getting LEGO Star Wars in the mail any day now.  I really like Star Wars: Battlefront 2 and Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 1, but this is a game that is hard to place as to how much I like it.  ---  --- I got this game 2 days ago after work at like 2 PM and I played it until like 1 AM and then I woke up the next day at about 9 AM and I beat it at maybe 1 PM.  So it took me about half a day to beat.  I was really mad when I beat it because I was having fun and it just suddenly ended.  And it was a really stupid ending too!   ---  --- The Good: --- - You have a really good control over your squad with a variety of different orders such as telling a squad mate to set up a sniping position in one spot or telling your slicer to slice open a door for you.  This is good so that you dont have to do everything yourself and you dont have to rely on your squad to give you covering fire when it takes a whole minute to slice into a computer data base. --- -The weapons are pretty sweet and they are ones that you have never really seen before (except for maybe thermal detonators or a wookie bowcaster.) --- -If you become incapacitated, you can tell your squad to come revive you, or if you don't feel like fighting, tell them to just maintain their current orders and revive you after the fighting is done. --- -The way to heal yourself is a bacta station, which I think is better than running over a health container. --- -The AI is good so your squad actually knows how to fight. ---  --- The Bad: --- -The game is a lot shorter than I expected with only about 3 different planets/ships --- -There are only about 5 different enemies: Battle droids, Super Battle droids, Trandoshans, Geonosians, and Magna Guards. --- -The enemies all act the same in every battle. --- -Super Battle droids are really annoying in a fight because they are really tough to beat if you just have a blaster rife (unless you're a noob and play it on easy.) --- -Telling your squad to do things gets repetative after a while. --- -The ending sucks. --- -Once you beat it, you can only play the game over on a harder setting, which is not really that fun, or play with your friends on multiplayers, which isn't fun either.  So you just put it back on the shelf for a while until you're bored and feel like playing it again. ---  --- So, all-in-all, this is a really fun game until you beat it.  So I suggest that you "pace" yourself.
My son has now 'graduated' to the regular tub but we used this tub for a year. It is perfect for when they are too big for the 'seats' and your tub doesn't accomdate the rings. In fact this is much better than a ring the babies sit in because there is pleanty to cusion them when they tumble over or slip trying to stand. Ours has withstood a year of use so far and we'll be using it with the next baby too
I had to return this product. I have a newer G5 iMac with all OS X updates and as a program it worked. But if you buying this for a sreensaver, like I did, the product didn't work. I tried emailing and posted a question on Allume forum, got no response.
This is the book that trackers and naturalists have needed for a long time.  It's finally here and it's outstanding!  Now when I take apart an owl pellet I'll be able to determine what the owl was eating, and hence what small wildlife is abundant in that area.  And when I'm out and discover part of a skull from a mammal, bird, amphibian, or reptile, I'll be able to find what that is too.  Mark Elbrock has done it again: an instant classic, and a book that all trackers and naturalists should have in their collection
I can't say I liked this CD.  Jessica Simpson was good when she started, but as her popularity has grown, her talents have declined.  She commited murder the day she recorded Senatra's song for "The Dukes of Hazard" movie
Not sure how I got it, but I got a browser hijacker that adaware and spybot wouldn't get rid of.  On top of that I got a trojan that these programs and my avast antivirus wouldn't get rid of.  So out of desperation to do something quickly, I went to B.Buy and bought this for $40.  They didn't have a large selection, so I put down the money for it.  Imagine my  feeling when I saw it on amazon for $20.  Still this product works well.  It made me uninstall spybot, adaware, and  turn off my windows firewall to install it.  You can install it on 3 different computers, or it asked you to switch your license from one of them, should you install it a fourth time.  So you can install it more than 3 times, you jsut have to switch your lisenses..understand?  Product works very well and got rid of my problems.  You get updates for 1 year, and then you have to renew.  I think this is stupid personally, but its the Trend now days.  Its a rip...you pay $40 for spyware or virus protection and it should be good for more than a year.  Several annoying windows pop up from time to time asking me what I want it to do.  I wish there was some default user setting so the program could do it.  The firewall slows down your connection, but they all do.  I have 3MG DSL and my speed test are down around 1300K, so I've lost alot of bandwith.  I guess its worth the protection.  Before with spybot and adaware, the spyscans would typically find 25+ issues of spyware.  Now with Trend Micro, I find only 5 to 10 issues on my weekely scan.  So I'm happy with the product, except for my decrease in DSL speed
I bought this for my son, who was just over 2 years old at the time.  Within about 9 or 10 months, the railing broke at the plastic hinge.  Obviously, since this is major stress point for the product, it cannot be fixed with just some heavy duty glue.  I was disappointed that this railing did not last longer
American Photo began as a magazine devoted more to photography than to gear, as an alternative to the gear obsessed magazines like Pop Photo and Photographic. It has evolved into a magazine that divides its pages between equipment obsession and cheesy "glamour" photography that tries for art and delivers soft core porn. No stars
IF YOU LIKE BEATLES, MONKEES AND THE WHO, THEN YOU WILL LIKE THE GROUP THAT IS BETTER THAN ALL OF THEM ; THE RASCALS ! "LONELY TOO LONG" IS A SAD ROCK POP PAINFUL STAPLE IN YOUR 60'S ELBOW...IT HURTS...THEN THERES ALL THIS OTHER GOOD SH*** HERE...AND I DON'T MEAN GROOVIN ! THE HARMONYS AND THE KILLER KEYBOARDS AND TIGHT DRUMMING IN THESE LITTLE POP ANGRY YET CHEERFUL NUGGETS IS WHERE ITS AT !...I CAN REMEMBER LISTENING TO THE RASCALS INTERMITENTLY WITH BLACK SABBATH AND THE STOOGES...AND I REALISED THAT ABOVE ALL...I LIKED MY RASCALS RECORD THE MOST BACK IN 1987 UP IN THAT COLD LONELY BEL AIR GARDENING CABODE !

Looking at the liner photos makes clear that Falkner is the prettiest thing this side of N Sync (and doesn't he know it, especially in the shot of him being served what appears to be a large dose of Johnnie Walker Black by a leggy Bunny Flight Attendant).  Which raises the question: is this the recond a boy band member would turn out if he got the idea he was an ARTIST?  Not to put too fine an edge on it, let's say bluntly that this is a vanity project by a middling talent.  Falkner does everything on the CD and my reaction is so what?  His voice is mediocre; his lyrics are banal ("Life can be just like a painting full of wonderful strangeness") or precious ("Suspended on this stage of grace I have to remember this sound"); the layers of sound he tracks down are just that -- layers of sound, with a disspiriting sameness song after song.  Give him two stars simply because he CAN do all the stuff on the record, but this guy needs to become a whole lot less full of himself and to spend a year or two listening to, say, Chrissie Hynde and John Hiatt CDs.  We'll let him come back then and try to write and play some adult love songs
Purchased a case of Bally Energy Drink since I seemed a bit sluggish after a 12 hour work day and kept making excuses NOT to work out. Gets me up and at em' and no more excuses for not going for a long walk or trip to the gym! Drank 1 can in the morning @ 5:30 am and another around 3pm. Give it a try
I bought this because it had got good reviews on here and the price was low enough for it not to pain me! So far it does what it's suppose to do.  I am pleased. It's a little clunky, and it looks awful when the anteni are fully extended. We'll see how it works in 6 months
I like a cup of coffee with character, and thus far this Black Gold Extra Bold has delivered.  The "Extra Bold" defines that this K-Cup carries an extra 20-30% of coffee per serving than the standard K-Cup, and as a result this delivers the extra kick that I tend to like.  We only brew at the 7.25oz, and sometimes the 5.25oz volume on our B-70 brewer as we prefer a stronger cup of joe.  This roast is on the dark side, and delivers flavor with intensity, and a nice smoky essence as described.  I also find that this provides a hint of crema, much like a shot of espresso when brewed fresh.  We like it, and if you like stronger coffee, we think you will too!  Try it
Warmth from window affects thermometer! D'oh! It's totally inaccurate on single-pane glazing, very inaccurate on dual-pane glazing, and still slightly inaccurate when mounted on a jerri-rigged 6" extender from dual-pane glass. The nature of windows being a big source of heat loss means this thermometer is measuring *warm* ambient air, not actual outside temperature
good price.  Just not sure it is needed
Why read a book from 1857 which flopped so badly as commercial literature that Melville stopped writing and ended his career as a customs official? Because this book masterfully explores the entire nature of trust, confidence and cons. Though the setting is a riverboat on the Mississippi River just before the U.S. exploded into Civil War, its insights cross cultural boundaries.  ---  --- This is not an easy book to read for several reasons. First, it is undoubtedly one of the first "post-modern" novels which breaks from traditional narrative storytelling. ( Another example: Dostoevsky's Notes From the Underground.) The Confidence-Man is a collection of 45 conversations between various people on the riverboat--beggars, absurdly dressed frontiersmen, sickly misers, shysters, patent medicine hucksters, veterans (of the Mexican-American War) and the "hero" in the latter part of the book, the Cosmopolitan.  ---  --- In typical Melville fashion, you also get asides--directly to the reader, in several cases, as if Melville felt the need to address issues of fiction outside the actual form of his novel. The lack of structure, action and conclusion make this a post-modern type book, but if you read each conversation as a separate story, then it starts to make more sense.  ---  --- For what ties the book together is not a story but a theme: the nature of trust and confidence. In a very sly way, Melville shows how a variety of cons are worked, as the absolutely distrustful are slowly but surely convinced to do exactly what they vowed not to do: buy the "herbal" patent medicine, buy shares in a bogus stock venture, or donate cash to a suspect "charity."  ---  --- In other chapters, it seems like the con artist is either stopped in his tracks or is conned himself. Since the book is mostly conversations, we are left to our own conclusions; there is no authorial voice wrapping up each chapter with a neatly stated ending. This elliptical structure conveys the ambiguous nature of trust; we don't want to be taken, but confidence is also necessary for any business to be transacted. To trust no one is to be entirely isolated.  ---  --- Melville also raises the question: is it always a bad thing to be conned? The sickly man seems to be improved by his purchase of the worthless herbal remedy, and the donor conned out of his cash for the bogus charity also seems to feel better about himself and life. The ornery frontiersman who's been conned by lazy helpers softens up enough to trust the smooth-talking employment agency owner. Is that a terrible thing, to trust despite a history of being burned?  ---  --- The ambuiguous nature of the bonds of trust is also explored. We think the Cosmopolitan is a con-man, but when he convinces a fellow passenger to part with a heavy sum, he returns it, just to prove a point. Is that a continuance of the con, or is he actually trustworthy?  ---  --- The book is also an exploration of a peculiarly American task: sorting out who to trust in a multicultural non-traditional society of highly diverse and highly mobile citizens. In a traditional society, things operate in rote ways; young people follow in their parents' traditional roles, money is made and lent according to unchanging standards, and faith/tradition guides transactions such as marriage and business along well-worn pathways.  ---  --- But in America, none of this structure is available. Even in Melville's day, America was a polyglot culture on the move; you had to decide who to trust based on their dress, manner and speech/pitch. The con, of course, works on precisely this necessity to rely on one's senses and rationality rather than a traditional network of trusted people and methods. So the con man dresses well and has a good story, and an answer for every doubt. ---  --- The second reason why Melville is hard to read is his long, leisurely, clause upon clause sentences. But the book is also peppered with his sly humor, which sneaks up on you... well, just like a good con.  ---  
I recently purchased an 8-pack of these batteries knowing that my Palm m100 would eat them up right away.  What a surprise!  I have had these batteries for over a month and they still have not been below 80%!  If that sounds too good, get this: these batteries lasted the whole entire band trip (under strenuous use) and the battery meter didn't even dip below 95%!  I would definetly recommend this product for people with Palm Pilots
Jodie Foster is excellent but there is no doubt that the daughter will be found on the plane at the end. The only mystery is in the details. No real suspense. I found the plot to be a little farfetched
Phaeton's son flew --- On wings of wax into sun --- Crashed and burned instea
The quality of the stones is horrendous, there are significant inclusions which are visible with naked eye from as far away as 3 feet. These diamons should have been turned into diamond dust, not set into jewelery
This airbed leaked slowly from day one. I sent it back and got an exact replacement that also had a slow leak from day one. I do not recommend this product.
Despite all the rave reviews I'm wondering if this is a dreaded rerecord. Maybe I'm paranoid, but the country music industry is so sleazy. And some stars feel entitled to cash in. How else can you explain the John Anderson Anthology...Horror.  (John, how could you?) Or the Bill Anderson Oh Boy Classic [Oh boy here comes a rerecord). Hey, the CD sounds great. But what makes me suspiscious is that there are no copyright dates anywhere on this CD except for one. Also the cryptic message on the inside sleeve.  Could someone please clear this up. And not some RCR Bud Logan shill either. John Conlee is one of my hero's and this is really worrying me. I can't look at this CD with Rose Colered Glasses anymore
I have received countless compliments on these rain boots. I love them, and I guarantee you will too! They are comfortable, stylish, and keep your feet dry in snow and rain. What a great purchase
The need for assassins is great - the evil keeps cranking up beyond belief as the suspense continues to buld.  What a book and what a series - more please
I have been searching for years for something to keep my lips from chapping, and this is it.  It's absolutely amazing, better than anything I have tried, and I have tried so many lip products.  The lemon custard flavor is delicious, too.  Put it on at night and in the morning your lips will be soft and smooth--This is the ultimate conditioner for your lips. 
This is a very good source of fiber with good taste and texture that even picky eaters enjoy
To echo another reviewer: --- I am a heavy runner with high (semi-flexible) arches and a neutral stride, running 20-35 miles per week. Even though my strides are consistent in terms of length, pronation,and heal-to-toe gait, I tend to have very heavy footfalls (being a former sprinter with muscular legs)and need a well-cushioned shoe. --- I am training for the Boston Marathon and have tried Asics Gel Kayanos (the shoe designed for the "clydesdale type" runner), a pair of Adidas Adistars (the newest model is a very good shoe but didn't fit my wider foot properly), and some various pairs of New Balance (least favorites of the bunch) but the Mizuno Wave 7's are by far the most natural feeling, durable, light-weight, cushioned (without being bulky) shoe I have ever owned. I have now owned two of the Wave Creation 7's and a pair of the older Wave Creation 6's and put a lot of miles on these shoes: they consistently hold up mile after mile better than any of the other shoes out there. The Gel Kayanos are the only shoe remotely comparable but I found that they break down far to fast for distance running (and they are slightly heavy). That and the Mizuno's were comfortable from the first step and did not require any breaking which is very rare. I am confident I could switch to a new pair a week before a marathon and hardly notice a difference.   ---  --- I would not only highly recommend this shoe to anyone with medium to heavy footfalls and a high arch but I endorse it as the only shoe I will buy as long as the line continues.
First impressions: It's a nice watch with a clear look. I was a little worried about the lack of backlighting, but was pleasantly suprised that I was able to see the luminescent dials clearly at any hour of the night. ---  --- Pros: Quick atomic time synchronization (usually within one to two minutes after the initial synchronization). Simple to use.  ---  --- Cons: Case is described as stainless steel, but back piece is plastic. Originally listed by Amazon as a solar-powered watch, but instead powered by regular battery. Battery life expectancy about 2 years, though it may lost longer by disabling the auto-sync feature. ---  --- Overall comments: This is my first atomic time wrist-watch. It automatically synchronizes with atomic time once at midnight (a function you can disable if desired) or on-demand with the press of a button or two. It does this by scanning for a radio signal. According to the instructions, you're supposed to leave this watch near a window with the 6-o'clock side facing the window for best radio-signal reception. Reception can of course vary depending on your location, but the watch has successfully updated several times even while I was wearing it. --- I like watches with flat crystal surfaces, because it allows me to paste a PDA screen-proctector (cut to size, of course) on them, which keeps the crystal from scratching. The crystal on this watch is only slightly curved, and in only one direction, meaning a screen protector sticks nicely and evenly to it. --- The watch is waterproof to 50 meters, which (in Casio terms) means you can go swimming with it, but you should not press any buttons underwater. I try to keep my watches away from water when I can, but it's always good to know that it should survive most water-related mishaps
Very good product and great kind of fruity smell. leave hair soft and full of "bounce". Easy to comb hair after using this product but might be combine with Kerastase conditionner for very dry and damage hair if your hair are very long. The price here is still more expensive than in Europe: around 22 euros
My husband and I like the Newman O's better than Oreo's, and our 3 year old son loves them! As we did as a child, he pulls the cookies apart and eats the cream filling, just like an oreo. Also, the Newman O's do not have the harmful high fructose corn syrup that oreos still have
Getting the family to watch any of these is like pulling eye teeth...and they were all for buying it
I think if Charles Bukowski, Dylan Thomas, and Fellini collaborated on a piece of writing, it's possible they would have come up with this screenplay. This movie is exciting because it's soooo different from anything I've ever seen. Deliciously non-linear. The substance abuse aspect is a little overdone but that's the destiny of "artist movies". I loved hearing the dialog, and Kristofferson's acting is the best I've ever seen by him. Anything so daring and so unconventional will naturally upset some people (like other reviewers here), but if you ask me that only validates the work. If ever I go to New York City, the Hotel Chelsea will be at the top of my list of places to visit. My favorite lines were by the crazy guy in the elevator, who after claiming to have had a conversation with Dylan Thomas said that ghosts naturally reside in places like the Chelsea because people will listen to them there. The DVD extras contain a couple of quirky interviews, one with director Ethan Hawke and the other with Robert Sean Leonard who plays a deeply troubled folksinger in the film
I love these little books... they play music.. good for before bed, my girls can chew on them (which makes both me and my two year old son happy)... --- Just fantastic... great buy
I ordered the unit twice, and twice I received a Carrying Case. not the adapter.  I returned both and ordered direct from Cobra.   --- When I had called customer support for Amazon the second time, I got connected to India of course and was informed that a lot of their codes are wrong.  I guess they are trained to agree with anything the customer says.
I bought my 8525 when they first came out, like two months ago right after christmas --- I upgraded to a 2gig memory card and also have the GPS service --- I love my phone though it might have problems time to time and some getting used to --- Overall this was the best purchase for the price, I ended up spending  almost $900 --- but I also had the bluetooth essential pack the GPS and some other features ---  --- This is the best phone out. period. --- no the iPhone isn't going to beat it --- the iPhone doesn't have a slide out keyboard --- that's soemthing I don't want to part with --- I would like to see the iPhones operating system though! --- but the 8525 takes home the trophy!!!
How good is Angelina Jolie in this film? It is a testament to this young actor's presence that even as dark and soul sickened and gloriously decaying as her character is, there is not a frame in this film that doesn't feel her infection. ---  --- Winona Rider is equally excellent as the psychologically confused (or is it enlightened?) hero forced to navigate the depths of her own psyche. The interplay between these two is somehow able to range from the enchanting to the exquisitely painful; but from beginning to end remains capable of leaving you breathless. One look into Angelina Jolie's eyes and you will see the warm, jaundiced decay of a soul no longer battling with sanity. Fear is born of those eyes when you realize how strongly they've tempted your own tired efforts...even as the second look delves closer to a bleakness bearing fruition beyond existential suicide.  ---  --- Presented with the softly rendered and absorbing visualization of a young girl's decent into psychological insecurity; it is a hauntingly supple progression toward the half understood disturbance of what we might have experienced. James Mangold directed this film quite nicely from a very good screenplay; he managed to portray all these young women as young women in turmoil. No melodrama, no over the top sentimentality, just a frank peek into their tumultuous lives. ---  ---   --- If you've ever questioned your own sanity or escaped periods of exceptional melancholy in your life, this film is certain to trigger old fears. But it is also certain to remind you how exquisite and simple salvation can often be. This film deserves that second look, as well as its painful salvation: a jaundiced beauty whose tragic death is no less healing than the memory of a lost friend. It is a heavy drama, so be forewarned! And a very moving drama at that.
The card works and produces a reasonable image, but the "Catalyst" software used to drive the card is lacking/buggy.  To make work, I had to disable the SCSI CD burner in the system (or the software would hang for several minutes before working).  The sofware is slow to open/respond, beyond that the ability to size the TV window is very limited.  This card replaced a standard TV card in my system that I bought for $25.  I used the old card more because it would open quickly and I could resize the window to be small (non intrusive) while I was working on other things.  On the plus size, I can expand the HDTV card to larger windows while retaining a good image
I love this product.  Its the first one I've found where I can practically have wash and go curly hair.  Just put work it through damp hair and let it air dry or twist around fingers for defined curls
This tools is really really great. It helped me to overcome the problem I faced while playing guitar, specially the barre chords
I purchased this pedometer to replace one that kept resetting itself back to zero ... the case cover on this one protects the buttons so it doesn't reset. I like the fact that I can open the lid and read the LED without taking it off. My only problem is the little leash ... it came with both a plastic and a metal clip.  The plastic clip has lost it's "springiness" and I'm sure will stop working soon; but at least I have the metal clip to fall back on
Though I've odered many times with Amazon, this is the first time I have been excited enough to review a product!  I'm an adult who wants to learn guitar for fun and didn't want to play "Mary had a little lamb" and scales for months.  I have only used the software for about an hour, and have already been playing parts of songs I actually like!  I have been playing guitar for a total of one week prior to receiving this (without any instruction).This is perfect if you don't have the patience or desire to learn the traditional way.  I wish I had this when I was 14, I would have loved it. ---  --- I can't vouch for the whole thing yet, since I've only played with it for an hour, so I give it 4 stars instead of five.  From what I've seen I have no reason to expect that it will let me down and highly recommend it
The seams on the pillow are sharp and uncomfortable.  The extra pouches that supposedly provide additional support don't measure up.  THe snaps that should hold the ends together don't work.  Basically, it would be OK if it came with a soft cover
He loved it! He's 14. He likes to draw what he sees while traveling, and this is a freat way to take his sketch materials with him
Firstly, I have not seen the film adaptation of 'Single White Female' and so this review isn't tainted one way or the other.  This book, about the stolen identity of a young woman by her psychotic flatmate, is written is very easy style.  Characterizations, prose, and dialogue are all straightforward.  I can understand why a film was made based on it since the book reads more like a screenplay than a novel.  And the book's "feel" is anything but original.  'Sliver' by Ira Levin does a better job of capturing the essence of life (and danger) in Manhattan for a single, white female.  Still, 'Single White Female' is an entertaining read. ---  ---  --- Bottom line: a very enjoyable, suspenseful read that doesn't tax the brain.  Recommended
I have yet to read this book, however, so far the ***** average rating is quite suspicious...  Each one of the three *****-reviewers, does not have a single other review in their profile.  I am at the stage where I am trying to learn as much as possible about spreads' trading, so I would greatly appreciate if someone who actually has real-life experience trading futures spreads and who has also read this book, to do everyone of the rest of us a favor, and post an honest review - please, we need a counterbalance to the nonsense posted by those who are most likely associated w/ the author or his publisher..
The title says it all: one month the warranty expired, the zoom feature on the camera broke, making a horrible grinding noise if you attempted to turn it on.  The camera is all but useless.  The Fuji shop said they need to replace the lens assembly, at a cost of at least US$120; for that price, I'm buying a new camera, but not another F10. --- 
unlike most tech gadgets that are a little outdated, this product stands in nearly every aspect. The sleek, supreme design by F.A. Porsche makes this product appearance timeless, and its preformance is outstanding, more effective in this model than its smaller, slower (80Gb, 120 Gb) counterparts. The autostart is a little slow for me (its the USB model, not firewire, remeber), but is a totally acceptable feature for the price, design & performance cost-benefit equilibrium. Excellent purchase
seems I may have already broke this bar - twisted it to stop it from spinning while I was doing exercise and heard a POP now it spins all the time I use it - Not happy :(  I did not force it a suprised such a sturdy looking piece would break already
     I was surprised at how good this worked with very little uncomfortableness while sleeping.  It didnt take much pressure on the toes --- to be able to get up in the morning with very little pain on my heal.  Had problems for the last 4 months before the Thermoskin.  Have been using it 2 weeks now and am already trying to slowly get back to running. --- Great product
I received a pleasent surprise. The keyboard was shipped sooner than I expected, arrived in perfect condition and works beautifully. I will buy from this vendor again
As a brilliant, but ruthless leader of the Piraka, Zaktan thinks that working together is the way to find the ultimate treasure, the mask of life! All the Piraka have two tools. Yes, 2. Each one has a Zamor spheres which are small marbles that each one can shoot, but in real life they would be the size of basketballs. Zaktan's three-pronged blade is capable of cutting through metal. Nothing will get in his way, or it will be severely punished................
Fatally flawed.  Magnificently compact, clever design, but broke first time I used it--el-cheapo plastic clamps snapped.  Service center wouldn't repair it, so I had to return it.  An otherwise beautiful design, with a frustrating Achilles heel.  AARRGH!
My 6 year old loves this book.  Wanting to be like her sister she is learning spanish too!  This is a very well laid out book.  enhances the ability for young children to learn a second language
Peculiar unpleasant taste with an unnatural texture. After trying one package. It was so bad that I had to throw out the rest of the case. A waste of money
Actually, it's a fabulous watch.  It looks great, does everything that you would expect, and is a joy to look at - I've swapped it for a watch that my wife bought me for a wedding present "just to get used to it for a bit" (which obviously she's less than pleased about), and everytime I look at it I see a really great watch that I'm really pleased I bought. ---  --- HOWEVER, if there was a design fault, it would be this: when you start and then stop the stop watch, you cannot reset without pressing and holding the reset button; surely it would be better for a one-touch reset?  Also, with the Timer - loop 3 (which is continuous countdown) the reset button (again press and hold) resets the timer to zero (as you would expect the 'set' button to do), and the set button (press and hold) resets the timer to the original timer setting (eg 5 mins) - surely these are the wrong way round?  All a bit odd, but sort-of OK once you get used to it.  Seems a bit sloppy though in its design. ---  --- Nonetheless, overall an excellent watch.  I'm really please I bought it and it's very useful for triathlon events, using the lap on the stopwatch
This Games Story Takes Place Before GTA 3 So It's Sort Of Like A Prequal Set In Liberty City Compared To The Original It Looks A Lot Better Plus They Added Bikes And Motor Cycles And Attempted To Improve The Targeting By Using The Targeting System From San Andreas I Hate The Targeting But Being Able Target Manually Is A Good Thing If You Don't Own A Psp I'd Suggest Getting This Game But If You Do And Played It On That System There Really Isn't Any Point To Buying This Game Unless You Really Really Love GTA
I loved the CD, it took me back to the days of the original recordings, however the sound was not as good as the original.  
...but this album should never have been released as the "final" Queen-album. A couple of these songs should instead have been added as bonus tracks to one of those many Best of Queen-releases. "A Winters' Tale" for example. Do I know much about the background for "Made in Heaven", well perhaps not. But I know that this is known to be the last studio release. Sadly it has the sound of elevator-music all over, not that the melodies are bad, it just sounds... almost cheap actually -and most importantly to my ears (at least) this doesn't sound like my Queen. One of the most important bands in the history of music saying good-bye with "Made in heaven"? Was this really Freddie Mercurys' wish? It doesn't make much sence after the fantastic "Innuendo" released in short time before his tragic death containing the haunting ballad "These are the days of our lives". The words and the music... wow! And the music video to this song, have you seen it? To me that was the real good-bye with Freddie, and with Queen. And it has the sound of how I will remember them. ---  --- But is "Made in Heaven" really that bad? Yes, and no. "Heaven for everyone" by Roger Taylor made it sound promising, and don't forget; I was exited when I heard about "a final material"-release. But it turned out, as you might have guessed, far from what I had expected. Old songs from B-sides and solo-albums are mainly fillers for this album... I mean honestly? "Too much love..." then quite a resent hit from Brian Mays' solo-album "Back to the light", I remember thinking "What's the point?" And it actually sounds better from his solo-album without the synth dominating the song here. Don't get me wrong now, Freddies' vocal is as good as you'd expect, it's what they've made out it that surprises me. And what makes me wish they hadn't. At least not for an entire album.  ---  --- "A winters' tale" is a positive surprise though. Perhaps not Freddies' best song, and not better than "These are the days...". But it's a celebration of the beauty in life. At least it sounds like that to me. Freddie captures a moment of harmony and peace. And beauty. And it sounds like a classic Queen-song! "A beautiful day (intro and reprise)" functions well too. But what tracks 12 and 13 are about I have absolutely no idea..? I wish they would have ended the album with Freddies' last "Yeah!" on the song. I wish... ---  --- So all in all; "Innuendo" remains the explosive good-bye with the "real" Queen. At least it does to me. ---  --- (Let me add that the cover of "Made in Heaven" is perfect for the title, and somehow amazingly "seals" in its' simplicity the fate of the band with Freddie in the lead. The three band members left (Brian, Roger, John) facing the sunset, and a statue capturing Freddie in a remembarable style on stage. Reminding me of him at Wembley 86. To me this actually expresses something beyond words, and it's impossible not to get a bit of an empty feeling watching it while listening to "Heaven for everyone" or "A winters' tale".)    
The stores near my house charge over $2 a box for the organic type. Half of me thinks it's great to have it avail on demand through Amazon for cheaper - the other half is ashamed to waste the fossil fuel on a special trip to my house. ---  --- I think Annie's should be able to make their product a little cheaper by now - it's pretty dang popular. Oh Well, the Alfredo variety isn't avail thru Amazon right now anyway, so I'm stuck (again) watching for sales and stocking up - which makes the formerly-ashamed half of me happy
This program is good if you want to mold the matrix bit by bit. But if you want to make games in a snap, spring for the professional and get a level editor on a DarkBASIC website
Great buy for the money. four stars only because it is made out of about 3/8" mdf and could be sterdier. Height is great for medium size bookshelf speaker tweaters to be at ear level while siting on the couch
I recently purchased the GoFit 40lb weighted vest, and it's everything I hoped it would be. I was looking to add weight to my speed walking workouts, and this vest has proved to be a good choice. The weight is balanced well between front and back of my body. The shoulder straps are comfortable and have given me no problems in hourlong walks. The velcro straps are adjustable to fit all but the largest of waists to insure a snug fit and no movement. I have even used the vest when working in the yard and weight lifting, though it does hamper some bending movements. The weights can be taken out if you need to make it lighter. I am well pleased with my purchase
This visor is square in shape instead of oval, I have never seen a square visor before. It looks very strange.  Also, it is not comfortable as it is supposed to be, it is uncomfortable at the location where the sides hug to my head.  I will not be wearing mine
I got this puzzle for my three children (age 5, 4, and 2) and within a day my 2 year old had chewed off enough of the little black rubber pieces that the toy no longer worked.  It requires two of them for the vehicles to make sounds, so removing one means it doesn't work.  The pieces are small enough that I wasn't very worried about choking, but why buy a toy which makes you worry?  We were really disappointed.  
Just get them! We absolutely love this snack! The flavor is unique and refreshing. We even hide the bags from eachother so we get our own stash! The other flavors are good too, but this is Sahale shinning STAR! Thanks for such an "out of the box" snack!
This was my dad's absolute favorite candy. He loved orange and bittersweet chocolate best of any flavors and this was, for him a match made in heaven. I adore it as well. After my dad passed away, I found a stash of them in his cupboard. They aren't easy to find, but they make a most welcome after-dinner sweet with coffee for guests.
This stuff is wonderful!  I still use a moisturizer w/ SPF 15, but why settle for SPF 15 when you can get SPF 40?  This is not a creamy sunscreen that makes your skin feel all oily and like it can't breathe, instead it's more on the liquid side and you just quickly rub it in, then you can go ahead and put your regular moisturizer and makeup over it.  It's lovely and light and you can wear it every day.  It's the only sunscreen I have found that has enough SPF coverage for my sensitive pale skin but isn't thick enough to clog up my pores and cause breakouts. It may seem expensive, but not only is the quality of the product worth it, but you only need a small amount.  I wear it during the spring and the summer, and after a year I'm still working on the same bottle.  I wasn't sure if it was going to be effective (not being from a brand that you usually associate with rugged outdoor activity), but after a week by the beach, I was the only one who's face wasn't burned all red, even though everyone else had been wearing Coppertone and Bullfrog facial sunscreen
With 20 grandkids and 3 great grandkids, I have spent many hours with them playing games on the comptuer.  Almost all of them like all types of games, but the I Spy Series is one of the most played series that I have.  The I SPY TREASURE HUNT notes ages 6 to 10 and they must have done a lot of testing to be able to devlop a game that is actually challenging and interesting for adults,  and yet can actually be played by young kids as well.  The I Spy series has always had very hight quality games, and this is at the top of the list for me.  I will warn you though, that if you play with your kids, be prepaired to surprised. My usual play is for me to help the kids search, and not find items and tell them, but if they get stuck, point out an area to look at.  With this one, I have a seven year old that was finishing finding the last 4 or five items before I could find even one of them.  Great play for everyone.  Super recommended
Im not sure about the other products out there but this stuff will make you believe your at the theater...the only problem is with the application..there are no instructions and its really thick so i have found the only way is to pour some into a small container (i used an old mustard squirt container) then spread cooked popcorn all level in the maker then apply some liberally on top then mix it all together...after doing that twice the popcorn is perfect the only problem is that itmakes the popcorn maker ALLOT messier then if you applied it somewhere else...good luc
I had the exact same experience as "Heather" shown below. They sent me the less expensive NON-ORGANIC version of this product TWICE and then  informed me that they couldn't guarantee when the problem would be fixed.  ---  --- Remember that strawberries and cherries are on every list for crops containing the most pesticide. Now add that freeze dried snacks are  concentrated. Finally, take these concentrated levels and place them in a small child or toddler's body and their pesticide exosure goes through the roof. Do the math.  ---  --- Note to Amazon: This is a great product with fruit "and nothing else" in its ingredients. Please retain it and get it right to benefit the scores of us that enjoy providing healthy treats for our kids.
I loved the artistic topics of Art & Music in this particular Little People DVD.  And I have to say, this is one of our favorites.  But I do agree with the other reviewer about the duplicate episodes showing up in each DVD.  If you have other LP movies, then you will feel slightly dissapointed to see the episodes repeating themselves here and there.  I also agree that the menu setup could be better, with all 10 episodes playing back-to-back, rather than split into 5 at a time the way they currently are.  Otherwise, this is still a great DVD - much better than the LP Storytime Collection
This thing is great. Our 4 year old loves it.  The working drawbridge, breakaway wall for cannon fire and trap door are great.  Considering the size and number of pieces, it was remarkably easy to put together.  Allow 2 to 3 hours for assembly, but the directions are excellent.  Only complaint is that some of the small pieces that don't always want to stay together - some of the "details" will likely be missing after a few weeks.  Overall, very happy with it
The movie had potential: good cast and interesting plot.  Its the kind of movie you want to like, but just can't.  I did not find it all that funny or romanic.  It seemed that the mother and a bride's maid were suppose to be funny characters but I found neither very amusing.  I have no idea why the two main characters fell in love with each other; this is by far the biggest weakness of the movie.  Their relationship is not developed well at all.  As another reviewer noticed, there is a bit of Pretty Woman here, as Dermot plays a male escort.  For whatever reason, Julia Roberts as a hooker is cute, whereas Dermot is not.  I found is pretty disgusting that Messing falls for a male prostitute.  There is a lot of crude sexual humor that I didn't care for.  My favorite aspect of the movie was that most of it takes place in the English countryside, which is really beautiful.  Its not a terrible movie, but I would be upset if I paid $10 to see it in the theater
I expected so much more from this movie, I guess since the cast included two of my favorite actors (Jolie & Washington) and also had the always on point Queen Latifah as well.  I watched with full expectation to absolutely love this movie, but I walked away bitter with shattered expectations.  First off I will say that Latifah was wonderful here and she proved as the only reason I smiled on occasion during this movie experience.  Washington and Jolie on the other hand were so unbelievable (especially Washington who really strained in this role) that I was constantly asking myself "do I really like these two?" and I had to remind myself of movies like 'Gia' and 'Training Day' to answer with a resounding "YES!" ---  --- The film follows a rookie cop (Jolie) as she helps a quadriplegic ex-cop Lincoln (Washington) track down a serial killer mimicking the killings detailed in a book called 'The Bone Collector'.  The ending is really annoying since the revelation of the killer, while not who you'd pinpoint, is not of any significance and so it manages to stir up absolutely no emotion whatsoever.  It's like "oh so he/she did it...interesting"...and I'm bored.  I'd skip this one for it becomes generic within the first five minutes and stays that way until the credits finish rolling
 I have used the unit for about two weeks, with NiMH rechargable batteries installed, and it performs as advertised. There is, in my opinion, a design flaw: the Start/Stop button acts as the power on{off function, and is easily depressed at unwanted times, e.g. putting into or removing from the case.  They could/should have included an AC adapter
This movie shows the real life hell that was Andersonville.  A prison camp that turned into a death camp. Not enough food,water or shelter for all the prisoners sent there. The south was losing the war so they had no provisions or men to assist in the detainment of these captured soldiers. Basically letting them rot slowly inside the walls that confinded them. A well acted movie which shows the hell that can come from wa
I own both the original unbreakable autolock (with the flat key) and the autolock pro (with the round key). The original autolock never failed to open after 10+ years of use on two cars. The autolock pro failed to open after about two years of light use. This is not a key problem, because I could not open it with two original keys. I eventually wiggled the lock a lot to open it. I recommend that you stick with the original autolock if you wish to use this kind of security device
Received as a gift from my wife (I'm the cook) and it makes quick work of herbs, fresh berries for yogurt or anything you need to smash
It' curious how an interesting history can be not well told by a modern music. In some cases the music go to the hand with the story, but not in this CD, in which we say the music that it is not for the story. I didn't ejoyed with that C
My objection was the implication that the "stars" played a part in the film.  I felt that the picture was completely deceptive. Ms Richards and Ms Hanna had less than 15 minutes (maybe a little more but not much and possible even less) and were clearly there to fool the viewer.  It was an interesting documentary about prostitution and it might have been an interesting and revealing film if the the stars had been left out and it was done only as a documentary
I own many Sony products, including a Sony Cybershot DSC-F717, which I love. However, I am very disappointed by this camera, the Sony Cybershot DSC-T5. ---  --- I bought the T5 for my mother and father as a present. It is small, lightweight, portable; easy to use; and stylish. It does take nice photos in brightly lit environments, especially outside. ---  --- However, after several months of use, a few problems have become consistently evident:  --- (1) There is HORRIBLE red-eye (and white-eye) artifact in MANY pictures. The so-called "red-eye reduction" setting does nothing. --- (2) Dim-light photography is very grainy, with lots of noise. Night-time photography is impossible. ---  --- These problems are not unique to our camera... You will find many corroborating reviews above. ---  --- Overall, I am VERY disappointed in this camera, and wish I could exchange it for something else. ---  --- Do not buy this camera. Other reviewers suggest the T7 or T9 take much better pictures (and they are still small pocket-size cameras). --- 
Nice good looking grill, good price with free shipping. --- 4 stars for minor bends from shipment. Arrived two days earlier than scheduled. Clear instructions, you can put it together in less than an hour. --- Cooks nice, cleans easy. --- Recomended
A great program. Pretty easy to use. You have to play around with it to learn all the things it will do. I bought it usedfrom a list on Amazon and it was fine. Really like the program. Linda J Johnso
I love this car seat except for the fact that the one I have is defective.  The crotch snap does not work properly.  When I contacted Baby Trend, they advised that they do not exchange or repair their products free, even though mine was manufactured in October 2006 & I contacted them in December - less than a month after I bought it. ---  --- Otherwise, this is a wonderful seat.  I love the triangular handle.  I use it with the Snap & Go and have no trouble at all transferring her.  If she falls asleep in it, it is easy to take her wherever I want without disturbing her.  She seems very comfortable in it as well.  She was born November 12, 2006. ---  --- The hood is such that it can block out the sun, no matter from which direction it is shining.  And you can still see her face - if you are tall enough. ---  --- The product is great - if yours if fully functioning.  I'm anxious for her to grow to 20 pounds so I can buy another seat.  As it is, I try not to take her in the car any more than I have to because of the defective lock since I can't spring for another seat now.  I will never buy another Baby Trend for that reason
I got the WaterPik JP-130 to replace a shower head that was set too low for my husband.  Installation was easy enough, though, we had to purchase plumber's white tape to get a good seal.  Other showerheads I've purchased have come with the tape included which is why I took off one star.  The arm was long enough that my husband can step under it and still have clearance from the wall.  It creates a soft fall of water that I really enjoy and the head is large enough that I am actually able to wash my hair more quickly as it hits more of my hair at one tim.  I've not had any problems with the thumb screws and I have been move the unit quite often so that I can shave my legs.  I've loved this product so far and would definitely purchase again. 
I bought this shoe and had to return it because it was so narrow I couldn't get it on and I don't have a narrow foot
The IS-DV only records videos in the 'ASF' format, not MPEG-4.  I bought one from 'egghead.com'.  After 30 days, I contacted Aiptek to tell them the problem, they acknowledged that the IS-DV only records videos in the 'ASF' format.  They said there is nothing they will do about it.  Do not buy this product.  Aiptek advertises that the IS-DV records video in MPEG-4 format, but it doesn't.  'Egghead.com' won't deal with me because they say I should deal with the manufacture after 30 days from the purchase date
Put simply, this toy doesn't work. Or I should say perhaps it would work with really good bubble solution but it does not work with the bubble solution that comes with it. It sort of sputtered some bubble solution out the top but we never got even one full bubble much less the stream of bubbles we were hoping for. Luckily my little son never saw the toy and therefore didn't mind when we took it back
a lot of people seem to snub their noses at Let's Talk About Love because it wasn't the career-defining album as the album that preceded it, but all in all, it's still a fantastic snapshot for Celine's career in 1997. ---  --- Celine shocked almost everyone by releasing a follow-up so shortly (Falling Into You was still in the top 40 on the charts at the time) but it was very worthy. ---  --- Among my faves on the album include "The Reason", "Immortality" with The Bee Gees (for a "Celine-less" version of the song, check out The Bee Gees' 2-disc hits collection from 2001), "Love Is On The Way", the very funky "Treat Her Like A Lady", "To Love You More" and the beautiful singalong title track.   This album also housed "My Heart Will Go On" which certainly helped push this album to sales over 9 million.   While it was a song that you wanted to smash the stereo at the time because it was being played every five minutes, I'd say enough time has passed that once again you can enjoy and appreciate this beautiful, powerful ballad. ---  --- With "Falling Into You" and this album, Celine was the #1 female artist for a period, becoming a superstar right as Mariah was abandoning AC for r&b, as Alanis was going on hiatus for awhile, and when Shania was taking off but hadn't yet exploded into major-superstardom.  Love her or malign her (it seems fashionable to do the latter), she became one of the premier voices in Adult Contemporary and won over a large audience.  I haven't been a fan at all of her last few albums, but if she ever comes back with an album like these two, I'd snatch it up in a heartbeat
I LOVE BRITNEY so i went against the bad reviews! --- MAN WAS I WRONG it is sooooo bad!! --- its the worst dvd in history
Pretty pendant for the price.  The chain is very light but the pendant itself is nice and hangs well
Love Bob"s Red Mill Organic Golden Flaxseed, and will purchuse it again, it is one of the best product on the market, in my opinion. --- I use Flaxseed every day, I start my morning with a Oatmeal flax seed muffen that I came up with, I also use it in a lot of my recipies, Good Product, Thanks Bob's Red Mill
Halfway through it and it is very good concerning the difficulties that physicians who are married or in a serious relationships face thoughout their careers.  A good read for those entering the profession and a must read for those recently married
This a very basic smoker.  It is well built.  Easy to assemble w/ good instructions.  Not much information on the actual smoking process but the internet is full of information.  --- No information on how to adjust the vent to make it run cooler or hotter.  Do not think it should matter w/ gas.  It might just regulate the amount of smoke.  I leave mine 1/2 open. ---  --- Runs to hot for a smoker when set as the instructions recommended, gas valve 1.5 turns open.  I have mine less than 1/3 of a turn open to achieve 225deg. It took some trial and error to figure out how to get the temp low but once you figure it out the gas smoker works great. ---  --- Would have been 5 stars if knob on the smoker was able to adjust the temp low enough.  I keep mine pegged on low
    After doing some research and owning a cheaper shredder model,  I decided to purchase this shredder.  So far it was a wise decision.  I have seen it elsewhere for a lot more money.  I have been using it to shred up all my old and new personal documents and it is awesome.  I put a kitchen garbage bag in the can and it keeps all the little paper pieces contained within the bag, and I can just keep reusing the same bag. It really is a smooth shredder and it keeps on working, no jams, etc.  Great Buy!
There is actually science to support this serum, and per a D Magazine article, several female dermatologists use it on their own skin.  You spread a few drops on your face (and I use it on my neck and back of my hands as well) in the morning before sunscreen or makeup.  It does not irritate my sensitive skin (I have rosacea and seb derm) or clog my pores.  A lot of expensive products are just hype, but I think the science and the fact that so many dermatologists use it make this one worth the money. 
this bin is great for cloth diapers. we love ours. keeps odors to a minimum and holds a day or two's worth of diapers-- which is all i need because we wash every other day. Our local Babies R Us sells replacement deodisks (or you can buy them online from cloth diaper vendors) when the one that comes with it loses it's smell so that you can maintain freshness. It's easy to clean and use and pretty inexpensive
After I saw the first two "Scary Movies" I decided too see this movie. I thought the Wayans brothers were the two writers, but I can see that I was wrong. This movie is a spoof with no plot and no good jokes. I could hardly understand anything in this movie at all without giving my self a headache! I myself, a teen, which this movie appealed too did not find this funny. I don't know why teens like this movie so much.  --- -Ben Russell
If you're looking for a slim cover that won't add a lot of bulk to your RAZR, this one is great. No, it probably WON'T provide much protection if you drop your phone. It DOES protect your RAZR from scratches and fingerprints, and the rubberized material is easy to grip and feels great in your hand. The cutouts for the outside display, camera (I have a V3m), and M logo are perfectly placed and the whole cover fits well. I don't use the belt clip, as the cover by itself adds hardly any bulk so I just keep my phone in my pocket. Without the belt clip, there is a small 'snap' that sticks out a bit from the back of the cover but it's really no big deal. For the $3, you can't beat this. :-
Good for those looking for a vector collection.  Not so good for those looking for photo clip art, as photos are "high-res" at 200 DPI.  I suppose the photos are useful to an extent, but the usefulness is limited by size.  I was looking for vector art, so I am satisfied
These used to be the best sardines before Bumble Bee bought King Oscar. 16-24 delectable Brisling sardines in excellent Olive Oil. Couldn't find better. Now, instead of the advertised small 16-24 Brislings, you will find 8-11 large bony and un-appetizing sardines. Crap
If there is one thing Michael Bay is good at, it's explosions.... big 'ol explosions. There are a lot of them in this film, along with a painful-to-watch romantic scene involving animal crackers.  ---  --- This is a film that Ben Affleck & Billy Bob Thornton (both in the film) admit to being ashamed of. ---  --- Pure "leave your brain at the door" entertainment. --- 
Arrived timely, a bit smaller than I had envisioned but beautiful and comfortable to wear
The magazine provides its readers with immediate access to startling developments in science, technology and medicine with a renewed emphasis on how those breakthroughs affect their world. The world is evolving faster than ever. New technologies are influencing every aspect of our lives. An award-winning, general interest magazine devoted to the world of science and technology.For three out of my four years in high school, I kept up with Discover. It allowed me to be geeky without overstressing my brain on very technical, field-specific jargon that I'd find in journals like Scientific American. I learned a lot from that magazine. I learned such and such, and my best guess is from Discover. I usually don't retain fine details, but the pull quotes and headlines from that magazine stick with me.Discover is my science magazine of choice. Look for subscription deals and you'll be a happy geek like me, too.  --- 
The footbed on these clogs is very comfortable, but buyer beware - the buckles are attached with staples through the suede and come undone very easily (in my case, after two wearings) The seller's return policy is such that once the shoes have been worn outside, they won't take them back.  I had to sew the buckles back on.  In my opinion, $100 shoes shouldn't need to be repaired after two wearings.   ---  --- The suede is also much darker than the picture - still a pleasant color, but not what I expected when I ordered
I ordered the Smack and Yack:Disney Cars Sally, Lightning and Ramone for Christmas.  The only one of them that worked consistently after a few minutes was Ramone.  Sally and Lightning only worked sporadically after a few minutes and then after about an hour,  they wouldn't work at all.  I ended up having to order the same ones again because my daughter was so upset that they stopped working on Christmas.  I hope the new ones work for a longer time than the orginal purchases
I'm in love with The Impressionists in general and with Auguste Renoir in particular. ---  His palette is full of light; soft pink, greens and blues are a joy to watch time and again. As most Impressionists Renoir paint wonderful every day scenes, mainly outside as his magnificent: "The Luncheon of the Boating Party" (1881), "The Swing" (1876) and "Le Moulin de la Galette" (1876), whose careful reproductions are shown here. ---  He was an artist that loved life and wanted to reflect it as he perceived: full of little moments of simple joy and relax. ---  He was also a masterful portrayer as you may see from his "On the Terrace" (1881) in the cover of this book or "Two Girls in Black" (1881).  ---  Another subject that attracted his fancy was the dancing couple, which he depicts with tenderness and accuracy. It doesn't matter if the dancers are from the high class as in "City Dance" or commoners as in "Dance at Bougival" both from 1883. ---  At the end of his life his paintings evolve and produce for our delight: "Seated Bather" (1914) and "The Nymphs" (1918). ---  His life and works are described and commented by the author with keen penetration and endearment. ---  Reproductions are awesome and do justice to the Artist. ---  Do not miss this book!  ---  Reviewed by Max Yofre. ---   --- 
Flax is a plant. The seeds in the flax plant are filled with flaxseed oil, (sometimes called linseed oil). The seeds contain fatty oils called alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) and linoleic acid. ALA is the omega-3 oil in flaxseed. Flaxseed contains both omega-3 fatty acids and omega-6 fatty acids. Flaxseed is nature's richest storehouse of omega-3 fatty acids, and contains more than twice as much omega-3 oil as fish oils, and it costs less , ounce for ounce. Flax also contains other important substances like lignans, which may protect against some types of cancer. The husks of the seeds are rich in mucilage. Both the seed oil and mucilage have many nutritional and therapeutic properties.  ---  --- There are many potential benefits from taking Flax seed oil: ---  --- Flaxseed Oil lowers cholesterol levels, thereby improving cardiovascular health and lessening the risk of arteriosclerosis.  ---  --- Flaxseed also contains plant nutrients like phytoestrogens. These are natural estrogen-like substances that can lessen the discomfort of menopause. ---  --- Flaxseed oil may lower high blood pressure. ---  --- Flaxseed oil helps some people improve their psoriasis and eczema, as it has anti-inflammatory properties. Flaxseed may also reduce the itching, swelling, and redness associated with certain skin disorders such as acne. ---  --- Flaxseed oil has a positive effect on rheumatoid arthritis due to its ability to calm inflammation.  ---  --- Flaxseed reduces LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol (the body's "bad cholesterol") and lowers triglyceride levels. Research shows that flaxseed oil gives much better protection against heart attacks than canola oil or olive oil.  ---  --- Taking flaxseed may reduce cancer risk. This is because flaxseed contains the richest sources of lignan building blocks, which play a major role in preventing cardiovascular diseases and cancer. New research indicates that the lignans in flaxseed have both short-term and long-term protective effects against colon cancer.  ---  --- Nature Made Flaxseed Oil is a quality source of flaxseed oil, as the company is well-known and reputable. One tip: keep your flaxseed oil away from light and heat, as both degrade the oil.  ---  --- The usual beneficial dose of Flaxseed Oil is 2-3 capsules once per day taken with a meal.   ---  --- Jim "Konedog" Koenig  --- 
Works great,good price,fast shipping.good packaging. All is well. ---           Thanks, Larr
im not sure why i gave this a second star; maybe its because i feel guilty for always loathing everything john malkovich is associated with? directed and written by spike jonze and charlie kaufman (the same duo who gave us the equally pretentious "adaptation"), this one centers around an unsuccessful puppeteer (john cusack) who figures out how to enter into the body of actor john malkovich for 15 minutes at a time and manages to turn that talent into riches and fame but oh my he still isnt happy even tho he gets to hang out with cameron diaz
I've been looking for a pair of headphones like this for years.  I've used these for 8 months now and wear them almost everyday.  I ride a motorcycle everyday and I never leave without these.  First, the comfort is exceptional.  Even with my helmet on, I never get uncomfortable with these in my ears.  I've ridden 400 miles at a time without any problems.  Even when I need a break from the music, I leave these in because they do such a great job of blocking wind and bike noise.  I've used several other brands of canal earphones and none have been comfortable - tolerable at best, but most are painful with a helmet on.  The "bulb" you see in the picture rests in the crook of your ear, so there is nothing extending past your ear to get crammed in deep.  Second, the sound quality is fantastic.  Great bass, mids, and highs.  I've heard things in my music I never knew was there and I can't wait to listen more.  I can't recommend these enough.  I've bought a pair for my brother and may have to buy a pair for my wife because she keeps taking mine
This is fantastic!  Great music, Great story,  Awesome photography!   I promise you will love  this film
Some of the best lighting I have ever seen on face of that hunk C. Tommy.  John Peters is a genius
My boys spend more time trying to play with this potty then trying to use it. It's fun and it's a miniature size adult potty. They love it. The seat is a little on the smaller side so one of my two year olds is outgrowing it already, but we are making it work. We have had other potties where the seat is a little bigger
I just saw this move for the first time in wide screen and it is a much different experience I must say. I think I have figured it out. In some other reviews I think Batricia Birch should have just stayed with the songs and the numbers. I think they should have got another director to get the rest of the movie off the ground. It is somewhat of a good story. I can see why it would be reversed (a guy trying to get the girl, instead of the other way around). You see Eugine in the beginning of the movie stumbling out of the bus. Well if he were a senior in the first one then why is he in the second one???? Also Frenchie is not with the Pink Ladies at all. You see her by herself or just briefly with the other pink ladies in school. I think the chemistry between Stephanie and Michael were worked well together. The songs were written by the same people that wrote the songs for the first movie. So really the bottom line is that they should have gotten a different director altogether. I know I know it is not the first one. But sequels are usually not, but they usually have connections to the first. Grease 2 tried to accomplish with Frenchie and the Tbirds, Pink ladies and all. I am glad they were able to have Eve Arden, Sid Ceaser, plus other great actors of the 50s and 60s like Tab Hunter. Is this movie cheesy???? Yes  --- Is it done in less than expected direction???? Yes. Does it have good songs??  Yes (Cool Rider, Reproduction, We'll Always be Together, Girl for all Seasons/Turn Back, and Back to School). The song skits themselves are good and with the same flavor of the first one. After all Kiddies, Patricia Birch did do the choreography for both.  --- So, in closing, this movie made it to my DVD collection if for that reason alone. If Grease 2 is going to stink then let it reek. If it has its moments of good cute fun then let it have that. I think if you loved the first Grease then I think you should at least give this one a try.     
I'm a big fan of "The Boss", but for the life of me, can't fathom why he is unable to follow the lead of larger acts, and actually "unplug" for MTV Unplugged.  This CD offers no new material that can't be found elsewhere, and is basically nothing more than a "live in concert" CD that just so happened to be filmed by MTV. ---  --- This concert took place in 1992, and you know it's pretty bad when you have bands ribbing you three years later about going on MTV UNPlugged, and then having to go and plug in.  It's not like Bruce doesn't know how to play acoustic guitar, because he does.  I'm a big acoustic guitar fan, and for someone of Bruce's talent level, to not be able to write songs that can be played acoustically only serves to bring down the level of respect I have for his talent. ---  --- Not what I would consider an essential recording, and not recommended, unless you are such a die-hard "Boss" fan that you have to own every album he puts out.  Otherwise, save your money
these are the greatest invention in bottles...ever.....these bottles helped my daughter so much....no more gas,no spills or leaks...the only downside is they are hard to clean..but who cares...
excellent product  --- my hair was striaght and dry in a matter of minutes
I recently purchased the software above only to find it does not support my dvd drive  (HL-DT-ST RW/DVD GCC-4482B (1.00)I have unsuccessfully tried to contact roxio support three times.  No response.  I did go through the long list of supported drives and also emailed my problem to Roxio.  Needless to say, I am very disappointed and do not recommend the purchase of this software.  --- I have a new Gateway desktop that came with the above drive. --- 
I read all 33 of the other reviews here to get other perspectives - a lively debate.  There were so many brilliant things said about the film, that I found myself passing out "Helpful" votes (to both positive & blisteringly negative reviews) like they were candy.  The movie is an evocative work of art.  I encourage people to read all the reviews if they want to enjoy the movie from many different points of view.  I agree with many of the positive and negative comments that have been made by other reviewers, but I will limit my comments to items not previously mentioned. ---  --- The DVD cover gives the false impression that this is a love story about two young lovers, a sort of "Blue Lagoon" from the Renaissance.  It is not.  It is misleading. ---  --- I concede a) the story is probably not historically accurate, b) statutory rape occurred and probably rape under any definition, & c) Tossi was probably inconsiderate, conceited, and immoral.  But the quality of a film is not judged solely on historical accuracy and the high morality of the characters.  Having said that, I do object that the movie, according to the rape trial transcript and some of the best evidence available, is not just inaccurate, but oppositional to what probably occurred.  Therefore, I critique the film for portraying itself as the story of a real person.  The movie stumbles internally because it tries to justify actual historical effects with fictional (or incorrect) causal factors.  And those cause-effect relationships don't seem to ring true. ---  --- Having said that, I agree with some of Richard Burt's review comments that "historical accuracy" may still be subject to interpretation.  It is reasonable that Artemisia may have been more adversarial speaking in a public rape trial (defending her freedom and reputation) than she might have been with Tassi personally.  And it seems too easy to just paint Tassi as a purely evil character as other reviewers have done.  There is usually more complexity and diverse/conflicting interests in most people, especially artists. ---  --- One strong objection - near the end of the film, Artemisia says, "No one dies of sorrow."  While there is probably some intended sarcasm in the comment, the line frustrated me.  People DO die of sorrow.  My limited experience has suggested that some of the smartest, most sensitive, artistic, and caring people I've encountered were the same people most threatened by sorrow.  And the people I have admired the most are the same people who have been mortally threatened by sorrow.  Not selfish, controlling, or passive-aggressive sorrow, but rather sorrow that comes from other less obvious motivations - often unidentified & misunderstood misconceptions.  Sorrow can lead to literal death and deaths of the spirit, character, the soul, & creativity.  Sorrow is not incidental.  Sorrow can destroy health.  Or as the Angel of America in "Angels in America" says, "The body is the garden of the soul."  Sorrow is worth full attention. ---  --- The movie tries to examine the effect of Artemisia's loyalties to her father and her teacher.  The screenwriter is not bent on us assessing those relationships as simply "good" or "bad"; both relationships are drawn as having both good or bad effects on Artemesia.  Her loyalties encourage her artistry and her expression.  They work to create an environment that does not inhibit or conceal her gifts.  At the same time, they are so intrusive that they almost certainly affect her choices, privacy, and pacing beyond her desired level of influence. ---  --- Artemisia realizes she would probably not be the painter she becomes except for her father's drive and design.  At the same time, she also laments that his constant intervention narrowed the occupations she could participate in - in polite society. ---  --- May your loyalties encourage seeking and speaking the best personal truths you can find.  And may the best personal truths you can find shape your loyalties. ---  --- Compare Caravaggio's "Judith Beheading Holofernes" to Artemisia's version of the same painting.  Her version is more violent, realistic (less idealized in posing, dirtiness, lighting, etc.).  Her version has the female servant actively helping Judith.  Artemisia's paintings show a palpable understanding of hate, violence, sexuality & compassion.  Artemisia likely became expressive of the personal feelings and experiences she knew best.  That's why people care about whether a movie about her life characterizes her experiences accurately - because we want to know what led her to her creative decisions
Brainwashing is not a good way to educate young people about the world around them.  This is a blatant effort to wrench young children's emotions and therefore their perspectives  about the eeeevil effects of "global warming" by engaging their sympathies.  The only plot is brainwashing, using penguins as the straw man.  The penguin world is factually well documented if one is interested in teaching children about them.  As a responsible parent, I would avoid this entirely.
i must say i was hesitant to buy after reading the reviews, but they are for my two year old, so i figured they really couldn't be too small. and they are not. i also purchased other earring from some other vender for a lot more $, and guess what, the quality of theese is soooo much better. all in all, yes they are tiny, but very cute and don't lack detail! will buy again
I just purchased a new heating pad to replace the one I had for years. I read the reviews and could not decide between all the choices, price being the primary concern. The saying you get what you paid for is true !! The heating pad works ok but the outer edges of this pad scratch you and the covering cloth is very cheap. Pay more and be happier
I was pleased with the magazine but even though I renewed my suscription for the third year (and I was charged!) I never got any more magazines. Upon requesting Amazon what had happened, they answered that they would not accept my renewal (no reason whatsoever) that they'd return my money (not yet, after 6 months) and that they would send 2 or 3 issues at no cost for my trouble...(I haven't gotten anything). I don't trust suscriptions throu Amazon anymore
picture sound all great. the only problem is that you must have an advanced degree in english,engineering,and computer science to set the television up.  without my cable company making a house call setup is impossibl
Worked as expected. A few hardware glitches but that was to be expected
I clearly do not share the enthusiasm of some of the reviewers here, who will all have to forgive me for thinking that Susan Cooper's "The Dark Is Rising" is plain awful. This book was recommended to Harry Potter fans who have run out of HP books to read. I must say it was a waste of my time to read "Dark." ---  --- Never have I read a book in which no physical description is given for the hero. In this case, we are told that on his 11th birthday, an English boy named Will Stanton discovers he is the last of "The Old Ones." Unlike JK Rowling who, in the first pages of Harry Potter & the Philosopher's (or Sorcerer's) Stone, provides the reader with a vivid description of Harry as skinny, with an unruly mop of black hair, startlingly green eyes, and, of course, a lightning-bolt scar on his forehead, Cooper does not describe Will Stanton at all. The result is that the reader, after having read 244 pages, still cannot visualize what Will looks like!! ---  --- I also find quite annoying Cooper's approach to this good vs. evil tale. She is vague and abstract till the end as to who exactly are The Old Ones, and who or what exactly is The Dark. As for The Dark being evil, all the reader succeeds in gleaning is that The Dark means cold, snow, and--of course--darkness. Excuse me: but is this the best Cooper can do?  --- Is this what this book is about?--the Druid pagan worldview of light vs. dark, summer vs. winter, warmth vs. cold? What happened to the conception of evil as MORAL evil?
Granola was very dry and not too sweet.  Need milk.  I prefer Costco's granola -- it taste much better.  I would not recommend the purchase of this product.  Now I got to find way to get rid of the other 5 packages.  Also bought the fruit and nut one.  Hope that's better. 
Short of having an extra limb the hinged grate allows for roasting/grilling with much less heat loss.  The extra control of the heat source allows for a better cooked product.  "This steak is b--tching", was a quote from the gameday crowd at Jack Kent Cook Stadium at fedex field in Maryland.  I will continue to "Pimp My Grill" with more accessories for next season
This film is visually stunning and impressive, and has talented and credible actors.   ---  --- Unfortunately, there is barely a story with a lot of poorly-developed characters who are "trained"/brainwashed and instructed in the ways of death and inhumanity.   ---  --- The settings and group "sermons" from Nazi officials are striking and convincing, but there is nothing that ties it all together.  Our hero fails to strike the "killer blow" and is stripped, literally and figuratively, of all status and walks away.  The end. ---  --- I'm forced to comment that this is marketed as a gay film, and I was surprised by how un-gay it was.  In fact, the two boy "friends" work together at one point to spy on a lady in a state of undress.  It's more about a childhood relationship in the midst of chaos than anything else.  ---  --- I have issues with some of the pacing as well.  I found myself pressing the fast forward button several times, and didn't really seem to miss much.  Not a good sign. ---  --- So, for what it is, it's okay.  Certainly not a masterpiece, and certainly not something to run out and buy. 
This hose hanger is sturdy and lovely and adds some much needed  character to the front of our house!  A great deal
These replacement styluses fit perfectly into the phone and are an exact replacement for the original phone stylus
I gave it my friends. --- They says it's very good and delicious
I received the card organizer as a birthday gift and love it-it something I would never buy for myself-and you always need cards for all occasions!  The cards are beautiful!  This would be a great teacher gift! 
This grill cover is pretty much as generic as you can imagine.  Not only is the vinyl material that it is made of thin and easily tear-able, the drawstring at it's base is very easily prone to breaking.   ---  --- I have bought and had to return this product twice already.  Save yourself the trouble and look up market for something that you can depend on for a little longer than a single use
Originally, I purchased this heavy-duty case to protect my new expensive 8525.  However, wearing the case on my belt with the belt clip, my phone fell out of the case several times when the case cover accidentally opened up.  Luckily the phone was not functionally damaged, but I have several big dents and scratches on the case.  I'm going to stop using a case now, since the phone is now already beat-up. ---  --- The latch mechanism for the cover will loosen up with use, especially since you'll have to open and close it repeatedly to access the touch screen.  Also, it took a bit getting used to, to have to open the case to make a phone call. ---  --- The overall quality of this case is very good tho, because it fits the phone very snuggly and the holes line up to all the buttons. ---  --- I guess its a great case if you don't wear it on your belt.  But I can't justify such a huge case if I carry it in my pocket.
I bought this because I love all the other Fisher Price Aquarium stuff we have. But... we haven't been thrilled with this tub. The hammock can only be used until the baby is 10 lbs if i'm remembering correctly -- well our child was over 9 lbs at birth... so she used it like 2 weeks. Even so, the hammock sags onto this HARD BUMP in the middle of the hammock so the baby's back rests on this bump. Never seemed comfortable. Then we used it with the hammock attached only at the top like the instructions say but our daughter outgrew the infant side because her butt would slide right over the bump that was supposed to support her but she can't sit up to use the other side. There are better tubs out there
I've owned this item for almost a full year and I am extremely pleased with it. It's so nice being able to carry around my laptop and my books in the same bag. The side pockets are kind of useless for them being so small, but I guess I'll be able to find a purpose for them.
The skin is a great idea, but it is not practical.  It is too thick to work with the Seidio Cradle I have, so I must pull off the skin to sync my Treo.  The skin buttons do not always line up with the TREO buttons, so I misfire applications.  The holster is a joke as it snaps over top the expansion card slot constantly ejecting the card every time I pull the phone off the holster.  Do not place the phone in your pocket with the skin on unless you need to see the inside of your pocket liner as it will not come out cleanly
My son received this toy for his first birthday!  I will be purchasing it as gifts for all my friends!!  He LOVES pushing the button and listening the the music.  I was wondering if he would be able to figure out the gears, but he has caught on very quickly and loves to take the gears off and put them back on.  He also enjoys stacking the gears up and watching them go around!  I like that it has a handle so he can carry it around with him.  It keeps him involved for up to 20 minutes at a time!   --- It is very durable as he carries it around, has chewed on the gears (which are made of strong plastic and cannot be marred by chewing on them). ---  --- My three year old also likes to play with it!  Her play is a little sofisticated with it as she tries to figure out which gears have to be put where (as in, do they have to be next to the middle spinning one) placed to make them spin and how many can be stacked and they still turn. ---  --- My one wish is that Playskool would include a few extra gears.  We have them everyhwere in our house and cannot always find them all.  It would be great if they had a place where you could purchase extra ones for replacements and/or to have extras for stacking. ---  --- This is an awesome toy that the kids love, can learn from, and is very durable!  It is a must have!
Would highly recommend. We attend dog show that are in the middle of no were... This product got us to EVERY SHOW  we have been to since we started using it in March 2007.We especially in enjoyed the feature of being able to find what kind of business were in the area were.We hate getting lost especially with a truck loaded down with dogs and conformation equiptment, this product has stopped that from happening.   It would be nice if the 2008 version: 1 - it spoke the name of the streets while it was giving you the next turn 2- it would get rid of that agreement screen everytime you use it, once should be enough and 3 - It would be nice if we could log on to the web and down load the latest addition of gas station, place to eat and etc...  while we were down loading the construction updates. This product is a good buy for the money.. 
Why American production make HK movies look so cheap? First of all, they cut off so much scene, second of all ruin it by making look act so dumb by English Dubb. ALWAYS stick with ORIGINAL LICENSED HK RELEASE. Be careful with cheap imports, boots, and bulls though
I'm surprised this show got past Season 1. Honestly, more talent can be found in my local karaoke bar. This show does NOT discover talent, they produce and market it. It is really demeaning to musicians everywhere. The judges are a joke, I guess the producers tell them what to say. Simon "the jerk" Cowell tries hard to be rude to everyone, hey...he has made a living out of it. Randy Jackson's vocab is limited to "yo", "yeah" and "dawg". Paula, who's the only one who I think deserves to even comment on the singers..unfortunately praises everyone, be it for their performance/energy/character/looks/(fill with any word of your choice). All in all, a total disaster...only in shows this sh*tty, can no-talents like William Hung be hailed as a celebrity. I am shocked people other than the families of those participating would actually spend time and money voting for these posers. On a more positive note, it's good that people don't actually buy the albums, thus resulting in total disappearing acts from Idol winners like Ruben and Fantasia...now we just need the American public to stop tuning in to the shows. Well, hope is all we have, right
  Molly, daughter or Richard- I usually write positive reviews on this site but not this time. Why on earth do dermatologists recommend this s***? Last year my hormones were all out of wack and I had a period for a whole month. I broke out severely as one would expect. Dermatologists  (including mine) swear by this aweful chetaphil. I HATE IT! It wasnt strong enough for my skin. It made my acne even worse if you can imagine! I'd been using it for four months when I finally decided enough was enough and I started using Neutrogena Frangrance Free Facial Cleanser. That change made all the difference in the world! I still do have acne but now it is mild acne instead of severe acne. Now its mostly just old, light scarring and the occasional breakouts around my chin and lips the week before my period.  One of my friends is a dietition and she also has used Cetaphil and didnt like it at all. Please do not buy Cetaphil even if your dermatologist recommends it. You will totally regret it
I bought 2 necklaces for each daughter for Christmas.  The girls wear them all the time, they are very pretty and love opening up the lockets to look at the pictures we put them
Well, it is a cool product, and good idea to use. But the bulb was broken in first 3 days. We put the second one on. Dont know how long this second one will last. We used it only few minutes in the morning, when we need to get some cloth out of closet. ---  --- Also, it is not on line product only. I found Bed Bath Beyond has it and CVS has it. They sell 9.99. Without extra bulb. But still, misleading to say online only.
After experiencing the same thing that many on here have witnessed (after 8 hours the smoker didn't get hot enough, and I had to finish my meat in the oven), I decided to ask Char-broil support on their website what I can do to remedy the situation.   ---  --- Their answer, and I quote, "Thank you for your response. To purchase replacement parts, please contact Grill Lover's at 1-800-241-8981 24 hours a day 7 days a week to place an order. We apologize for the inconvenience. If you have any further questions or concerns, please let us know." ---  --- WHAT??  They expect you to purchase a replacement part in order for their POS smoker to actually work??  What's a warranty worth??  BEWARE - this thing is worthless without some modification or purchasing expensive spare parts
This is a well engineered product; I cannot call it a toy because it is much much more than that. After building just one of the sample setups I was able to put down the manual and start creatively designing and building my own. My daughter (3.5 years old) loves it. She really likes placing a marble on the run when I tell her its time to "test it", and I let her identify the error. The only marbles that have fallen off the track are due to construction errors by myself. After 1 day (and several of our own setups) we already find ourselves wanting more pieces. I suggest buying the largest set from the get go if you have an engineering type mind or just enjoy puzzles. Nice feature to note : the coloring of the blocks is logical; each color has its own unique function(s).
This was an inexpensive ring for a great price.  It was a good buy for a HS niece who loves her celtic heritage and the color blue
Golf Digest is the best magazine, covers great players, have standard lessons from top golf teachers and schools and allways very useful tips. --- However, it only has one thing against... too much advertising or too many advertisers!!
If you just like the cruiser look and will use the bike only occasionally for very short rides (less than 10 miles) then this is probably not a bad bike. BUT, if you want a much more comfortable and efficient bike, and one that will fit your body properly, go to your local bike shop and ask to see their "hybrid" bikes. This type of bike gets its name from being a cross between a "road bike" and a "mountain bike" or "all terrain" bike. They are available in several frame sizes, so you're not stuck with "one-size-fits-all", which is NOT good if you are shorter than about 5'7 or taller than about 5'10. Hybrids are available in a wide range of prices and equipment selections. The price will range from just over $200 to as high as you want to go (over $1500 anyway). As the price goes up, the weight generally goes down and the quality of the frame and all components goes way up. But even at the low end of the scale, a hybrid will be a much more efficient bike to ride (more miles covered per energy expended) and it will be more comfortable on longer rides (over 10 miles). If you are truly interested in covering some longer distances (up to maybe 30-40 miles) focus on the models that feature 700C wheels as opposed to 26-inch--your bike shop person can explain--and keep the tire width down to 35mm or under (28mm is a good size for most people if they ride only on pavement). The narrower tires offer less "rolling resistance" making the bike easier to pedal and the larger wheel sizes improves efficiency a little also. ---  --- Happy peddaling, --- A VERY experienced cyclis
I ordered this item on September 10, 2006.  As of January 12, 2007 I have still not received the ordered item but the pictures of it sure are nice.  One star is one star too many
I purchased this for an Oktoberfest party, there was a lot left over, mostly because people were slightly intimidated or mostly really drunk.  The sweet tasted nicely and were decorated in a very pretty way.  I'd recommend this to anyone who doesn't want to make their own marzipan and needs to purchase a large quantity.  There are several little "flats" of the candies so you can package them seperately or give a flat away to a friend easily enough
Finally, a product that does as it promises.  Excellent sun burn protection -- even in Hawaii
These two packets of panties were too large.  I also didn't like the cotton.  Since I had opened one packet of three I kept it, but  I sent the unopened packet of 3 back because I didn't like them. --- Jeanne Allen
The watch was shipped in a timely manner, actually I receive the watch a few days sooner than the expected delivery date. I purchased this product as a gift for my son.  When I opened the package it was everything the site said it would be and more. My son and I am very pleased with the watch. I do agree with a previous review stating that this watch is not for a small frame man. Although, this is not a problem for me because my son likes the larger watches, I took it to have it resized for him and it fits perfect
My hair stylist first introduced me to this product a few years ago and I've used it ever since. It makes your hair really soft and shiny and even smells good. Just a little of biosilk goes a long way. Gets rid of the frizz and dryness and really improves the look and feel of your hair. I definitely reccomend it
I gave a detailed review of the base system, but the handset merits comments separately.  I have purchased handsets for every room in the house, and because I don't like using the clip to carry it with me everywhere, I use them.  They're easily customizable through the PC interface, although they can be customized without it as well.  Each handset gets its out name, so transferring calls or paging a handset is simple.  (No more trying to remember which room has the "fifth" handset.)  I've been impressed with both the battery life and the range of each handset; I've read reviews that criticized the range or sound quality, but I've had no trouble with either despite a few different usage scenarios.  If you're shopping for one of these, then you've already got the base unit or are considering purchasing it, so you know the quality to expect.  I think the Uniden CLX485 is the best residential phone system I've ever experienced; the handset lives up to that standard, too
Now, this isn't the fastest card on the market.  But it is a solid, reliable card.  The camera itself is the bottle kneck, and typically not this card.  However, if you are using a Canon DSLR of a recent flavor, I would check if it needs to be RMA'd.  A known quantity of these cards have proven to lose images.  scary.  However, I've not experienced the mysterious loss of images with my card or Rebel XT.  I've only ever pushed the cards speed limits with my PD70X, and definately not with my Rebel XT
Why mess with the original.  There are a lot of phonies and copycat controllers that you can get for a discount.  You get what you pay for.  I have several of the standard ones like this and they are quality.  In addition the controls for the Gamecube are similar enough to other Nintendo products so you won't have to learn a completely new system
I have thick in-between wavy and straight hair that is also dry and frizzy. Other curl enhancing lotions I have tried have made my hair feel crunchy, hard and sticky, yuck! Not this one. After I wash and condition my hair I apply this spray to almost dry hair, scrunch it and let it air dry. It gives my otherwise limp, frizzy waves definition, lift and bounce. It even adds shine and smells great, sort of like watermelon. It also looks more natural and is much easier than having to use a curling iron. The spray is easy to use and you can't really use too much of it, which is a problem I've had with other products. In between washes I just spray my hair with water and scrunch it to reactivate the waves.
This has a run down of the colts season from game one to the Super Bowl.Thats it.Do not expect the Super Bowl without commercials and edited down because thats not what this is.Very disappointing.The AFC championship game of the week is just a post game show.I would have loved to see at least the 2nd half of that game.It was better then the Super Bowl.The only good things where the few extras with Manning and Harrison wired for sound.I hope there is a better one come'n cause this is not worth much
I thought that these would be great, but could never get them to work right. Sometimes they would flow sometimes not. I would have to take the bottom off to make it work and then remember to put it back on after using them or dump it all over. To many pieces, to much trouble, I would be upset and my baby would be also! Switched to Avent and loving it
I would have to say that there is nothing whatsoever WRONG with the band Jet, but when you don't have any particular characteristics to call your own, there's nothing to complain about. Of course, this means that there's nothing to compliment, either..except maybe that they do an excellent job sounding a hell of a lot like too many other bands. People compliment them on bringing the 'old' and adding the 'new...' but I hear nothing new in their music. It's just ordinary, clichï¿½d classic rock, except for some reason no one told them that the classic rock era was about 40 years ago. If I want to listen to classic rock, I want to hear it on the classic rock stations, not the modern rock stations. Those are for the new songs, only. ---  --- An indepth and entertaining review of this album can be found at the Pitchfork Media website...I can't post the link due to strict review guidelines.
Excellent product!
I have been working for a major daily newspaper in Baltimore for 2 decades. Perhaps that will qualify me as an expert in photography. I have been shooting digital imagery since the late 1990s. Maybe that qualifies me as an expert in digital photography. This may be long- winded, but it's extensive and can be useful.  ---   ---  I received the Nikon D2H camera -- 2 bodies total -- over one year ago. I think I got them shortly after the D2H system was released in 2003. Since then, I have used them to shoot images of all types -- documentary, sports, daytime, available light, flash, and dead- of- night -- for the paper I work for. This is the only camera I work with.  ---   ---  First, please read the manual. There is a ton of information there, and the information is terrific to begin with. The D2H is highly- configurable, with screen after screen that you can set for your own specific use (resist lending the camera to anyone for a long period of time, for your camera may be returned with many of your settings changed so much that it acts like a thoroughly different camera).  ---   ---  I'll just punch right in to the way it feels. The camera is a rather heavy beast, and for some, there can be an amount of shoulder or neck fatigue when using it for hours per day, like I do. But the camera feels well in hand and the controls are easy to move through. I've long since given up using any camera bag. All I have are a fanny pack for a 14mm, 55mm, teleconverters and 2 extra camera batteries and flashes clipped to its belt. And the D2H's hold the 17-35mm Nikon and the 80-200mm Nikon one- touch or the Sigma 120-300mm 2- touch.  ---   ---  Shooting is a breeze. The batteries let you shoot long before the need to recharge. I have my D2H set on ISO 200 or 400 most of the time and sacrifice shutter speed for lower ISO as often as I can, because the higher ISOs bring digital noise and a loss in color saturation. Just today, I purchased digital noise plug ins for Photoshop to limit this, and that's a wonderful thing to invest in with this camera when you must shoot action photography with no flash at ISO 800 and above.  ---   ---  I now have little problems with capturing images in even barely- limited lighting. I recently shot stars and a plane wing from my seat of an Airbus at 36,000 feet over the Pacific at 30 seconds wide open @ f/ 2.8, and it looks tons better than night shots via the D1H, which lacked the internal digital noise filter. That filter kicks in at around 1/2 second and longer exposures, and can make you wait as long as your image you've shot to strip your long exposure of much of the digital noise. When you shoot this way (and in general), don't simply react by cranking up ISO because you will not be happy with your results.  ---   ---  The camera can be loud. At over 7 frames per second, it can make you obvious in a quiet room. Shooting sensitive situations can be testy, so limit your shooting to single frames. I wish this camera had an option to silence this camera, but since the mirror has to raise and lower, there's no chance to do this.  ---   ---  Am I happy with the D2H? Definitely, yes. Are there improvements that can be made? Yes. But the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. People have been bailing out of using the Nikon system and going Canon, which has some incredible gear, I won't deny that. But instead of simply giving up on your system of equipment, learn how to use the D2H well and you'll be much happier than ever. And that means you should push its qualities to the max while respecting its limitations.  ---   ---  For instance, white balance. This can be the best thing for you, or the worst thing you've ever dealt with, depending upon how you approach it. Daylight, grey skies, dusk and dawn are easy, because you can set the camera to daylight, flash, shadow (for dusk and dawn times) and even the fluorescent and incandescent tend to be right in the ballpark. But the horrible mixed light or the street lamps that glow blue/green or orange- red from mercury vapor can be the death of an image if you don't properly use white balance. Preset white balance is king, here. I can get grey, black and white when I preset in mercury vapor light. And I used the preset for any light that the auto white balance setting can't figure. There is also a setting to dial in kelvin temps as well! If you do this (and I can go on for miles here), you're on your way. So, with trying this D2H, or considering it, read through some of the digital D2H forums and ignore the posts that slam the camera without giving instances. Generally, those who pan the camera have not tried to understand it. I can bang off images to disprove where they suggest this camera will fail. When you have decent light, you'll have a decent image. But when you try to use it without learning how you can maximize the system, you will come about shooting images that are terrible and unprintable.  ---   ---  In closing, I have not been paid by anyone, I have no Nikon stock and have no outside interest in writing this except that I'm giving the D2H credit where it's long overdue
Its a cable, it works, what else do you want?  I know its not the cheapest one out there, but this one says "sony" on it.  Yea!!  But, I am a true believer that you only get what you pay for.  Im sure its better quality than the five dollar version at the flea market.  who knows, but I sure feel all warm and fuzzy about getting quality sony products. 
The original CSI series is FANTASTIC because you figure out the crimes by finding the evidence.  This series uses the CSI name without the investigating that makes the original so good.  It is mainly a mellow-drama surrounding the lives of the characters.  Some people will like the drama the writers have put togethor, but there's no mystery
My wife and I put this thing together in about an hour.  There was one cracked foot tread, but after calling Schwinn, we had a replacement within two days and no hassles.  If you are looking for a decent machine at a great price, this is a nice one.  It is fairly sturdy and has some nice preprogrammed workouts
This toy, like several other Mattel toys I've purchased in the past 5 years are difficult to put together, troublesome to play with, and not durable. I wish Mattel would think more about the kids playing with their toys and less about the stockbrokers. Toys can be easy to assemble. Intuitive to play with and rugged as a tank. It just depends on priorities of the toy design/builder
These socks do not fit the sizes specified. The elastic is so tight that you can hardly get them on your feet. I gave them to my 12 yr. old son and they were too tight on him also, I threw them out. This is the first and last time I will buy those socks. The Reebok sneakers are great though
I was quite disappointed by this book, I was expecting something with more professional level content. It's all very amateur however, the artwork used in the examples is sub-professional at best. --- I was hoping that the book would deal with some of the specific Pre-Press issues relating to comics artwork, but the chapter there was frustratingly slight. You would be much better to buy a a more general pre-press book. --- The quality of the packaging and printing were also quite poor for a book that cost this much
It could cover the tattoo, but after while, it fails. Not fully invisible
This tastes nothing like buttered corn on the cob. In fact it tastes exactly like regular salted white popcorn with no butter. On the positive side it's not greasy... but don't expect anything exciting from the taste
I have to start off by saying if you own the 06 version, then dont bother updating, as you may not notice many of the updates/upgrades. ---  --- Is this an awesome game? Yes, but it has a few holes even still; 1) Too much sacking on your QB by the cpu. 2)The CPU will run the ball so darn often, it is a joke. 3)The game might strain your PS2 as it loads so often,4)If you want to play on all-madden level, you are FORCED to play with QB vision on, which we all know stinks! ---  --- Basically, they have tossed in a few more options so you can play as a blocker or etc on offense and you have more advanced defensive controls such as match-ups, assignments, etc. Also, the franchise mode is still really great and the superstar mode is quite enjoyable as well. ---  --- What about this game is really good? Well, it is safe to say the graphics are quite good and the commentary is solid once again. The crispness of the passing is great and the running game is a big part of this years focus. It is still really fun to have a running QB with a strong arm, it is an easy way to dominate the game! BTW, the new kicking scheme is actually really easy after test it out a time or two, now I am making 90% FG's easily! You can fully tinker with the AI and change all other settings as well. ---  --- The rosters are also accurate but personally, if you own madden 06, wait 4-6 more weeks and then buy this one for $19 as a PS2 best of game
Well, I like the song "I shall believe" and that's why I purchased this Album, but it would have been better to buy just the single
The device shows a lot of info like it should.  Nice design and accurate as well. It's just as good if not better than the television weather forecast and current conditions. The only thing I would improve upon is the readability of the face of the instrument. It has to be read from directly in front or it is not clear enough. 
In the early 60's Etta James was to R&B what Patsy Cline was to country. She could cross over and yet remain true to her roots, and that's only one part of a nearly 50 year career! From the velvety cross over soul of "At Last" to the hard driving Memphis soul of "Tell Mama", this is one legend who certainly deserves a wider audience than she has today. She ranks right up with Aretha Franklin as an influential vocalist. I took far too many years to discover her power. If you haven't given her a serious look yet, stop wasting time and begin here
These may be healthy, but you'll have to force yourself to eat it.  It tastes like paste with some fruit.  I would give them one star, but I give them some credit for trying to make something healthy
I purchased this as a gift for a teenager.  She told me that it is difficult to zip as the fabric gets stuck in the zipper.  It is being returned
Bought this camera for my wife.  Takes good pictures but handle this camera with extreme caution.  If you drop it be prepared for a large repair bill.  Fuji customer relations is sub-par.  Warranty does not cover any impact internal damage.  I've had better luck with Nikon and Kodak and will steer clear of Fuji in the future
this pendant is really nice. i bought it as a gift. it is just the pendant so you do have to get a chain.
This is an excellant product. Cooks up very well, great with  any sauces,mac'n cheese, and also makes a fantastic macaroni salad.  The price from Amazon was really a bargain as all gluten free foods are so very, very expensive. I just wish we didn't have to buy so many packages as storage becomes a problem
 --- Turbotax was a great service, but I would like to be able to navigate with menus/tabs to a greater degree of specificity within the input pages itself. Writing the return often requires back-tracking to a page that you alread covered. --- To get to a particular prior page, I would often be forced to go through up to 5 or 6 prior pages, reading the question each time because turbotax highlighted the default which was not my previous choice. This was a colossal waste of time in an otherwise excellent product. It could easily be fixed in the 2006 software if turbotax 1) switched the defaults to the users' previously-inputted values (CompleteTax does this and it seems like an obvious thing to do) and/or made it easy to navigate to a prior page by giving a link to every input page when a user clicks a superior tab or link. This is what a good web-page does, and it would be very helpful if turbotax did the same.  
One of the better weekly magazines that covers world affairs from what's on the news around the world to some pretty obscure things like Imelda Marcos' shoes to life in China, a society not at ease with the globalisation of the world.  TIME did a really good article on how Google has allowed itself to be sensored in the name of finance, makes you realise that Human Rights don't exsist when the dollar signs are being totted up! ---  --- The UK edition pretty much follows the USA edition, it's an easy read, and what's good is that every now and again TIME puts out a special edition which often follows a theme, the last one was on Christopher Columbus. ---  --- Worth getting a subscription, also you can do what I do, when you've read a copy, give it to your local dentist or Doctor for their waiting room
I had to take a look at this book just like I did Rachel Shteir's previous book "Striptease" to see if the online reviews were true. Sadly, they were. Like "Striptease", this book was full of typo's and appeared poorly organized and written. One would think that Ms. Shteir would have learned from her previous book--which also had similarly poor reviews. I wonder why Gypsy Rose Lee paired up with her. I can only guess at Ms. Shteir's fascination with this topic: my guess is that she wishes she could be a stripper herself (or maybe she is). I base this in part on a meeting with Ms. Shteir a year ago when I invited her to write about a professional conference I organized and presented at: she wore a very low-cut blouse as she interviewed people. I'm no prude but this was highly inappropriate and distracting people told me. On top of that, her article was chock full of misquotes, errors in fact, and adopted a perspective that nobody who attended the conference could relate to. Oh well, I can only hope that Ms. Shteir's next project will be more accurate and also that she will make clear her real interest in her subject matter. Gypsy Rose, I guess we both made the same mistake: trusting someone like Ms. Shteit to help us tell a story who didn't have the heart or the skills to pull it off
If one likes old westerns, especially written by Louis Lemore, it is excellent and so is the actors, especially Sam Elliot and Katherine Ross
I've had this grill for almost a year now and have had no reliability problems with it.  I purchased mine a Lowe's.  The grill has very good flame/temperature control and the side burner is excellent.  I grill on it seven days a week through the summer months and on warm weekends in the fall.  The heat is pretty even inside there really isn't any major hot/cold spots.  The side burner is nice since it comes with a non stick coated griddle for cooking.  I actually used this feature late fall during a power outage to cook eggs and french toast for breakfast.  The side burner without the griddle has a cast iron pot holder. The lid on the side burner is large enough you can close it when using smaller pots. Very useful on windy or chilly days.  Overall I am extremely pleased with this grill and I have had no rust or wearing issues with it.  The only drawback to the grill's design is the ignitor only works on the far left burner.  It lights the 3 burners from left to right. So If your only using 1 burner for a quick meal like hot dogs or hamburgers for 2 people you need to always use the left burner
Bertie is nice.  He has no magnetic pieces so he won't hook to other things.  Nice 16month old tries to use him on the train track which does work but he wasn't really meant for that and can be hard to push on the track
Gave this as a gift to my father for fathers day!  He loved it!  Said the steaks arrived in excellent condition, packed in dry ice, and we're very enjoyable!  One of the best fathers days gifts
This magazine comes with lots of advertisements - 70% or more. Plus, articles (less than 15 articles in every issue) in the magazines are not very useful.  I subscribed the magazine because it is inexpensive and it is rated high by other subscribers.  Now I realize I made a mistake. 
Opera is intended to be seen - a true multi-media art. But a fascinatingly perfect stage setting aside, this is one production better heard than seen. Sonically, the performances please, but this rates as one of the more visually disturbing casts I have witnessed. --- A 58-year-old Plcido Domingo is simply unconvincing as a young soldier. Aprile Millo, as a well-fed version of the Ethiopian slave girl (in ridiculous black face), Aida, defies the costumers' best attempts to provide a waist line. And Dolora Zaijick mirrors a middle-aged matron more than the Egyptian princess Amneris. --- A fine performance by the ballet troup only draws attention to age and fitness disparities. Like an emperor, the Metropolitan Opera stands as a respected authority. Perhaps this is the impetus behind overenthusiastic curtain calls which prolong the end of each act, but the emperor has no clothes - or at least they need ironing.  --- These are the type of miscastings which turn neophytes off to the idea of opera. Huge fans of these performers who can suspend disbelief may well be pleased, but those craving contextually appropriate performances will find this one age inappropriate
I will not repeat what other reviews have stated already, all the reviews below are pretty much correct with this camera being a high quality and easy to use etc etc. ---  --- The only issue is focusing on a small target such as a name brand logo inside a Rolex watch.  It is HARD even in Manual mode (and I actually have alot of digital camera experience).  Forget trying to focus in AUTO mode, it won't happen.. at least not without alot of tinkering and stress.   ---  --- If you need to take alot of close up pictures of small detailed items (jewelery, insects, etc.) then I recommend buying a digital SLR camera, Nikon D50 is a good one!  This Fuji you are looking at here is perfect for taking pictures of normal things like people, cars, buildings, sites, etc
Stella D'ora fudge cookies were the best dessert I could find in my lunchbox growing up. Its crisp cookie with fudgie middle was perfect with milk or hot tea. Many times I would eat the cookie part and save the fudge center for last to test my patience because there was nothing like eating that chocolate. Stella D'ora was a brand common in NYC grocery stores (and throughout NJ), so everytime I would visit relatives there I would buy the breakfast cookies, annisettes, and the fudge cookies. I have seen the breadsticks in NC but nothing else so its so nice to find that Amazon has them. ---  Stela D'ora always seemed so refined since they were Italian and for adults who liked a little treat with their coffee or cappucinos. My father used to dunk his cookies in coffee and they would become warm and gooey, while I preferred them crisp with milk. Either way, try a package of this and some other biscuits. They really are unbelievably good.
Do not buy this camera, I repeat do not buy this camera! Just read the reviews and you'll know exactly what I mean. Lucky I got this piece of junk for Christmas, so I didn't spend a dime on it. I opened the package BEFORE reading any reviews. Now I wish I've read the reviews before opening the box. I don't care what setting you use, I tried them all and I have yet to take a picture any better than my cell phones camera. The lighting sucks, you either end up with dark pictures or super bright ones. I really wanted this camera to work, it looks sweet but sadly it can't take pictures.
the articles are "good" but the articles are wordy and doesnt get to the point. Too many annoying ads. If u want something to "read" this isnt the magazine for yo
I got the HS805 to call home while trucking. I was sold on the AAA battery power source, because the rechargeable ones won't last on a 14 hour work shift and even then I have no 120V outlet to recharge. ---  --- However, I have to say the audio output when adjusted to max volume is barely audible in an 18 wheeler at highway speeds. The wind and engine noise is much higher than in a car and similar to that heard in a 757 at 35000ft. For this reason alone, this headset is JUNK.  ---  --- The advertisements criminally overstate the talk and standby time as well. With a regular new Duracell AAA battery, I get a low battery tone after about 1 hour of standby. And with a 900mAh Duracell Rechargeable battery I get only 6 hours of standby time before hearing the low battery tone.  ---  --- As for the marketing department at Motorolla, I have to say GREAT JOB for deceiving and misrepresenting an inferior product that lacks stated function and durability. I hope you enjoy earning a check based on lying to people. Hint: Get a job that actually contributes to society versus fleecing society. You should be proud! --- 
I basically love anything Mr. Carter does, but this one has alot of great lyrics (as usual).  I'm so glad he's coming out of retirement.  Any fan of Jay-Z will enjoy this cd
When I bought this cd I did not know that much about supergrass.  The only songs I had even heard were "pumping on the stereo" and "sun hits the sky" and I liked both of these songs a lot.  So while I was cruising the aisles in the record shop, my eyes caught a glimpse of Supergrass is 10, so I decided to buy it because it was at a great price, and I am glad I did.  The CD has not left my car since I bought it two months ago. ---  --- Every single one of the songs can get stuck in your head, and you won'tbe upset.  From the opening track "caught by the fuzz" to the finale "Wait for the sun" the album just rock throughout, and everytime I listen to it I want more.  The album clocks in at 71 minutes, but everytime I am done listenintg to it I feel unfulfilled.  That is a sign of a band making great music
  I got it about 2 months ago and it still works like new. i even left it in a shed uncovered and it still works great. It look very real, but the only bad thing is that the sclincer does nothing to the sound of the gun. THIS GUN IS AWESOME!!!!!
As rosey as this oils smells, it just isn't as good as the real thing.  Being a fragrance oil, it has no medicinal properties.  I certainly wouldn't use it on my skin, or in a bath!  Thanks, but no thanks.  You definitely get what you pay for
I read a review of this in L.A. Weekly which said that it was "a lot  of fun" and entertaining in a sort of ironic way, despite the fact  that it became more slapstick at the end.  I read it, and agreed for the  most part, except I felt that the characters were much stronger and wittier  than I had expected and the author seemed more generous to them than I  would have thought from the initial satirical tone.  The ending was a  little over the top, but it was an example of the kind of senseless  fireworks these characters would have to simulate in their own lives.  All  in all, I thought it was a very intelligent and amusing first novel
Amazingly this compilation has managed to get together some of the most untallented performances of Brahms' music. With a few exceptions the moto of this CD can be summed up as 'no understanding and appreciation for a musical genius'. The choice of music is also quite perfunctory. There are many Brahms pieces that could have served better the bedtime purpose. Buy at your own risk. My only fear is that some people will get their first impressions of Brahms from this CD..
I'm very happy with this tote bag. It's huge and sturdy.  ---  --- I've been using it to bring books and files to and from school for marking. Quite a number of my colleagues like it, too
This movie is laughable today. It's very dated, and it shows. It's not worth your time. The acting is so-so, but felt forced (like William Shatner style). The storyline is okay. By today's standards, it appears like a low budget flick
My friends purchased this watch for me in 1998 as a graduating college/leaving for the Army gift.  I have worn it daily for nine years.  It survived the hardships of an Army lifestyle (I wore it daily then, too) and is still going strong.  I have replaced the battery once and had to have the date bezel removed (the thin silver border) because it popped out after my toddler daughter beat on it on the ground various times (yes, I should have moved it to a higher location).  The lens has minor scratches, but nothing that deters from its simple function and aesthetic charm.  This watch has never failed me.  It is simply the best, most durable, watch that I have ever owned
I was told this magazine was good to look at for design ideas. It isn't really, and there isn't really that much to this magazine.  It is just another tired old AOLTimeWarner publication, just like Time, People, or Teen People.  I looked at the August and September issues and the only things in those two that impressed me were the features on Elton John's Out of Africa fundraiser and the article on Julian McMahon.  The rest of it was ads, and not the classy type ads that make the advertising tolerable in Vogue magazine, but the same old ads you'll see anywhere else, and they are annoying.  There were several nonsense fashion articles with the likes of Kelly Ripa (post excessive Photoshop airbrushing tools-one of my professors would call it "plastic person syndrome") Mark Consuelos, waay too much on Jennifer Garner and her baby, and other weird things, such as the trend of designer cupcakes.  I wish I was kidding on the latter, but I am not, nor do I have $25 to spend on a glorified cupcake just because it is Jessica Alba's favorite.  There was entirely too much dress/act/eat/shop/play this way because the stars do it that way in here.  Despite the size of this magazine, there is very little to sink ones teeth into, just way too many photos of the same old same old, and tips for mimicking them.  I am NOT interested in becoming a Teri Hatcher clone, nor am I interested in seeing Vanessa Carlton's pad.  This magazine is for you if you like excessive ads, no diversity, a subscription that is actually not a year (it says that special issues count as regular issues in the magazine) and your life's ambition is to try a cupcake from a bakery in New York because some celebrity did.  This magazine is mediocre at best, and the worst part is, it has the exact same fashion advice as Vogue.  I went with Vogue because there is substance in their magazine, and the ads are classy and very chic.  Leave this one behind-it looks to me like another brain fluff read from the folks at AOL Time Warner. 
It's a beautifull movie. One of the bests to watch  with your girlfriend. --- Hghly recomended
So I ordered this shirt and I got an entirely diffent one, the packing slip had the right order #. The shirt I received was long sleeved, crew neck with a notch in it. Ans when I called them,the person I spoke to was not the least bit shocked/ amazed or even willing to send the right one, she just said send it back... think twice unless you don't mind making trips to the post offic
I've been using this remote since it was released.  Better than any others I've run into, but when it gets a glitch which all software driven devices are susceptible too, be prepared to give up a couple of hours. ---  --- When it's working, it's a 5 Star device, however...read on as to why I give it a 2. ---  --- As I type this, my hold time is up to 45 minutes on the phone to 2nd level support.  3rd call today. ---  --- I simply got a new PVR.  Programmed OK, but it isn't the default device when I watch TV.  Also, it took two calls to find out my DirecTV PVR is not a PVR, it's a "satellite".  As a "PVR", it couldn't be added to Activities because "you don't have a device that will change channels".  News to me.  Never known a PVR that couldn't change channels. ---  --- Literally, 4 friggin' hours so far and it still not right. ---  --- At some point, the TV suddenly stopped turning on.  2-3 hours on that issue and it's still not right.  TV does not go on until I hit the "Help" button on the remote. ---  --- To add insult to injury, I can't access the website.  Enter my email as an ID and am told it's already in the database.  I ask for a password reminder via email and get a message that my email address is not recognized. ---  --- I hate that the software doesn't have a simple "Home" button.  You have to go through several menus to get back to it.  ---  --- Hold time now up to 52 minutes.  I have to hang up for an appt., so the hold has to be repeated....AGAIN.  ---  --- Oh yeah...I also dislike the size of the buttons, especially the numbers. Cell phone sized. No doubt designed for a dainty child.  ---  --- I could go on, but if another comes out with a product like this one, I'll be looking hard at it
Our 3 children have had hours of fun with this toy during the 2+ years we've had it in our home.  True, the food is long gone (cardboard boxes - toddlers - no surprise there).  We've also needed lash the front piece on with some string (again, it's not constructed to be a bumper car but toddlers don't often keep their play inside the box).  The simple design means that when they twist it beyond reason, it's flexible enough for me to pop it back into alignment.  It's small enough to be comfortable for the 2 year old to push(for hours), and close enough to the real thing to remain interesting for a 5-6 year old.  It's gender neutral, forgiving enough to go down a flight of stairs (repeatedly) without breaking, light enough to not squish whatever's at the bottom.... and sometimes they do even use it to play grocery
Overall, I am satisfied.  So far I have not experienced creep, but I move my car into position very very slowly, so that may help. ---  --- My one suggestion is that it could be wider.  It is easy to slide by if I am just a little off line. ---  --- I have yet to try it on my boat trailer, so that will have to be covered later
This camera looks cool. But it's so, so not cool. ---  --- The people responsible for this device should be ashamed of themselves. This is by far one of the worst products I have ever purchased. EVER. ---  --- By the second day the lens cap no longer stayed in place. It "clips" on... but not for long. The camera's internal memory is rubbish and the camera totally destroyed my memory card somehow. It's complelety unreadable. Even with a 150mb card I could only take a few short quality videos. You can shoot more video if you use the low quality settings. And I'm talkin' LOW quality. Worse than any video you've seen online. ---  --- More problems include the battery cover falling off without hardly even touching it. The controls and interface are not intuitive. You'll probably end up accidentally deleting files you meant to keep. Oh, and the earbuds that come with the camera/mp3 player/hunk-o-junk are HUUUUGE. They aren't comfortable in the least and the cord is too short. I had the camera in my pocket and when I stood erect, the earphones were violently yanked from my ears. They're obviously intended for Oompa-Loompas. ---  --- I'm sure I could have found more problems with this thing, but it eventually died on me for no reason. ---  --- Don't waste your time with this. You will be sorely disappointed. In fact, if I could give this product a rating of-10 stars I would do so. I'm so extremely disappointed with this camera
I ordered this for a friend, thinking it was the same Bruce Fisher book I bought when I divorced.  It is ONLY the workbook and really needs a workshop (or maybe just a book) to go with it.  It was a total waste of money and not what I expected when I ordered.  Make sure you are ordering the book, not the workbook, when you order
I will never make home-made gumbo again, this is so easy and good. 30 minutes and you have great gumbo.
i did not pay head to the other reveiws, and bought this bike anyway.  the first day i had it, the back fender snapped off, leaving sharp points exposed.  sadly, we had to tell our 4 year old, on his birthday, that he could not ride the bike.  so we returned it and got another one.  not more than 30 mins after getting on the new one, than the "exhaust pipes" came off, leaving a VERY sharp screw exposed, then the tire came off and the rim broke, becuase it was plastic as well. also, the vinyl on the seat started to come apart.   ---  --- at this point, i had to return it, and fight to get my money back!!  it was a week after it had been delivered to the house.  i was to afraid that my kids would get hurt on this peice of junk. ---  --- please do not endanger your children by purchasing this bike!
I've tried several different cranberries and these are by far the best on the market.  I received these today and had another brand available to taste test/compare.  The ingredients listed on each package were the same but Bob's has fewer calories and a much sweeter taste.  The berries do cost a little more but they are worth every penny.   --- The following recipe is great: ---  --- 1/2 cup Bob's Red Mill Extra Thick Rolled Oats (Only brand I use) --- 1 Cup 100% Juice Apple Cider  --- 1-2 Tablespoons dried cranberries --- Brown Sugar to taste ---  --- Cook Oatmeal, Apple Cider & Cranberries in microwave approximately 5 minutes.  Add brown sugar, stir & allow to sit 2-3 minutes.  Add additional cider after cooking if you like a thinner oatmeal.  If only Amazon sold Bob's Rolled Oats.....
Great nutrition profile for the calories involved. The different textures make for a healthy ORGANIC snack
I bought this little phone 8 months ago and am truly pleased with it.  I don't use it every day, or even every week.  I got it to keep with me when I'm driving and for those inevitable times when something goes wrong and you need a phone right now.  It has paid me more in peace of mind than it could ever cost in dollars.  What I like about the phone itself is that it is very small and light and can be easily tucked inside pockets or small bags.  It charges fully in a very short time, under two hours the first time out of the box and in under an hour after that.  It holds that charge for a very long time as I just found out recently. Driving to an appointment I was running late and needed to call to let them know.  I'd forgotten to recharge the phone for over 2 months and expected it to be dead as a doornail.  To my delight it turned right on and I made the call with no problems.  Can't beat that.  The Virgin prepay plan is perfect for users like me and ends up costing about $6 a month.  Tell me there's something better and I'll say prove it.  I looked long and hard to find the best possibility and this was it.  I think it still is.  For a nice, dependable "insurance" type phone, I couldn't be more pleased and genuinely recommend it.
My 21 month old toddler loved the star crayon, and so did I initially.  However, during its first use the red crayon fell out of the plastic holder.  The problem is the shape of the crayon is like a round piece of candy.  My son picked it up and was about to put it in his mouth when I saw what had happened.  Personally, I would not use the product given the choking hazard that it presented.  Otherwise, I would use it with care and watch your child carefully as they play with the product. 
I love how many people like to say that Lawrence Walsh was a Republican. Funny. He was an Eisenhower Republican WORLDS REMOVED from the conservative movement. And let's face it: he stink bombed George H.W. Bush at the end of the 1992 campaign when Bush was gaining ground on Clinton. I'm not saying Bush would have won if Walsh hadn't indicted Caspar Weinberger on the Friday before the election, but Walsh made a next-to-impossible task unattainable for Bush. Bush got him back, of course, by pardoning Weinberger on Christmas Eve, 1992. ---  --- The beginning of the book was interesting to say the least. As it wore on, however, it became a prosecutor hoping to go down in history whining about Republicans. Let's face it: people in power tend to be corrupt. They have protection the rest of us don't have. This wasn't just true about Reagan and Bush; it's true about Clinton and whoever you wish to name. About halfway through the book, Walsh concentrates his fire on the guy who was VP at the time, GHW Bush. ---  --- I also find the fact it was endorsed by a number of liberals interesting to say the least. I guess when you can't beat a guy at the ballot box, you impeach him or at least try to. ---  --- Right? ---  --- Not worth the investment of time or money - but does have some good historical information inside.
I've been having trouble finding Avery 3297 Dark T-Shirt transfers in any local store.  For some peculiar reason Staples and Office Depot carry many packets of the Light fabric transfers, which are worthless (they fall apart after the slightest use and the colors run when washed), but never more than 3 or 4 of the really terrific Dark fabric transfers. ---  --- I can't give enough praise for these heavier plastic, opaque transfers for dark colors, and use them regardless of the color of fabric.  As a military veteran and political activist, I use them for peace rallies and marches, and have made flags, banners, shoulder and cap patches--even an occasional T-shirt!  Highly recommend them, but where are they in the stores?  Some managers tell me they were cleaned out during the Christmas season, and I now suspect that the recent store stock has been bought up by other political activists getting reading for our rally and march in Washington DC on Jan 27.  If you're an activist, think about how YOU can use them. ---  --- PS:  I always hand-wash all my finished products in cool or lukewarm water, and have had no problems with colors running.  Just be sure the design is thoroughly ironed on!
i was JUST LOOKING at tennis rackets, on the amazon site. the next thing i get is an email to say i have agreed to purchase one. --- i did NOT press to conferm this order, but AMAZON kept my credit card details on record and used them. --- nicola bradle
Would have been better if I actually got this.. I ordered this and got 6 Dr. Bronner's Lavender soap with a Hemp Tree soap bar code on the back. I'm too lazy to send back and I already opened one And the lavender is nice. But I would rather have the hemp tree... afraid to order again
First of all I am in my early 20's so I haven't much experience in night creams.  I just more recently took an interest in moisturizers and eye creams after I decided to quit tanning and rather preserve my youthfulness.  I use "moisture therapy cream" by Olay in the morning before I put on my makeup, and then I use this at night.  My skin always feels so soft, more soft than I think it ever did.  I can't give any testaments on its firming or anti-wrinkle ability, but I can say it does make my skin glow and my complexion look healthier.  The scent is great and it is a great smell to fall asleep to. ---  --- I would recommend this product to anyone of any age.  It has a good price compared to everything else on the market and I believe it is best to start moisturizing when you are young rather than waiting until the signs of aging have already begun.  Prevention is key
Apparently she has loaded this stroller down with dolls, purses etc and has not let it out of her sight since it was delivered (on time incidentially!)
I loved this camera but I have had to send it back 3 times for the infamous "system error 2" design fault which plagues many of these.  The repair service is slow - the camera has been in repair 50% of the year I have had it
This is my 3rd of this type of mop. I only replace them because eventually something rusts out, so I recommend getting maybe one replacement mop head. What I like best is that it dries in minutes since it basically soaks all the water back up. I won't use any other kind after this and am reminded of how dismal other mops are when I visiting others. We have fake hardwood floors, terrazzo, and ceramic tile and it's great on all of them. The one improvement I would like to see is a wider mop head so I can cover more area faster.  --- Buy this mop!  This seller order time to ship receipt was about 7 days to FL.
So cheap, the seams weren't sewn up all the way.  Am returning
I thought this would be great for the size. The changing pad is just a very thin piece of plastic.  It provides no padding at all. The case itself is padded.  Why didn't they use the padding on the changing "pad" instead of the case? Very uncomfortable for baby. (It is basically like laying out a piece of paper.)I'd rather use those small padded things that come with most diaper bags
Raglan and cap sleeve makes it more edgy than wearing a plain old t-shirt. Good quality for the price.  I usually wear a medium but ordered the XL and it's a good fit (fitted but not too tight)
The directions for this product were userfriendly which made the calibrations easy to set up. However, at times the product is very sensitive and reacts to any kind of movement (i.e. driving to work...??) Therefore, for the most part,  its very efficient and the benefits of knowing how many steps I take each day has been invaluable.
TOO BAD THERE WASN'T A RATING OF 0 STAR. THIS IS THE WORST PIECE OF JUNK I EVER BOUGHT. FIRST OF ALL WE WERE LOOKING FOR A BRAND CALLED SPORTS AFIELD. THIS ITEM FELL UNDER IT WHEN WE DID A SEARCH. WHEN IT ARRIVED IT WAS SOME OFF THE WALL BRAND.THEY WERE PAPER THIN BUT  THOUGHT MAYBE THEY WERE WARM BEING IT WAS FROM AN ARMY AND NAVY STORE. WRONG!!!!!!! THEY SERVED NO PURPOSE AT ALL.WERE NOT WARM AT ALL. .WE WASHED THEM PER DIRECTIOS ON TAG AND SHRUNK SO BAD I DON'T THINK A 2 YR OLD COULD FIT IN THEM.DO NOT BUY!!!!!!JUN
A friend who knows my taste in music recommended VNV Nation to me, so I got Matter + Form based on the reviews.  In one sense I like it.  The production is excellent and I find every track to be creative and unique.  But I HATE the vocals and so I can't bear to listen to the CD.  This dude has the worst voice in music history. 
I have used D'Addario strings exclusively for the last 20 years. I can tell you from comparison that they are much louder and fuller than GHS Boomers in the same guage and more reliable than whatever might come stock on a new guitar. --- There may be other brands out there that might give you more of a lifespan but at the comprimise of tone. They do tend to get grungy after a weekend's gig, but if you change strings regularly I have yet to find a string that doesn't dissapoint compared to D'Addario...plus you can save the empty packs and send them in for cool stuff
Exactly what I wanted... works perfectly... The flosser at the bottom the head of the toothbrush is great at getting between the teeth.  Charges quickly and is convien
This chocolate was great - the first time I used a fondue fountain I used chocolate chips - I had no idea you have to melt it beforehand in a pot, then add oil to it in order to use it - I ended up adding too much oil and ruined the whole thing - then someone told me about using liquid chocolate - it was so much easier you just have to pour it in.  And the taste was amazing - if I didnt find this I probably would never have used my fountain again..
I didn't read in the instructions that I was also buying a dancing partner.  This thing just *will not* stay still.  I tried putting it on carpet and on wood floors, but the water weight just isn't enough to keep it still.  Power punching causes the base to tip and then slam back to the floor making a terrible racket.  If I lived in an apartment, my neighbors would hate me.   ---  --- The water ends up around 200lbs (when full) and just doesn't do the trick.  I have been thinking of using sand which tops out around 320lbs, but not sure how easy it will be to get back out since the only opening is a small opening on top meant for water. ---  --- As for springiness, you can definitely wail on this thing and it can take it (by moving across the floor), but in my opinion it's TOO springy.  There is no comparison to hitting a hanging bag.  It definitely needs a tension adjustment. ---  --- I'd say this bag is probably better for practicing control.  I wouldn't suggest this for an apartment if you plan on power-hitting
I was looking for an intructional CD to help my daughter to learn chess.  I read the reviews and endorsements and thought that this was what I was looking for.  WRONG! ---  --- First of all, the CD comes with no instruction book and you're left to try and figure out what you're supposed to do by yourself (good luck). I've spent over 2 hours on this thing so far and I still haven't seen one thing that would help my daughter to learn to play chess. ---  --- I've emailed their 'help line' hoping to get some answers and never heard back from them. ---  --- Save your money and your sanity and don't buy this CD.
i was charged the full price of 49.95 with no $20 coupon inserted
First of al it is not stainless steel. It has exactly its price do not think it is too cheap...Handle is not that reliable it is like it's gonna break easily I mean don't think of any usage. It is only for decoration.
Dilvered quickly in time for Christmas. Sweatshirt was great quality
THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS is Wes Anderson's third major motion picture.  The movie revolves around a rich, but extremely eccentric man name Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman).  Royal and his wife Etheline (Angelica Huston) had three children:  Chas (Ben Stiller), Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow), and Richie (Luke Wilson).  In the 1970s the Tenenbaums were one of America's premier families:  Margot was a famous playwright, Richie was a junior tennis champion who later won three consecutive U.S. Nationals, and Chas started his first real estate business at an early age earning himself his first million dollars before he was thirteen.  That was almost thirty years ago and the Tenenbaums have largely been forgotten.  Betrayal, failure, and disaster have haunted the family and the laurels of their youthful days have withered and died.  What's worse is that Royal's children and wife blame him for all their failures.  Royal senses that his time is Earth is waning and he wishes to set things right.  With the assistance of his faithful servant and lifelong friend, Pagoda (Kumar Pallana), Royal sets into motion a plan to redeem himself in his family's eyes. ---  --- I'm a pretty big fan of Wes Anderson and have seen all four of his films.  THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS is Anderson's most critically acclaimed and his most popular picture.  However, it is my least favorite of his movies.  Like all Anderson films the movie is filled with quirky characters and witty dialogue.  The film is about the redemption of a man in the eyes of his family, a theme that I enjoy.  Yet, the film just didn't resonate with me as much as Anderson's other pictures.  I really don't know why that is.  That's not to say THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS is a bad movie because it's not.  In addition to everything else mention it also has some good acting, brilliant set designs, etc.  I just prefer a movie about thieve brothers or a film about a precocious teenage genius or comic-drama about a sea-voyaging documentarian instead
 Ok let me break itdown for you. The Game isn't all thatb great, infact it sucks on ice, but the only reason i am giving this game fear grade is because of the year. Really you really can't blame them that made this game. The Fact Is 2006 is one of the worst years. there just throwing all the game at your face and they arent really that great. we see about 90% of games and movies arent doing that good. so my suchest is wait to 2007 when the PS3 and the wii comes out. I Promise you that year want disoponte. So dont buy every thing in 06, wait till 07. Dont waiste your mone
This is one awesome tool I was able to save big on this scanner; this is a tool that pays for itself. I was able to troubleshoot two of my co-workers vehicle without charging them, one was a BMW & the other one was a Lincoln town's car the next time everyone got to pay the piper. It definitely pinpoints the actual fault code. I had it for about 6 month; I just started to use it. I even found the problem with my 1988 Buick OBD I It's an amazing product. It has all the attachments for OBD II & I, which enables one to get the job done without, having those dealers & shop ripping you off. If you did take it to the shop after scanning your vehicle, you can definitely intimidate those dealership by representing your fault to them. Being that they know what your talking about, they will not tend to make markups suggestion to you, if you know what I mean
Anyone who reads this book would not be surprised at the runaway success of the "Left Behind" series, since it demonstrates that a preoccupation with Bible prophecy affects a much wider demographic than the fundamentalist subculture. Indeed, the impact of premillenial thought has extended all the way up to the Reagan White House. And, Christian or not, who hasn't heard of the term "Antichrist" or the significance of the number "666"? This book presents a fairly comprehensive survey of popular eschatology, including the role of Israel, Russia, the Arab countries, Europe, and the United States. It also shows how those beliefs have changed over the years (Turkey was considered Gog and Magog before Russia was, and the Pope was designated as the Antichrist for years before Hitler and Henry Kissinger came along). The final chapter, written at the brink of the collapse of the Soviet Union, demonstrates how, once again, premillenial thought adjusts itself (or sometimes not) depending upon world conditions. This is a fair, even-handed treatment of a religious and cultural phenomenon
Don't know about anyone else, but the DVD I purchased had lousy video.  The only good shots were of closeups and sometimes it took the cameraman a few seconds to focus on a number of the shots. All of the long distance shots were grainy and not clear and the medium range shots were not good either. I know the concert was indoors, but I've seen other indoor videos that did not have this problem.  Did I get a bad DVD or did anyone else have this problem
I received a lovely pendant necklace several years ago, and wear it everywhere, but my long hair always tangles in the chain and trying to get the hair out usually breaks the chain.  I average buying about 4 new chains a year.  Since purchasing this chain, my hair is not tangled nor ripped out by the links, clothing fiber doesn't catch on it, my pendant does not get stuck on the clasp-in short, this is the worlds most perfect chain!  I cannot tell you how happy I am with this purchase
There is NO way my daughter will be able to get through this gate. She is the most rambunctious little girl too. And she is only 10 months old. She is already running around and able to walk really well on her own. And she loves the stairs. This gate is perfect in front of our stairs and they're not even with the wall either. The banaster and the very top stair are totally uneven and our opening is about 7 feet wide. And with the Configure Gate and one extension, there is no way I will ever have to worry about my daughter falling down the staris or breaking our gates, which she has done due to the way the top of our stairs are. This is the only gate that I have found that works perfect for our home. Plus the door in the gate is easy to use. You don't have to squeeze hard on the handle to open it, but it's not easy enough for a 4 year old to squeeze the handle. I love that this is a heavy-duty metal gate, it won't break or fall apart on me and it was easy to install. I'm so happy that my husband and I bought this gate. It is an all around Great Investment. If you are considering buying a baby gate, you should really invest in a great baby gate. And I HIGHLY recommend this gate. And with the extensions it can fit ANYWHERE in your home or you can make it into a circle for a play yard. If you want a gate for your home, and you want one that will last and protect your child no matter how hard they are on it, get this gate
It's really taste good and let you feel good too. It's a easy way to get calcium. Only concern is the price is little expensive and can't affort to have it often
You have to repeatedly tug at this thing to get it to retract.  The wire is very thin, so I'm thinking it will not last long
...and not just a half-baked product placement tool. BioWare's decision to make the game pre-date the movies was a great one because it gave them considerable creative freedom, even within the confines of the Star Wars brand. ---  --- The biggest reason why KOTOR won over 40 game-of-the-year awards (yes, over 40) is not because you get to swing a double-bladed lightsaber around and use Force powers; it's because of the story! A strong plot is crucial for every RPG, and KOTOR doesn't disappoint. This plot of course includes one of the biggest twists in video game history (all you fans out there know what I'm talking about! If you don't, then go out and buy this game now). ---  --- The game's principal characters, while somewhat stereotypical (i.e. Bastila is the condescending socialite snob, Carth is the tough loner with a troubled past, etc), work very well together and have good chemistry, including with you, the created character. For example, if you play as a female character, it soon becomes obvious that Carth develops feelings for you, but he feels slightly guilty because he lost his wife not too long ago. You'll also find yourself acting as mediator when some of your allies don't get along with each other, i.e. Canderous and Carth, because they fought on opposite sides in the Mandalorian Wars that took place five years before. And aside from the character development, the game feels very rich in its "Star Wars-ness" -- for example, some of the names that BioWare came up with for the planets and people feel and sound like George Lucas himself approved them. ---  --- Despite what I said earlier in this review, cutting down your enemies with a lightsaber and looking good doing it has got to be one of the joys of KOTOR. I admit that when I first got to Dantooine and was on the verge of becoming a Jedi, I was trembling at excitement that I was going to build my own lightsaber, as I wondered what color I was going to choose. ---  --- Having said all that, there are some things that keep this game from getting 5 stars. I felt the game was a bit linear (being able to choose your planets in any order only gives the ILLUSION of open-ended gameplay). I was hoping that the storyline would be different depending on whether I decide to be evil or good, but everything plays the same, save a few minor events and certain conversations. Also, there is a "doorway bug" that causes you to sometimes get stuck when moving through a doorway or narrow corridors. When this happens you can wiggle the thumbstick and free yourself; I've never had any real problems with this bug, but it can get distracting. Also I found moving around in the menu screens to be problematic; you press start to go to the main menu, then you pull the trigger buttons to move between the screens, but often I have to pull the trigger multiple times before the game responds. Also, I'm sure many people would agree that the game's graphics are not up to Xbox standards; even the PS2 is capable of doing better! I don't usually gripe about graphics, but the textures on some background buildings on Taris are downright laughable. ---  --- Overall, I have to give BioWare serious Kudos for taking on a daunting task like creating a new Star Wars game, and I sing their eternal praises for actually making it fun. It is not a stretch to say that I bought an Xbox just to play KOTOR (and a few other titles, but that's another story), and I'm glad I made the investment. Hey, stop reading this and go play
I can't speak to how well the product performs because mine was DOA.  Customer Service was unable to do anything over the phone.  Since it was purchased as a gift and I had time before Christmas, I opted for a different brand.  Doesn't inspire confidence in their quality control when a unit fails to start up fresh out of the box
i bought this candy and when i tasted it it tasted so good.So its the best candy but it hurts your teeth When you eat But this is good and addicting cand
I was also discouraged by the reviews but bought it anyway. It was a lot of fun! While it worked. We experienced the same symptoms as the other reviewers here ... I appreciate the info on how to fix it but should we have to? It's too bad because it really is a cute toy and my 2 year old loved it. I would not buy it again. If you are considering purchasing this toy make sure the company has fixed it first
Big publication.  Little unique coverage.  The mag is very repetitive and lacking.  Almost no womens coverage.  Gee, are they not very hard working cycling athletes as well?  The same big name riders are always mentioned.  Definetly a US publication, not covering an international sport.  May have done more harm than good to cycling with the covers and article structure in 2005 having a lopsided, somewhat sensationalized, view of the doping issue.  I wouldn't subscribe again.  There are too many other good to excellent choices available
I purchased this item as a present for my friend and I. The piece is beautiful and is a great gift for anyone. I myself have the Yin half of the duo. The only problem is that the black paint in the Yin half is easily washed away. Now I don't mean that it all washes away but it does erode. The Yin looks a lot better with a little silver shining through the paint, however, but I do worry about all of the paint eventually going away. Other than that minor defect the necklaces are wonderfull. I'll definately be buying from this seller again
I like this product, but am not sure it is worth the money. I have bought other products for $5 at my local store and I seem to have similar results
I purchased the scarlett version of this bag more than two years ago, and it's still in perfect condition!  The color doesn't fade when you wash it, and it's the most durable bag I've ever owned.  I will not, refuse to, absolutely cannot make me carry a purse, but I carry this bag everyday.  The very front zipper pocket is great for change, the small zipper holds my keys and cell and a host of other small items I always seemed to be losing before, and the large pocket is big enough to fit several medium sized paperbacks in.  It's perfect for everyday use, and will last forever. The "backpack straps" are comfortable and have never broken.  I was so excited when I found this on Amazon, and IN EVERY COLOR!  Before, the selection was red and black only, so this is fabulous!  Buy this bag, you will love it
VERY weak, in fact it was the last hope I had for my machine, which I am selling next week in a yard sale.  It was the color of tea.  Very bad. 
This is the first time I've ordered shoes without trying them on, but these shoes were exactly what I was looking for and couldn't find in the department stores in my size.  I know the name Naturalizer so knew they would be good quality.  They fit perfect, and the price was right! Thank you Amazon
Muy pero muy bueno, es mejor todavia que el primer dvd que salio de esta gira
I ordered my unit directly from Jewel Jet. Aside from receiving the unit in a box that was severely damaged as it was drop shipped in its own box,  I have no complaints with it working as advertised. The unit is quite large so you may not want to leave on the counter but the results are SPECTACULAR. It definitely out cleans my Sonic Cleaner.  I have not been able to see a difference between this and the results after I get my jewelry steamed at a large retailer like Fortunoff. I first used it on a G Color VS stones, but it has caused me to start pulling out pieces of lesser quality that I have not worn in ages to give them a revitalizing breath of "fresh steam" and I still label the results as SPECTACULAR. I love that I am achieivng these great results with just adding tap water. With my own experimenting, I honestly couldn't tell a difference when using after precleaning pieces in a detergent solution as a competing model - that uses BOTH detergent and distilled water - claims
These cherries are awesome, my whole family loves them. We lived in Germany for 3 years and to find a place state side to order these from is great we order alot of them beucase they sure go fast
Sorry to give such a bad review but I can't in good conscience give a better one. I did this workout one time with the 8 lb. ball and have not been able to do any kind of exercise since. I am entering my second week of taking pain killers for my messed-up lower back. There are several segments (including ab work) where the ball is held with straight arms and moved from the down position to up over the head as well as twisting side-to-side. While doing these moves, I kept thinking that they really did not seem sound for that much weight. Sure enough by that evening I was dying! Perhaps they'd be ok if you used the lightest weight ball. I am in good shape and have actually been doing the P90X extreme workouts. I am accustomed to using 20-40 lb. weights and do Tae Kwon Do and I do not have any back problems. I snatched this up when I finally found it for a good price and did it on an off day. Just be forewarned-it is really easy to hurt your back with this workout. I LOVE ALL the other Firm workouts but will never do this one again. Additionally, when I received this from Amazon the ball was misshapen & the DVD case was broken from the weight of the ball. They immediately sent a replacement which was damaged in exactly the same way
We have 3 of them and have no complaints. I keep one in my car, one in my husbands, and have another for travel.  It's super easy to snap the carrier onto it, and very easy to install in any car.  I just travelled for 2 weeks with my 3 month old, and had no problem installing the base into rental cars and other family members cars. I could use the latch, or just use the seatbelt for older cars.  I was worried that I would need my husband's help with the installation, but I was fine on my own just reading the directions. I recommend this for everyone
This is not a usable sword. This is for fans of the movie and to hang on the wall. There are very few swords that can be used, among these are Paul Chen's, Cold Steel's and the Last Legend stuff. Only buy this if you intend to put it on your wall because failure is not a possability it is guaranteed if you try to use this blade
I had very high hopes for this cream, as it appears they went the extra mile for quality. Not so. The cream when used leaves alot of friction as the razor goes over your face, making for some tense moments that should not be there. --- I have used many creams. So far Art of Shaving is the best. Casswell Massey is ok as is Aveda. Avoid Truefitt. ---  --- Update.  --- Trufitt and Hill accepted the return and we spoke about the problems. They sent me a new updated extra fine version that should be available to the public now that is of the same quality as Massey. It is good. The standard is still substandard
The product was unsatisfactory because of how large it was.  My son exchanged it
This DVD contains all of the original Ben Stiller Show episodes, plus an extra un-aired episode. The show was not only far ahead of its time, but also timeless as is evidenced by Stiller's subsequent successful movie roles that drew from many of the characters from the TV series. For anyone who was a fan of the TV series or Stiller's movies, this DVD is a must
I purchased this book several months ago. During that time I've tried several of the recipes - the French Lentil soup is very good. The chili and corn biscuit casserole was unappetizing. The chili was so-so and the corn biscuits were too heavy to my taste. The recipe for Mushroom, French Lentil and Chestnut Ragu says to "see Glossary" for the chestnuts but there's nothing in the glossary regarding chestnuts. It wasn't until I read another recipe (Smoky Chestnut and Sweet Potato soup) that chestnuts were discussed. The Mediterranean Salad sounds good on paper but was lackluster. Far too much red onion (which my guests mostly picked out). Although a number of the recipes are relatively simple there are several with very long lists of ingredients that take too much time and too many utensils to prepare. As someone who works full time, a 20-ingredient recipe holds very little allure, no matter how good it sounds. I had trouble finding some of the ingredients. For example, the author specifies several different types of squash which I haven't been able to locate at any of my local grocery stores or farmer's markets.  The book is organized in menus which are not listed in the table of contents. If you're looking for a specific recipe you'll have to spend some time with the index trying to locate it which is not convenient. The author definitely has some good ideas but this book probably will sit on my bookshelf more than on my countertop
This movie is NOT for you if you cannot handle movies just being flat out weird.  Sure, there are plenty of plot holes, Reeves is in it so don't expect an academy award.....however the plot is very interesting (again filled with tons of holes) but I watch a movie to be entertained, not to be a film critic or to analyze everything. ---  --- Overall, if you like weird movies like "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" this movie is for you, if not and you like to be a nerd about movies and analyze every little detail about how "true to life" it may or may not be.....well just skip this one
I have started taking this supplement a month ago and I feel my hair is stronger than ever. Also my hair loss has became minimal! --- Besides that, my nails are harder, I love it
I had, repeat had been reading this magazine for ten years or so. Over that time they have really changed. I guess it started when they got a new editor four or five years ago. After that the adds changed from building suppliers to lexus ads. I don't like seeing automotive and home stereo ads in my how-to magazine. The information is more akin to Martha Stewart than it is Norm Abrams. Who by the way is hardly in there anymore if at all. Not to mention the new guy, A stray they picked up from ask this old house, what an opie taylor he is. What makes him eligible to write something for TOH magazine. I really miss Steve Thomas. The how-to's though somewhat informative really lack the intricate details. All I can say is thank god Tom Silva still puts in some minutia of his wealth of information. If you'd like a "Better Homes and Gardens plus magazine" then this magazines for you if you want to learn something try Fine Homebuilding or at the least Family Handyman
Heard other poster said v10 has been available, so searched and found it is true. V10 is available at the maker's web site at the same price as that of v9 sold here.  BTW, I planed but haven't buy the product yet. But I have to assign a star number in order to post this message
I got this for Cyber Monday for $20 too.  I thought I couldn't go wrong for $20.  Well, I was wrong--it was twenty dollars completely wasted.  I'd feel bad giving this POS away...  I could not get the thing to stay put, the boom mike is so bottom-heavy that it won't stay close to my cheek even sitting still!  And it pokes out about 3 feet to the side of my head (it seems like it anyway) if I am moving around at all!  Almost like it was DESIGNED to get as far away from my voice as possible.  But even holding the stupid thing with my hand did not help the sound quality.  I got constant complaints that I could not be heard very well. ---  --- There are only a couple things saving this from a 1 star rating.  First, I did only pay $20 for it.  Second, it's a decent quality, just piss-poor design.  And three, I liked that when I clicked the button (not due to incoming call), it automatically launched the voice dial menu, so I could really make a call without ever touching my cell phone.  I guess that is one of the perks of having the same mfr for both headset and phone. But it fails miserably at it's primary design goal, so I heartily recommend staying away from this product
Bigger and more luscious than any other available dried blueberries.  They make a huge difference and are worth the extra price.  I substitute them for the raisins in our favorite Quaker Oatmeal cookie recipe and everyone loves the results.  Hope the oatmeal and blueberry health benefits cancel the butter/sugar calories!   
Top of the line (April 2005) D-cell NiMH batteries have 11,000 mAh compared to this one 2,200 mAh (they cost 16 bucks but 10,000 mAh battery costs six bucks). Top of the line AA NiMH batteries have capacity of 2500 mAh. Top of the line NiCad D-Cell batteries have 5000 mAh capacity (costs around five bucks). I thought that NiMH was more capable than NiCad. True, but not in this case. ---  --- So what are we gettting here? Higher AA battery capacity in D-cell case. This battery is overpriced for what it delivers.
Phil Jackson groupie and sometime ESPN.com writer Charley Rosen turns in a fun, but sometimes off-putting fictionalized account of minor league basketball life.  He develops the characters well and puts forth a decent plot.  However, Rosen's personal oddities drag the book down.  Rosen is absolutely obsessed with bodily functions and he repeatedly goes into way too much detail about farting, urination, defacation, etc.  At times, the book reads like an immature third grader's delight.  My roommates and I all read it and the general consensus was that the book was enjoyable, but Charley Rosen is a really weird guy
I can't believe this application. I bought it last year and I have 200 pages completed. I can truthfully say that I will never scrapbook the traditional way from this moment on. So fast and easy! I will be all up to date with my scrap booking for X-MAS '05. I am overjoyed. I don't believe I know anyone who scrapbooks traditionally anymore! Thanks for simplifying my life
Wow guys... How many of you are on crack? --- Ive given this album 2 whole listens an it still sucks ass. Besides if I should have to listen to something more than a few times to know its hot then its wack. Cause if you listen to ANYTHING enough you will like it. It's human nature... --- Keith, ummm... Excuse me " Dr. Octagon " is a retard, mentalcase, and has no lyrical ability. Half of you people like this just cause its so different. What he says makes no sence, and has no meaning. That which he does say that does make sence is nasty, and weak. His flow is awefull. His delivery is AWEFULLL. Automator does a good job on the boards making nice beats, but Keiths lame ass f***s up good beats... --- Feel free to click that you dont agree with this Kool Keith d***riders. :
I read many positive reviews on Pure Grace and decided to try it since I love a fresh, clean scent.  I was very disapointed when I used it, as it reminded me of Jean nate, which to me is an old lady smell.  It was more musky than clean smelling.  I couldn't smell any hint of feminine sweetness or floweriness to it.  It smelled like scented musky water with a sesemee oil...that is the only way I can describe it
We used the small size until our daughter was too long for it (around 3 months old) and switched to the large size.  She still loves it and is sleeping great (3 day naps and 10-11 hours uninterrupted sleep at night)!  It is part of her naptime/bedtime routine and it travels with us so she can get good sleep in a familiar environment wherever we are.  The velcro has been a lifesaver and the microfleece helps her stay warm but not overheated. 
The Kermis is bad-to-the-bone fast. This is not a bike for the average 'fred'. The Kermis is super stiff and fast and handles high and tight. There is an element of stability on climbis & descents too, as the bike is a flat-out roadster. I'm thinking of naming my first pet or kid Kermis in hommage to this great road machine
I am the type of person who has to have a watch on; I feel lost without it.  Therefore, my watch has to be something that I can wear every day.  But I also wanted something that can go with a dressier outfit.  And this watch is wonderful.  I've heard that Skagen is a good brand and it's true.  It's very lightweight, beautiful (I love the little crystals at each number), and durable.  Great buy
The title pretty much says it all.  The bag is solid and didn't get too soft even after a good amount of use.  The big downside is that the metal clasps that are used to hang up the bag are of extremely poor quality and can't support the weight of the bag. One of the clasps actually broke in two and two of the others became bent beyond usability.  All within about six months of use.  Unless you're prepared to spot weld the clasps to reinforce them I'd look elsewhere for a heavy bag. 
Needed the adapter to charge my Shuffle, since the AC adapter I have is one of those older Apple ones with the Firewire connector. Suits my needs perfectly. ---  --- No experience with any sound docks, however, so I can't comment on the performance flaws other people have brought up
When I first purchase this album the first time.  It was Exceptional then and it still is .  Exceptional and Gifted Group these Ladies rule the early 90's.  Some of my favorites Free Your Mind, My Lovin, It Ain't Over till the Fat Lady Sings, just to name a few.  Envogues voices all of them work masterfully together they way a head of their time.  As far as female groups they rank 5 stars in my book following such groups as Supremes, Labelle, TLC the had allot orginiality and appeal that drew people to them because of the voices and their orignal material.  They are trendsetters. --- Please go buy this CD.  I will buy it again myself.  I have the cassette. I need the CD for my collection.  I know they came out with a new album hopefully this will be a Great album as well. ---  --- Go Envogue G
We have Kid Pix 3 and my kids (4 & 6) played it all the time. We just "upgraded" to Kid Pix 4, and my initial experience has prompted me to write this warning. ---  --- Kid Pix 4 runs in 800x600 resolution BUT it won't force your screen resolution to match that when it runs. Kid Pix 3, of course, did. As we are using a LCD monitor with native resolution of 1280 x 1024, we obviously want to keep the desktop running in this resolution. So now we are faced with 2 options: 1) Use Kid Pix 4 with a drastically reduced window (the drawing and toolbars are in a box surrounded by a huge black screen with the file menus at the very top) or 2) adjust the resolution manually every time someone wants to run or exit the program. ---  --- I find this unacceptable. Customer support is non-existent: if you bought it retail, The Learning Company won't answer your questions and refers you to Encore's website. No patches are available and Encore has no way to actually contact them. Their FAQ simply explains how to go to your desktop and adjust your screen resolution to 800x600. ---  --- I think this huge oversight and lack of any patch to simply fix the problem speaks volumes for the quality of this release. ---  --- Boo to Encore, boo to TLC for allowing their "brand" to be junked, boo to Broderbund. Don't waste your time
A great magazine that keeps getting better as time goes on. I have watched it from the start and have continued to be impressed by Editor Jason Sizemore's growing tome to the darker side of Sci-Fi. With solid Interviews and strong fiction by established pros like William F. Nolan, Ben Bova, Tom Piccirilli, Neil Gaiman and Brian Keene and talented newcomers like Bryn Sparks, Jenifer Pelland, and Eugie Foster you can't miss with this one
Peter Dinklage may be the one of the most unlikely sex symbols ever to assay the role of A Stranger Comes To Town, but that's part of what makes this charming character study so offbeat and unforgettable.  As Finn, a dwarf who has just inherited an abandoned train station in Newfoundland, NJ, Dinklage carries the story on his small but exceptionally sturdy back, never begging the audience's sympathy but conveying worlds of anger, hurt, bewilderment and amusement in his dark eyes.  (His rumbly, seductive voice doesn't hurt either.)  As a local resident with a tragic past, Patricia Clarkson adds to her litany of complex women characters (and provides some of the film's biggest laughs when behind the wheel of her SUV), with stellar support from a garrulous Bobby Cannavale and a luminous Michelle Williams.  Settle into the film's gracious, generous rhythms and prepare to feel absolutely wonderful
Overdrive, watching the rain, Enchanted, Teaching myself to dream, Glow, Lemon, Because I can are really excellent songs, this album is really worth it.
Don't waste your money on this size. Go ahead and get the 19 x 39 towel. The absorbency is good but there's no way it will fit around a head. Also, I'm not sure what to do with the snap that is attached either
Impressed with the way it clears out viruses, spyware, and Trojans---I can look at what it's doing or just let it do it. That all goes well. What I don't like is it requires a password for everything even my usual automatic sign-me-in sites and I can't figure how to change this. So the instructions are not as specific as would be helpful
Too often in America we are fed news by deceiving journalists (such as those that work for Fox News). The Economist offers news with an agenda that does not always correspond to America's. It is a great resource for furthering ones knowledge of the world, from politics to economics to science to the arts. Best of all, the articles (except for the Special Report) are concise, allowing for an easy read.
Soft leather, attractive look, and very easy to use.  Over-the-top strap easily secures blackberry in place.  Blackberry can easily be slid in and out of the holster.  I purchased this with my brand new blackberry (8703e) and have not observed a single scuff or scratch on the device after numerous times sliding the phone in and out of the holster. ---  --- The only potential negative is the plastic belt clip starts to dig into the side of your abdomen if worn for extended periods of time. ---  --- I would definately recommend this item
I've tried this sling about 4 times with my now 10 week-old son.  I just can't get it to work so that he seems comfortable.  He usually cries when he is in it.  He fell asleep in it once, but he looked so contorted.  It's just so tight against my body that it bends him the wrong way.  And the pocket is so deep it closes over his head. And I know I got the correct size. I've given up and am looking for a better sling.  Right now we use our baby bjorn several times a day, and he loves it, but it's a little cumbersome, and I want him to be able to recline.  
I have had this items before, in fact this is a replacement for one that was mounted on my motor home. the windshield had to be replaced and a new antenna was needed. Works fine, just like the one before. A very eash purchase and fast delivery
I've had it for about a month now and I finally got to use it yesterday.  I was so impressed by how easy it was to use and how fast it worked.  To be honest, I hate dealing with anything under the hood of my car but even in my incapable hands, this thing could not have been any easier to use.  Best of all, it started my car instantly.  I was so proud of myself!  I highly recommend it to anyone.  And as others have mentioned, it has sturdy metal clamps that look like they would very difficult to break.  The whole thing looks solidly built. 
Great for Novelty gifts. But don't give it to true tea lovers!!! Different kinds of flowering Tea look great & very entertaining to watch bloom, but taste pretty crummy. I would say most of them taste somewhere between stale and tasteless.  Nevertheless, it's a nice gift because of the experience, and the cool box & glass pot you get to keep
I have used this flask for about a month now - I absolutely love it! I purchased this based on the reputation of the Bodum brand. I have never had a problem with any kind of leakage or spillage. It has tipped over before with no problems, I highly recommend this for anyone
A Good movie;A John Wayne movie with a very nice cast, the usual Harry Carye Jr.Ben Johnson,John Agar,Paul Fix and many other great people. Especially from the time it is great to see Merlin Olsen and Roman Gabriel from the Football movie actor Era. The added plus is we have Rock Hudson in the movie.Not to forget the movies leading ladies Lee Meriweather,Marian McCargo.The women are very nice looking  and they would be if they were in Rock Hudson's family. The time era of the film is after the American Civil War. John Wayne is your Northerner and Rock is from the South. The deep South. John Wayne is with his loyal men who are finanical ruined after the war and need to take home money to their families when they return.They band together to run a herd legally.The Rock is a family man who has lost everything even his country. The Southerns are lured to Mexico with false promises and high hopes. The Northerners are going to do business with Mexico also.John Wayne and the men end up helping the Southerns. Enemies but John Wayne and his men have honor and help the Southerners.Most importantly fellow Americans. The Civil War tore us apart and threw us together. There are great elements in the movie action,love,honor in people,human weaknesses,saddness,and some historical correctness. The movie is not anyone's best movie but it is not the worse either. Good entertainment with a good mix of plot and history. John Wayne and the Rock's only movie together. The movie shows everyone in such great shape and takes you back to great movie times.Watch and Enjoy
There are no professionals or would-be professional  photographers in our house.  Instead we are ametuers who love to get fun shots of our friends and family.  We're not particularly interested in birds, flowers, bugs, race cars, etc.  We want to catch our kids doing what they love best; football, basketball, swimming, band, golf... ---  --- My only advantage is that I am very experienced with Adobe Photoshop, which lets me creatively salvage some less-than-perfect shots. ---  --- This year our son is a high-school senior.  Instead of buying an expensive portrait package, we voted to spend the money on a Canon Digital Rebel XT kit (with lens).  We choose one extra zoom lense (the 75-300mm f4-5.6 III USM Telephoto) for up-close action sports shots.  We didn't chose the IS lens because it was out of our price range. ---  --- We are having great fun with this camera and lens.  We have already taken a variety of football game pictures using the 'basic' sports setting on the camera (burst mode at full zoom).  They are great - crisp and clear.  These have been taken in full sun.  We realize that we'll have to get a little more creative when we are taking pictures in lower light situations.  But I think we can do it. ---  --- I would recommend this lens for anyone who just wants to capture some fun shots.  They might not be professional quality, but they are just what we wanted
Was not the same boot from the pictures. Got very sad when opend my packet
This subscription is the way to go if you are sick and tired of finding the last copy of Q magazine for sale on the newstands is missing the 'enclosed' CD because some chump has stolen it before you could.  This rock music magazine is superior to others on the market, in my opinion, because it has excellent production values, i.e. luxuriantly thick and glossy paper and high quality reproductions.  As a bonus, the writing is superior and highly imaginative.  An expecial favorite section of mine is the 'man on the streets' section in the back where concert goers are canvassed for their opinions on the show they have just watched.  I like it because the reporter is sure to get a good cross-section of the audience and it clues one in on the reaction different types of people have to the band.  In addition, this magazine covers US and worldwide bands that may not be as well-known here in the USA as they are in UK; often these are bands that we might want to know better.  The reviews section is always great, and usually the magazine will highlight a mini-section e.g. 'Best R&B albums from the 1970's, in which lost gems are rediscovered for the reader who may be too young to remember or even know about these artists.  This magazine will have you finding, buying and liking albums by bands you've never heard of, and who can beat the home delivery aspect for nickels more than the newstand price
You already knew it was a good game becuase it's Final Fantasy, probably the biggest and most popular series in the history of video games. ---  --- This one is probably a little worse than the best Final Fantasy games (such as III and VII) but, despite that, what you have here is a Game Boy Advance RPG that has graphics that actually aren't that bad, and the storyline is pretty good too.  You just can't go wrong with Final Fantasy games. 
We bought this crib online & couldn't be more pleased.  The shipping was great - a few minor nicks but nothing overly noticeable.  The directions aren't bad - but they could be a lot better/clearer.  We also bought the matching change table & it looks great in the baby's room. Net, great value for a great product!
     The best quality sound in mid and treble ranges. Bass some what weak.  Clear, detail  and non distorted tones emerge into the balanced inner stage of the headphone.  No other headphone under a hundred dollars comes close to the sound purity. ---      Biggest flaw is the cord wires easily break creating shorts and loss of one or both sides.  I am on my 3rd pair due to wire breakage.  Repairs by profesionals have not been successful.  If you can afford it buy the extension cord to lower the risk of wire breakage
Nice cover pictures and headlines, but way too many ads.  There's a reason its only twelve bucks, this is an ad-sponsored mag
Do not buy this CD.  He is definitely wack. His silly rhyme style and dull voice sounds lethargic over uninspired beats. As a member of "Children of the Corn" he was weak and he still is weak.  The other member of his Dip-Set Crew outshine him on his own CD...how lame is that.  Through away any Cam'ron cd's you own and immediately replace them with music by Jay-Z. 
I agree with the two previous reviewers.  There needs to be a user manual and there isn't one.  The fine adjustment will adjust the vertical angle maybe 15 degrees.  This isn't very helpful for star gazing.  The maximum height of the tripod is only 45 inches.  This is an uncomfortable height for looking through binoculars while standing. Celestron should have a users guide showing how their tripod and binoculars are supposed to work together
I use a plastic water bottle and the only part that is kept cold is the bottom. 
I purchased this bed online last year.  It looks great and as we all know our daughters love Dora.  However, the bed was a disaster to put together and if your not handy, you would problably give up.  The rods that come with the bed do not stay in the holes, and for a very active 3 year old this bed will not last 3 months. <br /> --- What a waste of money, invest a bed that your child can growth with, and something that will withstand the active lifestyle of the average child
this was a great watch, excellent service.  The order arrived on time and I love the watch
I used TurboTax Premier last year & was so happy with it that I told everyone to buy it this year.  What a fool I was.  This years program was a nightmare.  I will never purchase it again.  Every time I needed to go back to check something, I had to go backwards through each page until I reached the page I wanted.  Then to go forward to where you originally were, you had to retrace all your steps a second or third or fourth time.  It got to the point I quit going back to check.  It took hours this year and I am still not confident the results were correct.  I may take it to H&R Block just to see if I need to file an amend.  Next year I will try a different product.  ---One other thing, navigating the State portion was so difficult.  There were hidden pages in something called "quick zoom" or some such thing.  I could never figure out where I was.  Thanks for the headache Turbotax
Like the MTM show, Newhart has a style of humor that's timeless, and this show seemed to get better with each passing season
Lucas is one of Corey Haim's 80s greatest movies ,I have The DVD,You too gotta Go get it. :)
this is the 2nd SE phone after T637, and this phone is just better --- using it with T-Mobile, it works pretty well as phone and modem --- voice: the strongest part, the best sounding phone I ever used in 6 years, the speakerphone is OK, not so loud --- reception: another strongest part, with T-Mobile, it can get some weak signal when all other don't get signal at all; however, the antenna is located at the top back (where the loop is), touching this part will lose reception --- operation: typical SE style, pretty easy for SE users, 3 dedicated buttons: web, messaging, task --- cam: excellent, even though it doesn't have auto-focus like K750 and K790, it looks pretty good, even it's better than nokia 6270 --- bt: very easy to use and pair, with pc suite installed, file transfer and sync is just a piece of cake, the transfer speed is 300-400kB, this is the maximum of bt 2.0 speed --- screen: the main screen is pretty bright, even I have to set the brightness down, animated standby screen is simply cool; external screen, however, is monochrome (it maybe a plus when using outdoors, the main is barely viewable under sunlight), it display info only, it's a kinda inconveient when doing self-pic --- audio player: I seldom use it because it doesn't support ogg vorbis, which I mainly use, streaming audio supports real only, no shoutcast --- conclusion: this phone is a pretty good phone for the price, quad-band is a must for Cingular users, fast EDGE modem for web and tethering --- score: I give it 95/100, there're some cons --- rare memory card (M2), and it's not hot-pluggable --- lack of ogg vorbis and shoutcast support --- no default USB mode (always asks when plug in, kinda annoying
Boy, the folks at EA really outdone themselves this time.  Just when I thought 2003 was the greatest NCAA ARCADE game ever EA releases NCAA 2006.  This blows 2003 out the water.  I never knew it could be sooo much fun having the CPU complete 80 Yard TD pass every single time.  Nor did I know that the bomb is the most acurate pass in the game.  Who needs realism in a football sim when you can just bomb the ball down field and have it be on target every single time.  This game punishes you for trying to play like a real football game, so why not just bomb it every time.  If your receiver drops a wide open 5 yard pass, that just means he wants you to throw it 60 yards down the field and he'll have a much better chance of catching it. ---  --- Where else can you find a game where QB's constantly break tackles, spin on one foot and throw a perfect spiral 40 yards down the field right on target?  ITS IN THE GAME!! WOW!! ---  --- I love how RB's can break 7 tackles on there way to a 81 yard TD run.   ---  --- Oh yeah those safeties are beasts.  They apparantly have a very strong gravitational pull which causes your TE and OL to completely ignore the D-Linemen and linebackers and run to block the safeties who are not even in the play.  Every safety should be in the NFL if they are able to do that.  WOW! ---  --- Oh and don't forget about the kickers.  Only in an arcade game can a mid 70's rated kickers can drill 50+ yard FGs against the wind with 10 yards to spare every single time.   ---  --- And if you don't believe that this is a great Arcade game, check out the scoring of my latest game!!  Sexton threw 6 picks, yet still had the composure to throw 6 TD passes and for nearly 500 yards on only 13 passes.  WOW, IT REALLY IS IN THE GAME!!!! ---  --- [...
The quality of this swaddle blanket is very good, I'm not complaining about that. The problem we've had with our newborn is that as he squirms the blanket rides up and hits his cheeks.  This triggers his newborn rooting instinct, which makes him search around frantically for a nipple to suck on. Instead of lulling him to sleep it gets him frantic with hunger.  --- I recommend the sleep sac from this same company instead of this item. We own two of them, and they keep our baby very cozy and warm
OK, the original is a classic and is what...90...100 minutes long? Jackson stretches it out to 3 hours and adds very little to the story.  The native were scary. The quiet scenes with Kong were welcome additions, they actually made him into a character...something that can't be said for any of the human characters. ---  --- The insect scenes are ridiculous!! The dinosaur stampede was idiotic. Anything with the young cabin boy almost seemed like it was clipped out of another movie. Now Jackson is adding 38 munutes to a movie that is grossly over padded to begin with?!? ---  --- Peter Jackson is a hack director that has no idea how to tell a story efficiently.Remind me to skip his next 15 3 hour long epics
This gun is really cool! It has decent aim, great fire power, and the charge lasts a long time. The only thing i find a little usettling is the fact that the clip only holds about 20 bb's at a time, but hey, you can't have everything. Anyways, great buy
I bought this item to protect my new Motorola L6.  --- First of all, it's a cheap piece of plastic... would break if dropped. --- Second, and more important, MY PHONE DOESN'T WORK WITH IT ON! The plastic tabs on the side are were the side buttons are on the phone, preventing any usage of the entire phone.  --- BEWARE... DON'T BUY
I bought this for my wife when her Sonicare died. She loves it. Great price. She didn't want the better one and is very happy with it. Her teeth look great and she likes the way they feel after brushing
I bought these for some Sony surround sound speakers, although I was initially concerned about the choice because they are made from what is(essentially) plastic.  However, they turned out to be very sturdy, and easy to install.  I also have to commend the mannufacturer for including very detailed instructions as well as a large selection of mounting hardware.  Well worth the price
Works great ONLY if you have dry dusts. If the dust is wet, or was wet and now dried, it doesn't work. Otherwise, great as a touch up dusting in between washings.
I received the wrong size originally. The company was prompt in sending me another dress, however, I received a third dress which I refused by mail and I am trying to get my credit card adjusted. ---  The dress is lovely
This is the very BEST hairstyler and hair dryer in one! I have very fine, thick, shoulder lenght hair and was a little skeptical that this product would be usefull for me. It is! Actually it is the best hair styling product I have ever purchased. It dries and sets my hair very quickly, usually in five minutes or less. What a timesaver. I am so delighted with this product that I purchased eight (8) to keep in my closet so I don't have to hunt for the best product EVER!!!
The Southwestern Spanish flavor is pleasant but not overpowering, and the rice is fluffy, not "clumpy" like other brands. I always keep a pouch in my car and at the office for when I don't have time to get out for lunch, and in my suitcase for when I need a late night snack while travelling. We always take Viva La Rice when camping, backpacking or boating. This is an excellent product at a very fair price
My husband bought this for the 2nd time after losing the first. It is nice for dressy or casual.  Highly recommended
Good texture, good taste on the Ahi tuna. Almost as good as beef jerky.  ---  --- Avoid the salmon jerky. Most of the strips were hard and brittle. Some were so tough they were barely edible...more fit for my dog. Also the salmon was too spicy
The kids love 'em and what could be better than that?  I bought one box at the local grocery and glad to see they are available here.  We tried the strawberry, frosted, and like other reviewers I agree:  not too sweet, right amount of frosting.  Can't wait to try the next flavor
Do not waste your money!  I consider myself pretty computer savvy, but this software is not easy to use.  You'd have an easier time just drawing out your ideas by hand. 
I have had 5 digital point and shoot cameras all a little bigger and better than the last. This is my first SLR and I am not in the least disappointed. This camera meets or exceeded everything I expected from it. Very easy to learn, read the manual and use the web site tuturial and when the battery is charged your ready to go take pictures. I highly recommend this camera
This character Buckaroo Banzai played by Peter Weller is an incredible individual.  A well accomplished person who is half japanese, brain surgeon, scientist, martial artiste, and rock star.  He also knows how to ride a motorcycle. BB is backed up with a special hand picked team of men known as the" Blue Blazers".  In this episode they battle aliens from Planet 10 across the 8th Dimension.  John Lithgow stars as the demented Dr. Emilio Lizardo in one of his greatest roles.  Blue Blazer Regulars such as Perfect Tommy, Reno, Jersey, Rawhide, and Pinky Caruthers add to the amusement but Pacos is in Tibet. The characters are colorful.  As "another you", Ellen Barkin plays Penny Pretty who safeguards the overthruster.  Flaws with the script would be "Why would Orson Wells be giving the news during Halloween 1938 and changing it to H.G. Wells "War of the Worlds"?  I thought he did fiction like "Citizen Kane" not report news events of the era such as the tragedy of the Hindenburg Disaster for example.  Is Orson Wells related to H.G. Wells or Tom Cruise? The movie is entertaining.  We can see why Peter Weller today stars in documentaries on the History Channel.  I only wish there be re-issues of the "Kids From C.A.P.E.R."(Civilian Authority for the Protection of Everyone Regardless) Television Show originally aired back in 1975 and before they battled indians, the original "Ghostbusters" also '75 starting Larry Stork, Forrest Tucker, & Kong. The songtrack on these shows were great. BB & The Hong Kong Cavaliers are not The Monkeys. BB lacks a decent song track. At least we get to see the devote effort of saving mankind from world destruction armed only with slingshots, boyscout knives, and six shooters unlike today where Captain America can't even save himself or maybe it's because america is only doing a job we all know needs to be done.  The movie was put together well.  It is a classic.  Jeff Goldberg also appears in this film but I don't know why.  Anyway, "wherever you go, there you are"
Once again, the powers that be at Amazon have chosen to REFUSE to tell us if (in this case) the Darin/Dee flicks If A Man Answers and That Funny Feeling are in WIDESCREEN or not. Pan-and-scan is garbage, and we won't buy it! ---  --- (That's why I only gave 1 star for now. If they turn out to be widescreen, I'll give them both 5 stars.) ---  --- "Format: Color" doesn't cut it. Color isn't a format, anyway - it's a specification or type. Widescreen is a format (as is DVD and VHS, to begin with). ---  --- So why the deep dark secret about certain movies, Amazon? You list many others as being widescreen, so why do you go on to neglect so many other hundreds, though? ---  --- If it's a standard screen piece of junk, go ahead and say so, and be done with it, and we'll boycott it. But right now all you're doing by holding back this important information is SLOWING DOWN SALES
I give 5 stars for the easy spirit sandle I ordered , I like it. Delivery is fast. I will order something else
I often wonder if some if not most of the people writing rave reviews, 5 stars, are really paid, biased, professionals pumping up the movie for increased DVD sales. --- 
I am addicted to these. They are delicious, not dry at all, and there are lots of crackers in each container. Yum!
fall asleep in ---  minutes what a joke.don`t waste your money on this product
I love this salt and use it on my french fries as well as on popcorn.  It is not as good as fleur de sel or some of the other "gourmet" salts, but it is only 15 cents per ounce, not 15 dollars.  Note that this salt is flaked, unlike the normal crystals for which Diamond Salt is known.  It absolutely CLINGS to the surface of the popcorn, fries, and other similarly-textured foods MUCH better.  It has a cleaner taste than some of the brown or grey sea salts and CLEAN is always good in my book.   ---  --- As a treat, I sometimes Iick the tip of my index finger, sprinkle a little of this on it, and then pretend like I'm getting ready to do a mini tequilla shooter, but without the lime.  Almost like a couple of hours on the beach. ---  --- I can only give it four stars instead of five because it is NOT IODIZED and you could end  up looking just like a frog with big goiter things on your neck if you don't get enough iodine.  This is not a problem for people who eat a lot of seafood, but if you live in the Midwest far from the ocean it could cause some difficulties
RKO Radio Pictures present "BORN TO KILL" (1947) (92 mins/B&W) (Dolby digitally remastered) --- Starring Claire Trevor, Lawrence Tierney, Walter Slezak, Audrey Long & Phillip Terry --- Directed by Robert Wise and released in May 3, 1947, our story line and film, Uncompromising film noir which sees psychopath Tierney marry wealthy girl Long, only to feel more in common with the black sheep of the family, his wife's sister (Trevor). Deliciously dark and directed with enthusiasm by Wise before he'd made it big, Born to Kill is a genuine oddity which explores the dark side of sexuality without moralizing, with the bonus of a cracking murder plot to add some spice. Tierney pitches his performance just right ... The film sits well with all those minor noir classics the late 40's and early 50's with apparent ease: Wise's own "The Set-Up"; Anthony Mann's "Raw Deal" and the "T-Men", "Kiss Of Death", and Ray's masterly debut, "They Live By Night". ---  --- Under Robert Wise  (Director), Herman Schlom  (Producer), Eve Greene  (Screenwriter), James Gunn  (Book Author), Richard Macaulay  (Screenwriter), Robert de Grasse  (Cinematographer), Constantin Bakaleinikoff  (Musical Direction/Supervision), Paul Sawtell  (Composer (Music Score), Les Millbrook  (Editor), Albert S.

This monitor is only great if your house is smaller than our Tokyo apartment. Although the monitor is sensitive and clear, moving the receiver any more than 15 feet away from the transmitter results in intermittent and loud beeps indicating a loss of signal
I loved the first Xenosaga. Then, this arrived. Episode 2 isen't a bad game in terms of the story, the intro is absolutely DYNAMITE. Then you get into a battle. Now, if you like tactical stuff, this is a good game for you. But if you're trying to fight your way through a hoard of enemies to get to a save point in record timing, I say save your money. Gone is the amazingly well-done battle system in the first episode. In its place stands a completely out-of-nowhere new way of battling that takes 15 minutes to get rid of a couple of easy enemies( the easy ones in this game have around 2000 Hps). Ridiculous, but that's not all. The enemies have weak "zones" that depend of the height of the attack that you input.The zones are A,B and C, A being the highest. Triangle=C, square=B and Circle=A -SOMETIMES-. See what I mean? It's completely screwed-up and you have to become deeply --- addicted to the game to understand its full potential. And if       that wasn't enough, they changed the voice actors too. Kos-Mos's  --- voice sounds more like an operator than a robot's and Momo sounds like a brat. At least, chaos' voice has improved. I'd prefer playing episode 1 twice than playing this. I just hope Namco comes out with a better sequel, otherwise spend your moey on something else (like Shadow Hearts, for example).    
CT is quick to call the collection agency.  They require written "opt-out" notification from the subscriber that the subscription is to be terminated.  Beware, these guys are a credit risk.  Too much trouble for what is otherwise a good magazine
Completely worthless! If you liked the film, go buy the DVD because this album has no redeeming qualities.  The sound quality is fair at best, even for a live album.  Almost every track is jammed with totally worthless `commentary' at the beginning or end of the song.  The `commentary' consists of recordings of about a dozen people having random conversations over the phone and laughing for no reason.  It would have been nice if they had put these `commentaries' on different tracks because the way they have it on this CD you have to wait through about a minute and a half of this crap to get to the song you want to hear.  The worst part about the album is the lack of The Fugees, which means no `Killing Me Softly'.  Sadly, you can tell that most of the artists on this album haven't played a show or practiced in a long time as they are a bit rusty and sound horrible, even for a live recording.  Some of them sounded almost as bad as Fallout Boy on SNL
I am writing this review primarily to let people know what to expect from this product, since Amazon/Toys R Us don't seem to have a clue - even the image was provided by a thoughtful customer. I bought this in-store at Toys R Us because sizing information was not available online (except for the size of the box, for some bizarre reason) and I didn't want to take a chance with getting the wrong size. So let me share that information with you - this helmet is suitable for head sizes from 20.5" to 22". I think overall that this is a great set, but I marked it down a point because it does not include elbow protection. From my own experience learning to skate or even snowboard, I can say that I would generally fall onto my knees or the heels of my hands, so knee pads and wrist guards would be perfect for me. But with a young child who knows?! This is for my neice (I am not a parent) and whilst I am generally happy with the set as it is, I think it would be nice to include the elbow protection (which is afterall available in other sets, but does not appear to be available separately) to make a complete safety package. Perhaps we are supposed to buy and extra set so we have the elbow pads and two sets of knee pads, or perhaps I am a touch too cynical
Argento is an incarnation of everything that film is and everything that it could have been as conceived by Lumiere. After Hitchcock and Ray, Leone and Fuller, Argento is the last true auteur to make genre films. Visually, a film like Profondo Rosso calls upon the ghosts of the cinema because everything that is filmed, objects and people alike, take on the same importance and that this inevitably leads to the resolution of the mystery which is at the center of the film. Argento can only film something as itself and this is why he is an extraordinary filmmaker. Cinema is not an answer but a question and Argento is the answer to Eisenstein's theory of film as violence, violence not only in the images themselves but in the great void that awaits them. A murder, a painting, a mother, a son, a mirror, all of these things will lead to a beautiful composition of images in which the mystery of seeing, the mystery of cinema, the questions, are resolved.
It was suggested by Amazon.com that I buy this product since I was purchasing a Canon PowerShot S2IS Digital Camera. Not knowing any better, I bought it.  It doesn't even WORK with this model camera. I bought a memory card reader instead at a local store & bypassed the need for an adapter altogether
I would give this 3.5 stars if possible. Its a decent table, the chip holders/with cup holders are easy to rearrange accoring to preference. The Table itself seems to be a piece of plywood, with some green felt tacked both sides of it; and slots cut out for the chip trays.  ---  --- It works, but could have been a nicer, better made product for the money.  ---  --- Watch out for the shipping costs,  almost 1/3 the price of the table. Pretty expensive
I remember the first time I used WordPerfect, and the first time I used Microsoft Word.  I couldn't imagine why anyone would choose the vastly inferior Word over WordPerfect.   ---  --- Years passed, and now I find myself using MS Word every day.  I'd been ground down by the thousands of Word users who'd picked it up along with PowerPoint and Excel, and who didn't have enough savvy to know how to convert documents from one format to another.  WordPerfect _always_ converted MSWord docs.  MSWord never reciprocated.  Shouldn't that have told them which program had a mandate to make the customer's life that much easier?  With each successive iteration, WordPerfect introduced some new innovation, and in the next incarnation, Microsoft aped it.  It got to the point where users would nod appreciatively at the innovation, then wait the inevitable year-long interval for Microsoft to catch up, and then they'd buy that. ---  --- Well, due to an outrageously fair price point and multiuser license, I tried WordPerfect X3, and it was like coming home.  It's nothing short of amazing.  I went out and bought a copy for my parents, and they love it, too.  Now my brother, an attorney, has asked me to buy him a copy, since so many of the federal prosecutors he works with have WordPerfect only, and can't seem to open his Word files.  The more things change, the more they stay the same
This works better than any other women's shaver I've ever used.  It does give a close shave without irritating the skin
I am not an expert in anything. I am an emergency room nurse though, and I hear stories of babies dying from SIDS.  We thought we'd try this product as the reviews are great. We love it. The sensor pad is so sensitive that it picks up his every respiration! I would highly recommend this for every baby, as SIDS is a risk up until 12 months of age. I feel so much better, knowing that the alarm will sound if he stops breathing. We plan to take this with us when we travel. It is easy to use and it really works. If you buy the one with the two parent units, you can use the unit as a regular baby monitor instead, or as well
This is one of my all-time favorite CDs. I loved all the songs on this CD except one. My favorite is "Black Girl Pain" and it should be an anthem and inspriration for Black women all over the globe. I had the pleasure of seeing Talib in concert a few months ago in Atlanta and his live show was even better than his CD. True Hip-hop lives
I purchased this product thinking that it would revolutionize my financial organization -but I should have known better after I have started to read all of the product reviews. ---  --- I can't even give a thorough review, since I can't seem to get past even downloading my savings & checking information from my bank.  The incorrect balances are showing, and the register doesn't show all of the transactions that my banking website shows.  I'm finding that I have to actually check my banking website to cross-check Quicken!  To me, that ain't so quick. ---  --- I've just spent over 45 minutes on an online "chat" - which was more of a waste of time than anything.  The customer's support suggestions pretty much entailed deleting files, restarting, deleting files, restarting. ---  --- 10 minutes ago, he wrote this: --- Ashish R.: Thank you. --- Ashish R.:  Please  give me 2 minutes only. --- Stacey: I think I would just like to return the product... --- Stacey: It isn't working... --- Stacey: are you still there? --- Stacey: Right... --- Stacey: Hello? ---  --- I'm still sitting here waiting.  I want to return this product - DO NOT BUY! 
This DVD covers addition from 1 plus 1 to 3 plus 3 plus 3 in about 60 seconds!  It does not give enough BODY to the addition explanation and is hard to follow.  It was a pure waste of money
I think is a "must" for any beginner, for a low price you can have almost all the different size of EP. Try them for a few months and then when you will be completely sure what do you want and buy the EP that you need. 
As a 21 year old, I felt a little out of place buying this soundtrack.  But, I was so excited that I had finally found a soundtrack to these two wonderful movies.  Imagine my disappointment when I could aurally pick out that Rosemary Clooney's parts were not sung by Rosemary Clooney!  I DO NOT recommend buying this album.  Enjoy the music when you watch the movies, instead.  Trust me, it's better that way
We got Jason in space and we get Pinhead in space.  This is pure nonsense.  Words of wisdom to the makers of these sequels: when you start putting horror movie villains in space to kill people, it's time to stop making these movies!
If you like to take pictures with macro lense, it sucks. I've had many canon cameras and this one takes the the prize for worst quality. If you get closer than five inches, the pictures messes up. --- I've had no other problem with the hardware, though I hate carrying around that dock and it's odd shaped charger. No other charger cable in the world is going to fit! So loose it and you're screwed. --- oh, and night photos also suck. BIG TIME, even with the flash on
Face Oasis isn't like any other moisturizer I've tried - One application makes my skin appear plump and well-hydrated even if I've neglected to drink my 8 glasses of water that day.  It isn't at all greasy, absorbs quickly, and serves as a great base over which to apply my makeup. The guys I've introduced it to have raved about it as well!
while i recently called "ballad of cable hogue" my favorite sam peckinpah movie, this outre take on revenge is undoubtedly his best, and imho one of the best of the 1970s. for those who havent seen it, the setup is the daughter of (presumably) mexican land tycoon has been impregnated by one alfredo garcia; the angry dad offers a huge reward to whomever delivers to him the severed head of alfredo, and down on his luck bum warren oates (think a seedier version of bogart in "sierra madre") is hired by a pair of "entrepeneurs" (gig young and robert webber) to do the dirty work. the irony: alfredo is already dead in a car accident. and that is the setup for where the movie really takes off in a spin of revenge, justice, betrayals, love, &c -- all against the sight and smell of the deteriorating severed head rotting in 100 degree plus heat. oates was always an underappreciated actor, but here he gives his best performance, matched by mexican actress isela vega as his doomed girlfriend. not a movie you want to watch frequently, but it is a masterpiece.
What a wonderful and diverse CD.  Sit in front of a fire on a rainy day with a nice glass of Oregon Pinot Noir in your hand.  Close your eyes relax and let the sounds of Liebert surround you.  His talent is evident in the expressions as he's playing.  The guitar seems an extension of his own form, not a separate instrument. 
This is great for young babies..once my son became more active (which is when it's safe to use a regular crib bumper anyway) he would put his legs on it and it would scrunch down since it's very thin - unlike the big padded more sturdy bumpers that come w/ a crib set.  I think that is the only flaw but I will definitely use it again for my next infant/baby
It was everything it advertised as being.  I can carry my digital camera and lenses as well as two point and shoot digital cameras.  Being a slingshot backpack, my back doesn't moan and groan as it did with other camera bags.  I like the feature of swinging the bag to the front and to get my cameras with out removing the backpack
I purchased this case for my Canon A530 camera. I find that it does a great job of being light,durable,and compact. It keeps the camera clean and scratch free. However I wish the case had a better carrying capacity. I would have liked a bit more space for spare batteries and chips. I use different ones for different pictures or video. Batteries do tend to give out after a long day shooting and convient extras would be handy. ---  The case has beltloops but not a good shoulder strap for times when a belt is not worn. That can be a bit akward. Otherwise this case is a good protector of my camera and fits it well.
I have followed Bruce Hornsby for over 20 years and own every album he has ever come out with including two concert DVDs.  I was reluctant to buy intersections due to owning all the other, but if you have been to  Hornsby concert you know that he always keeos things fresh..no exception here.  I loved the DVD of some of his performances.  There are treasures here, Imagine, solo on the Piano at an awards show, the Star Spangled Banner at the World Series with Marsalis, and his performance with BB King.it is a must for the hard core hornsby fan
Was delivered quickly, was priced right, and folded up into a small size so I could stuff it into a suitcase before going on vacation.  When unfolded it held more than the suitcase.  High quality material and excellent workmanship.  I think I'll buy another one for a spare
Our dog loves these treats and we love how good they are for him. Amazon has also been the best deal we've gotten for them. Petsmart & Petco are a lot more expensive and don't have all the flavor choices.
I have a recently purchased Acrobat 8.0 Professional. It installed fine on my new Vista machine, although it cites only Office 2003 products. But I have MS Office 2007.  After installation (and reinstallation) no Acrobat conversion options show on MS Word, and when trying to use Acrobat directly for an MS Word file conversion it first reinstalls itself, and then reports that the Word file (I have tried several) is corrupt. ---  --- I now have to ask colleagues with older software to do my PDF conversion. --- I could not find out if or when Adobe plans to be compatible with Vista and Office 2007
I LOVE THE PRODUCT, AS AN AFTERTHOUGHT THIS WAS SENT FROM SEPHORA WHERE WITH EVERY PURCHASE YOU RECEIVE A BONUS SAMPLE AND EVEN FREE SHIPPING IF YOU QUALIFY. WISH I'D WENT TO THEIR SITE, SINCE I'M A FREQUENT SHOPPER THERE ALSO, OH WELL AMAZON IS WHERE I WILL BUY BOOKS, DVDS   ETC..
I never write reviews, but I had to make my comments on these socks. I bought them to keep my feet warm at me desk at work.  I put them on and turned the switch to high.  They DO NOT EVEN GET WARM at all...I thought it was broken, but realized it was both socks that didn't get warm. These are a total rip off and I am going to try and send them back. 
If you see the description: made in Italy, be careful! They are made in India. I have written to amazon to let them change. But if you still see made in Italy, be careful! Everybody knows the difference
As we all know, you're supposed to put your baby to sleep on his back to help prevent SIDS. The SleepSack is a great product! It keeps baby nice and warm, yet you don't have to worry about a blanket. And there's space down in the bottom for his feet so he's not too restricted. Also, the great thing is that it zips from top to bottom, so you don't have a big zipper poking baby in the face
 --- This is THE BEST SELLING Bible in America for good reason! Ease of comprehension, lovely modern English, pleasing packaging, and the best conservative scholarhip for both textual reconstruction and language translation. ---  --- Read I WAS A TEENAGE JEHOVAH'S WITNESS and JEHOVAH UNMASKED for two of the wildest rides ever! --- 
I was so happy when I found these shoes, they are cute and comfortable, exactly what I was looking for. BUT after about two weeks of wearing them, always with socks or pantyhose, they started to smell terrible. I don't have this problem with any of my other shoes. This was SO disappointing, I will either try to return them or just trash them. 
I got this software from Office max. which is on sale for $8 on last week. --- My 6 year old kid, start learning typing and he keep saying he want to type all the time. ---  --- Pros: --- Settings are awesome.  --- You can choose two types of keyboards --- You can choose your words per min speed and many other aspects --- You can choose 4 different musics or do not have any. --- You can choose the difficulty levels. --- Games and encouraging things for kids. ---  --- Cons: --- Still needs to find one. ---  --- How does it matter about cartoon chars speaking to you,  --- Adult can also learn from this CD, just by skipping cartoon talk.
Sit down under a tree, give it a big hug, fire up you bong and go to sleep. That's what I was waiting for Freeman to do all movie. It's a shame that special effects that were so ground breaking were waisted on this Sci-fi Hippie flick. I'm surprised that Freeman's suit wasn't tie-dyed. Keep your money say no to drugs!
MS put Office 2007 on a DVD rather than a CD so there is only one disk, so they make the installation easier right off the bat. Unlike all previous versions of Office, you do not have to get into the details of what options you want. In previous versions, if you didn't make sure you installed all the features, when you went to do a function that wasn't installed, you had to dig out your Office disks and install the feature. A huge pain, but not anymore. ---  --- The installation is hands down the easiest of all versions of Office. You don't have to tell it manually where to find your files. You don't have to manually put in your favorite buttons. It's all done for you. Yes it takes some getting use to the new layout of the functions, but once you figure them out, it is so nice and smooth. This version is light years better than all previous versions. ---  --- The most impressive part of the installation is Outlook 2007. In all previous versions, you had to EXPORT and IMPORT all your files and Contacts. Anyone who experienced this, knows that it never went that smooth. Sometimes it was awful and you lost emails and Contacts in the transfer, and the time it took to do this, was very painful. This is not the case with Outlook 2007. Just load the program and it does all the transfers  from your previous version of Outlook. You don't have to do a thing, and you're up and running without missing a beat when the program is done loading. You will be shocked how simple it is. ---  --- Anything new has it's growing pains to learn, but once you do, you will be very glad you made the change
I gave this necklace to my daughter who was becoming a new big sister and she just loved it.  The necklace was very symbolic because the big heart represented Big Sister and the little heart represented little sister holding on.  I just loved it
Throughly dismisses all Jazz after 1960, including Fusion, Free Jazz, and everything thereafter. Marsalis actually calls Cecil Taylor's music "self-indulgent bullsh**" Apparently Taylor was not allowed to rebut this during the film. How was that allowed to air on the supposedly intellectual (but more likely agenda-driven) on PBS, I will never understand. If you think Swing is the only valid form of Jazz, you will love this series. If you think Coltrane is a God, you get five minutes' summary. So lets see here: 15 hours on Louis Armstrong and Duke, 5 minutes on Coletrane, and a total didmissal of everything after Duke's death. Reminds me of the Republisuck's "Fair and Balanced" nonsense. PBS, this is your wake-up call. Stop trying to rewrite history - Jazz ain't in a museum. Just ask the artists (most of whom are alive) whom Burns left out. Metheny, you out there
This magazine used to be very thorough, and it used to be very good at providing me with TONS of deals and tips that I never would have found on my own. It was great, and very opinionated. But last year sometime, they changed the look of it and now there's a lot less text. It's much more a style magazine now, and that's not what I want in a travel magazine that I have bought to tell me about money saving! Worse, except for the 40 Best Vacation Bargains, which are still okay, most of the articles forget to incluce a lot of money-saving tips and instead they too often suggest I do expensive things. Since when is a $225 a night hotel considered budget?? The headlines and captions are expecially smart-aalecky.  It's not as good with the expert advice as it used to be! I noticed that Arthur Frommer isn't editing it anymore which maybe is why--bring him back! My search for a true money-saving travel magazine has unfortunately resumed again
As the PS2 does not have HDMI outputs for High-Definition TV's, the Monster Cable GameLink 400 component cable is the next best thing and worth a few bucks more. You'd have to be retarded to not notice the difference between these component cables and standard (red, white, yellow) AV cables picture clarity. They are in two different worlds and Monster fully delivers. However, your TV must have component (red, blue, green) inputs for this cable to be useful. ---  --- Ensure that you have a fiber optic digital cable for your sound to go from your PS2 to your compatible tv/receiver. These cables are for picture only and do not have a sound cable. Therefore, you'll have to forget using the single plug-in the PS2 offers for both audio and video. However, your sound will be uncompressed, fully digital audio. This is definitely a plus, rather than a negative. Any mid-priced television or receiver built in the last six years will have a digital audio input
This locket was dime-sized--much smaller than I had anticipated.  It was also very plain and looked cheap.  The mother-of-pearl locket was MUCH BETTER
I tried my new bowls out this morning and was very disapointed. The suction won't stay down for more than a second or two on our wood table. On the kitchen counter top(formica) they stay put for longer but not long enough for a meal. --- I am returning mine to the store today. Dissapointing. --- BUT, they are darling colors and the lids are a nice feature
We had the forerunner (Diaper Genie 1).  No matter what I did, it still stunk.  I would add baking soda after poopy diapers, line it with an odor protecting garbage bag as well as the normal liners.  It always smelled like poop!!  One day it broke, so we looked for a replacement.  I was a little hesitant to purchase this product because of our previous one, but we thought we would give it a try.  It's amazing.  My daughter had diareha and a day later still no stench!!!  Also, it's so easy.  No twisting.  Just put the diaper thru the trap door.  It's easy to load and change cartridges.  This is definately a great buy!!! 
The cover is easy to put on and take off.  It covers completely and has a very sturdy feeling to it.  It's a great value! I would recommend highly
paid double what i found at another site outside of amazon/this store - NEVER AGAIN
Another solid text from our friend Sensei Demura. This is part of his popular set on Okinawan Weaponry and well worth the cost. Portrayed in the book is weapon history, basic stances, grips, blocks and strikes. Demura also covers self defense applications against many various attacks. For all Karate and Kobudo students I would reccomend this book
I bought two of these Weber Roasters because they make the process of roasting chicken so easy. No can and a nonstick surface make removing the cooked chicken so much easier and clean up is a cinch. Also because these roasters retain the juices in the pan, the inside of my BBQ is much cleaner and I don't have to clean it after every chicken I cook
This review is for Turbo Tax Basic for Mac/PC 2005 --- The software is easy enough to use but either out of curiosity or self abuse, I checked the results manually and found a round off flaw contained in the program.  If you are self employed and use Form SE (Self Employment Tax Form) the program fails to round "up" correctly.  The mistake favors the individual and not the Feds.  This is a math error and the IRS can red flag it.  ---   --- I remember several years ago I purchased the Deluxe or Premire verson and the program recommended that I might consider putting $300 into my IRA in order to lower my tax bracket, it was great!  However subsquent versions did not do this, after which I only purchase the Basic version.
Good product; however, I don't understand why it requires lengthy updates  --- every time I open the program.   ---  --- Perhaps they should try to get it right the first time.  And it's impossible to tell whether the updates do anything for me. ---  --- Using it with Quicken is a PITA. ---  --- It is unclear to me how you get more than one state
I subscribe to Entertainment Weekly, Premiere, and any magazine with a photo of Johnny Depp or hobbits on the cover, but Scr(i)pt is my favorite magazine. --- Every issue of Scr(i)pt has articles by the screenwriters of movies that are just opening, explaining something about how the movie was written and featuring excerpts from the screennplay of that movie.  These are triply helpful, as they (1) provide insight into how a successful screenwriter works his craft, (2) supply brief examples of what the movie you just saw (or are about to see) looks like on the page, and (3) are a useful tool in deciding which movie to go see Saturday night. --- Each issue also has articles of the more general How To... variety, although these range from How To Write Great Scenes/Characters to How To Pitch To Studios to Why Studio Execs Are Using Your Script To Wrap Fish.  For a while there was a series of articles that were simply a compilation of all the genre cliches, written in the hopes that if you knew what they were you could avoid them; they were invariably hilarious.  These How To/Writing Advice articles are often extremely funny (this is not meant as an insult--they are meant to be funny as well as helpful). --- Finally, every issue has the news on sales, contest winners, and whatnot that is essential for any working screenwriter, with a generous helping of heartwarming success stories to keep your spirits up while you're waiting to hear from the studios. --- I highly recommend this magazine.  Enjoy
Even non-celiac people should switch over. Here's an amazing gravy for chicken or pork chops. Try it next time and serve next to mashed potatoes: 2c. water and 1/2c. mix. Bring to gentle boil over high heat. Remove from heat immediately. Stir in 1/4c sour cream. Pour over meat, browned in a skillet. Simmer on lowest heat until meat is cooked through, turning and stirring often to prevent skorching. Hmmmm. I'm getting hungry
When I first bought this, over a year ago, I was hesitant about the price - it being so low compared to other brands. Rest assured, this is all you will need! My finicky baby had to have his warm Alimentum. This bottle warmer is sooo quick and easy, I could put the water up to the predetermined line of the measurer(that comes with) poor it in and left it alone. It was ready within a minute and after a few shakes, it was the perfect temperature. This is also helpful for warming up baby food jars (Comes with a special attachment just for that purpose) The warmer was dropped twice on the floor so it can defently take a beating! Outside is easy to clean (the water deposits on the warmer - not so much) All in all It did the job for my little boy. And for $16 GET IT! And Get one for the Grandparents! Don't spend $30 on a bigger and bulker item that will do the same thing
POOR quality unit.  Worked sometimes, sometimes not.  Gave up and returned it after a couple of weeks of trying it out
This headset is actually really comfortable.  I really don't opt for headsets that go over my ear and this one works perfectly.  The sound quality is really good and people on the other end can hear me quite well.  Great product and great price
Here's a real-review: ---  --- *The first 100 pages are about how her mother made her get a nose job that when wrong. --- *The second 100 pages are about the Frankenstein movie. --- *The last 90 pages are about every movie-star that's ever gotten cosmetic surgery. ---  --- And the whole thing is stitched together with an English teacher's weekend theory on how a mix of "Simulations and Simulacra" + "The Ego and the Id" explain why people get cosmetic surgery.  If you're someone who orders books online based on catchy titles, then do yourself a favor and skip this one.  How can a book on cosmetic surgery not even talk about the golden ratio?
I've owned many Sony electronics in the past and have always liked their styling and functionality -- lots of hardy Walkmen, useful shortwave and portable radios, stylish TVs and high quality cassette recorders.  I still have a Sony mini component stereo model FH-E656 (made in Japan) which I bought in 1992 for US$400+; but rather than pay to fix its worn-out CD player, I decided to purchase this new Sony MHCEC70 component stereo (made in China). ---  --- PLUSES:  --- decent sound --- good functionality --- easy set-up and intuitive operation --- simple remote -- but only covers basic functions ---  --- CONS: --- very short speaker leads --- unattractive styling (for my tastes) -- resembles a boombox --- only holds 3 CDs vs 5 for comparable Panasonic units ---  --- At first glance, I was disappointed by the cheap construction, skimpy manual and very short speaker leads -- the manufacturer seemed to be counting pennies.  But then I thought: in 2006 for $150, I can't expect the same quality as I received in 1992 for $400.  Everything is made more cheaply now and almost all in China.  So, for the money, it suits my purposes as a nice sounding stereo unit for the bedroom.  The real test will be how long the CD changer works -- to be safe, this time I bought the 2 year replacement warranty.  I haven't blasted it at full volume, but it seems to have plenty of power when needed. ---  --- I originally bought a $300 Panasonic unit (SC-PM71SD MP3 SD Micro System) which was returned because it didn't have the full data recording feature as advertised (data recording was crippled by DRM limitations).  This Sony stereo costs half as much, and has almost all the same functionality
My husband and I bought a second one after having had the first one for a little while for my 6 year old son.  He liked it so much that we bought another one for my almost 4 year old.  The seat is incredibly easy to clean (which is wonderful as the boys snack in the car a lot) and it's also so easy to fold and throw in the back of the car when we aren't using it.  Both boys feel very comfortable in it and seem to not mind riding in it for long periods of time. 
I bought this one as a cheap extra battery.  I have seen no differences in performance so far and would therefore recommend this as a great extra or replacement battery
I recommend this phone to ANYBODY.  I absolutely love it.  I have had it for three months now and not a problem so far.  The music player is great, and I swear...the camera looks ALOT better than 1.3 mega pixel.  The handset is wonderful, and so is the headset included with it.  If you buy this phone, it WILL last you a long time.   ---  --- But yeah..so far, no problems whatsoever.  I love it. [..
This product is great.  It is simple to use and offers everything you need to do cd and dvd recording.  The addition of tivo to go transfers and dvd menus make this product a true winner.  The only problem I have encountered is the length of encoding recordings from tivo to burn them to dvd.  If you need to record audio or video to cd or dvd this is the product you need.  Don't wast time with anything else
This magizine has the latest star scoop and the coolest stories sentin by reader
Everyone in my family is enamored with this fantastic Darth Vader mask. We bought it initially for my son, who is Darth Vader obsessed, but it's quickly become the house favorite. (Even Grandpa can't resist putting this mask on and pretending to be Darth for a spell.)  ---  --- On another note: we keep this helmet on our bookshelf in the living room and it makes a great conversation piece. It is so realistic looking and it makes a menacing piece of art on display
Great concept, but they slip off my ears way too often. Often enough that I stopped wearing them
In March 2006, there are only three or four books that boast Haskell in their titles.  They are all excellent books.  But the world can benefit from more Haskell books.  In fact, we are in need of such books, especially CS1 texts.  This book is a pleasure to read.  I suspect that even math haters will not find it hostile.  Anyone learning Haskell will find the book and its companion web site a valuable resouce.  On the web site, you will find the source code from the book, such as Powerseries.hs.  You can quickly play and experiment with it; read and learn from it.   --- I wish more books are as pleasant and affordable ($25)
this is the best watch if you consider following things:  --- 1. Looks: the color of dial and the feeling of dial on hands is really beautiful.  --- 2. Size and thickness: If you search for slim watches, skagen will be your first and final choice.  --- 3. Mesh Band: This type of band is the speciality of skagen. its un-comparable.  --- 4. Price: Considering the price for overall quality this watch is really affordable. ---  --- Bottom Line: Everyone will notice and appreciate about it.
I have to say this mouse pad has far exceeded anything I hoped for. When I first opened the box it was shipped in I was very put off. There was a Very, Very strong chemical smell. I chalked it up to something in the packaging material. It turns out that was not where the smell was coming from. It was the mouse pad itself. Having worked in a shoe factory years ago I was able to identify the smell as an industrial glue. The smell hung around for a couple of days. Now, 1 week after having received my purchase if I put my nose close to the pad, it still carries the faint smell of industrial glue. I would caution those with allergies and/or asthma to consider this prior to purchase. As an asthmatic I can say it did affect my breathing some what. That seems to have gotten better as the smelled has lessened. I have finished with my public health warning. On to the mouse pad.  ---      It is simply the best mouse pad I have ever used. I have had wrist problems for over 4 years now. I have had swelling and pain from my right pinkie finger to my elbow as a result of console gaming and lots of keyboarding work. In the past week my swelling has greatly reduced. My pain is almost gone. My wrist sits perfectly on  the wrist rest. The pad actually cradles my wrist. The wrist rest moves with my hand, so well and with so much support, it seems to be an extension of my body. A new improved appendage. I have found myself resting my wrist on the pad even while not computing but just sitting at my desk. It truly is that comfortable. I already have plans to purchase two more for friends as Christmas gifts. Worth Every Cent! Go For It! You Will Not Be Disappointed! 
I didn't expect this series of books to be laid out the way they are. I am disappointed that the "notes" are simply a glorified glossary arranged by chapter rather than alphabetical. Key points from the book are not bulleted or organized based on content presentation, rather key terms are defined and that is all.
Last night, as I was going to sleep I listened to a variety of songs - Foo Fighters, Elton John, Queen, Johnny Cash and more.  It was an experience.  I heard more from Folsom Prison than ever before.  Captain Fantastic was amazing.  Not being an audiophile, it is hard to explain, but the music seemed new.  
Tastes just like regular skippy i.e. unnatural texture because it contains PALM OIL
It never ceases to amaze me that you Brits eat this horrific dog food-paste.  ---  --- No wonder you lost the revolutionary war.   ---  --- It's clear from you eating Marmite and Vegamite that you never deserved those colonies anyway
I haven't used it thoroughly yet. But from what I have seen so far, it is a pretty good scale to track your everyday fat loss progress. I am satisfied with this purchase for the price and quality and ease of use. I use it daily to track my body fat % and weight. So far used it for only myself. Haven't checked it out for more than 1 users
I bought this stuff from the Shopping Channel, and thought it wasn't bad, until I went to get my hair colored.  --- The color didn't take! --- My hair is shoulder length, and I only used the Ojon on the bottom 5 or 6 inches, because that's the part that was dry.  --- The color only took on the 'new growth', not on the rest of my hair - the hair that I had put the Ojon on!  --- The smell of the oil, the shampoo, or the conditioner didn't bother me, but the HAIR SPRAY was disgusting. People remarked that I had overdosed on perfume, so I had to wash it again to get the rotten smell out of my hair. --- I definitely wouldn't recommend this to anyone who colors their hair.
I love this bag! I purchased the pink/chocolate color and I get alot of compliments on how cute it is. I am in my early 20's and I have a 2 and half year old and this bag can hold what I need for him as well as my things and still not look bulky or overstuffed and at the same time, is very stylish. I really like those trendy baby bags for those young moms, but they are very expensive. This is lightweight, made of cotton, so very easy to clean. I chose standard shipping and it came so quickly. I am very satisfied with my purchase
I love Tink! I found this item to be very easy to put on my van steering wheel. It does not slide like others I have had before, but easy to remove too. 
Not all bras are created equal.  But what makes it so special?  As a fuller figured female, let me explain the merits: ---  --- 1)Support - it does a great job. This bra does not sag over the course of the day.  Your figure looks just as great in the evening as when you put the bra on in the morning. --- 2)Coverage - this gives the modest more coverage so people don't see what you don't want them to see.  For starters, the fabric is thicker than any bra that I have ever owned.  And no, this is  not a padded bra, the material is just thicker.  Since the material is thicker, it means that it is truly opaque.  Not even with the thinnest and whitest t-shirt will you be embarassed. --- 3)Comfort - this bra is quite comfortable, especially considering that it is an underwire.  I have not experienced the sensation of  underwire digging in nor the straps gouging my shoulders.  But on occassion I do feel some pressure from one of the straps (hence the 4 star rating). ---  ---  --- Now there are a few things that may give you pause. ---  --- 1)Price - this bra averages $60-65 in department stores, not a cheap undergarment. --- 2)Size - this bra is larger compared to other bras of the same size.  What I mean is that the bra has a defined shape... it does not lie flat as the cups are molded.  And there is more fabric that connects the cups together.  A good descriptive word is "substantial", but don't think bulky.  This bra does disappear under t-shirts giving you a beautiful form rather than a body marked by undergarment lines. ---  --- This is an undergarment that I intend to buy again... and again... and again
I was able to put this on myself. I really love my steering wheel cover. Will definitely want to get the other accessories
My family really enjoyed this rice pudding. I loved the real cinammon stick, it gave the rice a rich flavor. The aroma in the kitchen had everyone looking forward to a real treat. Best of all is how simple it was. Boil the water, empty package, wait 20 minutes. Enjoy!
This is a good introduction to many off the beaten paths of America.  In fact, the real star of the show, asie from the ubiquitous red Ford Taurus, is the scenery of America itself.  The camera and narrator takes the viewers to many places that have unique characteristics.  Unfortunately there is no interaction with the locals so we do not get a truely complete coverage of each scene, but the point of the series is to give a "Reader's Digest" view of places people can visit. ---  --- But excellent photography and the knack for finding out of the way events are the hallmark of this series. Each "trip" is actually a roundabout path that is really serveral "family vacations" combined into a one hour program. This is a great cure for cabin fever in the midst of a winter snowstorm
I like guess watches spicily gold candy rock and white. gold one is look like really gold
I work at a daycare and have an 11 mo old and can promise this is a great toy!  My baby loves it and she usually gets bored with toys fast.  All of the babies like to open and close the door and crawl through.  It also has a doorbell that rings and a light that turns on.  It plays several different songs and really keeps the attention of older children as well as babies.  I highly recommend
My three sons and I saw these pogos demonstrated at the Cleveland X Games a couple years ago.  We could not beleive what we saw.  This is unlike any pogo stick you have ever seen.  For the money, it's a tremendous value, and their customer service is the best I have come across.  They also make a high(er) octane version called the Flybar 1200 which supports larger riders.  For adults (yes, adults will love this thing!)or kids this is a "must have" this Christmas.  My youngest son can't wait for their next model (Flybar 400) due in '07 I believe...An absolute, 100%, thumbs-up!  Jim Woods, Akron, Ohi
It says some silly things which might not make us laugh. but overall a cute toy and kids will like i
I had one of these similar many years ago and let it go at a garage sale. Dumb idea! As I get older, this Stamina machine has replaced it and is giving me all the exercise I need. Good to set in front of the tv and row for 30 minutes, I've gone from a size 40 to a size 36 waist. I like the hydraulic part of it and the adjustability
My daughter is 2 1/2 years old, 32 lbs. and I wanted to get back into jogging.  After reviewing many strollers I decided on this one for it's price and features (swivel front tire, rubber tires, tray for myself and my daughter-snacks and juice keep her from getting antsy on my runs).  I wasn't sure if she would be too big for a jogging stroller but she fits very comfortably in this one and hasn't complained during any of my runs.  It handles great too!!  My only complaint is that I have not found it as easy as other reviews say it is to fold up.  I have a SUV so it has not been a problem, but I must say for me it does not fold flat at all and I am not sure it would fit into a trunk. But, most reviews have have said it folds easy. Not sure what I am missing, but..
You'll never mistake the Shake flashlight for a powerful spotlight, but that's not it's purpose.  It's a niche item, the perfect flashlight to stick in your car trunk or emergency bag and then forget about it.  With no batteries or bulbs, you know it'll always be ready for use whenever you need it. ---  --- When it first arrives, you'll need to shake it hard for a couple minutes to charge it up, but just think of it as aerobic exercise.  Once it's charged, it provides sufficient light to read instructions or maps, determine colors of wires or diagrams, and keep you from stumbling around in the dark.  I was surprised by just how bright the Shake flashlight was after about 3 minutes of hard shaking.  The only improvement I can think of would be to have a small diode glow when the flashlight is turned off.  When the light begins to dim, a few shakes will keep the light strong enough to use. ---  --- Unlike the previous reviewer, I had absolutely no problems with delivery - I ordered it on 12/26 (non-expedited mail) and it arrived on 12/30, exactly as described
i love danielle steel! i`ve read ALL of her books so far.but secrets was a big disappointment to me.as far as i am concerned,ms.steel tried to change her style of writing in this book more to the kind of judith krantz or jackie collins (some explicit "parts" i didn`t like at all).simply NOT the danielle steel we like. the story itselfs is ok(gives the readers some "insights" behind the scenes of hollywood)but.... --- some of her books i`ve read over and over again. i am not going to touch secrets for a second time,however
The product does everything they claim save one. It won't work inside  Windows XP (service pack 2). But it will work when you boot from the disk. That isn't a problem in my view. Therefore I have no complaints
we needed a ruch delivery for our vacation of some quality water shoes with a decent price, we were treated superbly. our order took less than 3 full days to arrive. we will use amazon again to fine deals and service like this
I placed the order on Feb 28, but did not receive the package even on April 12. I called the customer service, and was told that the item has never been shippped, while I do not receive any information about that. Moreover the customer service even don't bother to say SORRY
I bought this for my wife who has many food allergies. She cannot have wheat or items containg gluten.  This is one of the best products I have found. Its crunchy and tastes great. It seems that most things we buy for her lack one thing or another, this product has it all.  I even like it. She absoultely loved it and I am out of the dog house.....for as long as it lasts..
The fisheye lens is a lot of fun, and I enjoy using mine.  However, I find that the practicality of the lens is minimal.  I don't usually want my "serious" photographs to have fisheye distortion. ---  --- I don't tend to like the 1.6x crop on Canon's lower-end digital SLR cameras, but with the fisheye this has an interesting benefit:  it's reasonably easy to use the fisheye as a standard wide-angle lens, since most of the distortion is removed by the 1.6x crop.  You can still get distortion, but it's a lot easier to compose a shot without it using a 1.6x camera than a full-frame camera. ---  --- Either way, lots of fun.  Buy one for the enjoyment, or even for professional assignments if your work calls for it, but think about if you really want the distortion before getting one of these
While the Everio will work on a Mac, it is with JVC's movie program.  It is not iMovie ready.  There is a very strange "work around" involving DVDrop that will make it work.  Not very pleased with what I feel is misleading information about compatibility with Mac
As with all the leap frog products, this ones a lot of fun. Packed full of learning surprises. I have always felt that making learning fun and easy cuts down on the fact that it's 'work'. The Birthday Surprise is fun and full of rhyming words, that make little one want to learn. I have a hard time giving any leapfrog products anything but a 5 star rating, because of the quality in all their products. --- Learning last a lifetime, so get them started with fun friends from Leap Frog.
Great sound, low listening fatigue. This does not over-accentuate low frequncies, so if you're looking for overly booming bass, this is not it. Note that it's an "open" design, so that you will hear environmental noise pretty clearly - it will not keep outside noises out
Tastes very good in my oppinion and in the oppionons of two of my friends who tried this product too. Not exceptionally great (hence the 4 stars) but good enough to enjoy eating. Big pieces of meat and plenty of it. Plus it's all natural including the beef which was not from hormone-fed cows, which is also important in my oppinion. Would buy again
I was so excited to buy this stroller. It seemed perfect for my 1 yr old daughter. The mesh back would be ideal for the hot, humid weather. It's light and easy to travel with. It seemed sturdy. Most of this was true until I used it for a month. Honestly, the seat is way too big! My daughter was forever uncomfortable b/c the straps were too loose even at their tightest to hold her and the seat was too deep. With minimal padding (and no recline) she would bump her head on the side frame when riding around. And to top it off, the frame bent after basic use. All we did was take it in and out of the car! I was very disappointed. Maybe this would be a great stroller for a 4 year old, but don't buy this stroller b/c you're looking for something smaller than your Graco(but better than an umbrella stroller) for your young toddler. I think for the price and minimal features it should be of better quality. Every review mentioned the carrying strap b/c that's the ONLY extra feature! This stroller was not for us! 
Be advised, this Software is for a SINGLE USER, only licensed for one computer. I bought this for Home use after using SS% for 2 years and V-Com said it would no longer be supported of 03/06. I installed it on 2 home computers, it worked fine for 4 weeks, then it popped up a Box on my second computer that I couls not use it because it was licensed on another computer, I needed to buy additional license for each computer. When I tried to use it on my Main computer, it popped up the same message. So now it will not work on either computer. I uninstalled it and sent it back. Just because it's Cheap does not mean it's any good
This magazine is great.  My daughter and I are doing projects together out of it every issue.  It's great also because it is training us to be creative on our own, and to try new things.  We also do these singing lesson Cds together- Vice Lessons To Go by Vaccarino- really fun, and have been doing Berlitz beginning Spanish Cds together.  We love choices beyond sitting and watching TV
What was John Singleton thinking.  I know he produces good films but this is far worse.  The Shaft from the 70s was sexier, cooler, more aggressive, and classer than Jackson.  This was a watered down verison where Parks and Roundtree made cameos.  It's almost to the point they take the blackness out of the character.  No love making and ect.  Don't even waist your time! If you want to see it, check it out on cable tv or something.  Save your money
Thirty five years ago my high school (Thomas Jefferson, in Federal Way, Washington) held annual competitions in mathematics.  They did it in the form of a test that came bound in a small white booklet, just was a few pages long.  There weren't many questions, perhaps a dozen or two (usually in the form of story problems), but they required deep thought and concentration (at least for me).  I still remember the feeling of excitement and trepidation as I took the "white book" and opened it to the first problem.  Several hours later I'd consider myself accomplished if I'd managed to completely answer more than half the questions.   ---  --- Ian Stewart's book reminds me of those tests.  Here's a sampling of what's inside: ---  --- 1)Mrs. Anne-Lida Worm decides she wants a new couch, and tells Mr. Worm to get it for her, while she goes shopping for a new tight for baby Wermintrude.  But Anne-Lina doesn't want just any couch.  She wants the biggest possible couch that can be carried down the hall in their house, and around the 90-degree hall at the end.  What shape does the couch have, and how big is it?  This is a truly riveting story.  Will Mr. Worm solve the couch problem in time?   ---  --- 2)Alberto wants to conduct tests on grapes, evaluating the influence of different soils.  He wants to conduct experiments to see how different soils and exposure to the sun affects the quality of wine.  His land is on a hillside, though, which is narrow, so he can plant only three varieties of grape on each plot of land.  How can he arrange things so that he tests all seven varieties of grapes when they are arranged so that each plot contains exactly three different species, where any two plots have exactly one variety in common, and any two varieties lie in exactly one common plot? ---  --- Sixteen chapters make up this book.  Though their titles are whimsical, the mathematical problems aren't.  Some are still unsolved.  Even though these problems fit in what would probably be called recreational mathematics, they are fiendishly cleaver with solutions, and developed insight along the way, that are at once challenging and rewarding.  Here's a sample of some of other topics discussed in Stewart's book: ---  --- How might one transport a lion, llama, and head of lettuce in a boat, across a lake, without leaving any two species where one might eat the other in the absence of a caretaker?  How can you calculate the temperature and entropy of a curve?  How can one even talk sensibly about a curve having temperature and entropy in the first place?  Suppose that you need to tile a room, and the tiles come in odd shapes.  Is there anyway to know if the tiling problem has a solution?  Can mathematics tell us things about evolution, such as whether or not evolution comes gradually or in spurts (or both)?   ---  --- This is a fun, lighthearted book, but the mathematical problems and puzzles it discusses will really make you think.  I enjoy reading as I exercise on my elliptical machine.  I get double the sense of accomplishment when I can read and workout at the same time.  Ordinarily, I can estimate how long I've been on the machine by how many pages I've read - 20 pages in 40 minutes is about average.  But with Stewart's book I had to be careful.  Several times I found that I'd worked out for an hour and only managed to cover half-a-dozen pages or so.   ---  --- If you love mathematics, particularly mathematical puzzles, then this is a book you'll really enjoy.  It has many problems for the reader, with answers at the back of each chapter.  If you do the problems and understand everything in the book, in detail, it will occupy many hours of your time.  All in deep thought and utter enjoyment.   
Both of our grandsons love getting SI for Kids.  It is a great way to introduce them to reading for fun
I would return this product if i thought it was worth my time and effort.  The 2.5 mm jack is slightly too small, creating a loose connection that ruins the experience of using it when doing anything active.  I tried both adapters (i bought the 2-pack) in two different devices and in all cases the connections was slightly loose.  In positive news, the connection at the 3.5 mm end is nicely snug
This sauce is medium heat for everyday use.  It has an excellent roasted pepper flavor, and there is *NO VINEGAR* to get in the way.  Consequently, you get exactly what one should expect from a pepper sauce...versatility and flavor that does not try to smother the character of the food you season with it. ---  --- An every-day sauce should not leave a patina on your tongue.  This is not a boutique novelty, it's a household staple.  The 32 oz. size is the right size for a hot sauce household. ---  --- You want good?  Try Tapatio on cottage cheese.  You'll never eat cottage cheese any other way again, I promise. ---  --- I use it on just about anything except cereal and ice cream, but my personal favorite applications of Tapatio are: ---  --- eggs --- potatoes --- pizza --- anything creole (forget tabasco!) --- cottage cheese --- most rice --- mac cheese --- and of course...Mex ---  --- In my opinion, this is the best sauce in your local grocery store
Not too long after I purchased this camera the screen turned white when I turned it on. I would turn it off and on and nothing would help. Finally I would take the batteries out and put them back in. This seemed to fix the problem a few times. After that I thought it was just operator error. But it wasn't. The camera finally gave out and the white screen never went away. So after being annoyed I left the camera alone for awhile. An event came up about a month later. I got my camera and tried to turn it on. Nothing happened. So I changed the batteries. Still nothing happened. I'm not sure what happened. I do believe I purchased a LEMON camera. I'm hoping to resolve these issues with Samsung. It was one of the cheapest cameras on the market at the time. So I guess you get what you pay for!
I needed extra space for pictures and musis downloads this was just right not too expensive and large enought to fit the purpose
MY TWO YEAR OLD SON GOT THIS POOH BEAR FOR A "BIRTH" GIFT.  HE BRINGS HIM EVERYWHERE.  IT'S GREAT BECAUSE IT DOESN'T TAKE UP MUCH ROOM.  HE HAS TWO NOW, BUT LET ME TELL YOU HE CAN TELL THEM APART!!!  THE TAG ON HIS "FIRST" ONE IS SLIGHTLY MORE WORN AFTER COUNTLESS WASHINGS AND HE LIKES THAT ONE BEST.  THE "OTHER ONE POOH BEAR" AS HE CALLS IT, WORKS ONLY IN EMERGENCIES.  MY 9 MO. OLD DAUGHTER IS GETTING THE PIGLET SINCE SHE LOVES THE POOH TOO BUT THERE WAS NO CHANCE OF MY SON GIVING ONE UP.  BUY THIS TOY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Love this new edition to Yatzee.  It is so handy to have the tray so your dice don't go flying everywhere.  This game is really a good game for the whole family
I've been to a lot of concerts, met a lot of bands, seen a lot of hype, seen a lot of scandal. This magazine is pretty much the best source of any up-and-coming band that you may be hearing on the radio or seeing on MTV. --- Not only is SPIN the best magazine for music for "kids my age (22)" but the picture quality is some of the best quality that I have seen in any magazine. I have framed pages out of previous spin magazines, because they were pictures I wanted to keep forever. I would recommend spin magazine to any fan of indie rock especially. Death cab for cutie, the shins, and the flamming lips are just some of the bands that are talked about in SPIN magazine monthly. SPIN magazine does include some rap/hip-hop music that I try to avoid but the indie-rock and rock band information that I receive is some of the best.
I really like my electric toothbrush from OralB so I thought I would like this too. However, it just doesn't work. The cartridges they have set up don't work because as soon as you tug on them at all, the floss becomes loose and therefore won't vibrate - it only vibrates if it's taut. But because of the way they have the cartridges set up, there is no way to make it taut again. It would have worked if instead they had used a roll of floss and let you feed it through yourself as needed, but they were too greedy and wanted to sell lots of cartridges. ---  --- This would be ok if you got lots of use out of the cartridges, but in my experience they broke halfway through a single use. So... forget it
It's more expensive than some, but it's well-made, works perfectly, and will last for years. Not requiring removal of the top to pour is great. Just buy it already
spalding gray is stream of consiousness on speed.  Over before you know it, you'll know a lot more when it's over
the cam is good...it has a special feature to show the person/object by automatic adjustment...and a very good part abt it is, it has a built in mike and helps a lot..
I remember going to great lengths to fit a matine showing of HEAVEN'S PRISONERS into a busy Saturday afternoon during its 1996 theatrical release. Considering the source material and the talent behind and in front of the camera, our little filmgoing party of detective-film fans and Alec Baldwin groupies (a.k.a. my mom, my stepfather, and me) found this contemporary film noir to be a big disappointment. Baldwin, who also served as co-producer, brought James Lee Burke's New Orleans ex-cop/recovering alcoholic hero Dave Robichoux from the printed page to the big screen. While Baldwin and the rest of the cast did well in fleshing out Burke's characters and have some tangy tough-guy/gal dialogue, they're hampered by two things:  ---  --- 1.) The film's slo-o-o-ow pacing. Maybe the Louisiana heat got to everyone, not just Baldwin. Of all the actors, Long Island native Baldwin sweats the most, so much that it began to remind me of the sweating-bullets gags with Albert Brooks in BROADCAST NEWS and Robert Hays in AIRPLANE!  ---  --- 2.) A plot that, as rendered in the film (whether it's the fault of the screenwriter or the editor, I can't be sure), never quite follows through on any of its elements. It's too bad, because these elements could've made for an exciting movie: drug dealing, illegal alien smuggling, rival crime bosses (one is played colorfully by Eric Roberts before he became a parody of himself, essentially playing a Southern-fried version of his character from director Phil Joanou's 1992 thriller FINAL ANALYSIS), an adorable little Salvadoran orphan girl (named "Alafair" by the Robichouxs, after Dave's mom. Late in my pregnancy at the time, I liked the name Alafair so much, I nearly changed my mind about naming my then-unborn daughter Siobhan!), and a bevy of beautiful, beguiling women, including earth mother Kelly Lynch, vampy Teri Hatcher in a full-frontal nude scene that was much ballyhooed at the time, and Mary Stuart Masterson, looking like a young Jessica Lange in what was then a change-of-pace role for her: a troubled stripper who loves Robichoux. Despite the sexy promises in the movie's ads, none of the ladies share anything with Baldwin but dialogue and some kisses and/or embraces. Maybe the climate was already so hot, the filmmakers didn't want to add any further steaminess for fear of poor Baldwin collapsing from heat prostration! As my mom put it at the time: "I thought the height of my day would be seeing sexy, dashing Alec Baldwin, but he came up sweaty, rumpled, tired, depressed, and moving as if he was in slow motion. If he'd made love as many times as he got beaten up, it would've been the sexiest picture of '96!"  ---  --- To be fair, there *are* a number of strong characterization and action scenes, but there's just too darn much talky, molasses-paced lag time between them -- and yet, oddly, some of the scenes end abruptly just as they're about to become intriguing! Perhaps Joanou, Baldwin & Co. could've dredged a tighter, more involving thriller out of this if they'd whittled the 140-minute running time down to 105 minutes or so. As HEAVEN'S PRISONERS is now...well, read James Lee Burke's books instead. --- 
This pilot is so bad, the acting, the writing, the directing, the costumes...  It's a miracle that B5 ever got even one season approved by the suits.  At least they could have gotten decent actors - pretty much, every character on this pilot is represented by a piss-poor actor.  And the writing is grade-school (I think this is what real people do) tripe. ---  --- HORRIBLE, ROTTEN, USELESS JUNK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
We wanted to purchase more traditional toys for our daughter for christmas 06.  We bought a lot of M&D toys and this by far was the better of their toys.  Even though our daughter is still a little young to put pieces together properly it will be even better when she figures this out.  Like other said the sound is very appropriate.  I like this toy and definitely recommend this to others. The only reason I gave it a 4 is colors on blocks could be a bit brighter or more colorful
Our first experience with a cargo carrier was over Christmas.  We were really counting on it and things worked great.  It is very spacious, easy to pack and stores nicely
The product works, but the software that claims to be windows compatible say's it is not when installing. Caused a lot of annoying delays when installing. Set system restore point before installing. Software hasn't caused any problems yet.
15 Minutes is worth the money.  It probably will not be the number one DVD in your collection, but you're sure to go back and watch it from time to time.  This film gives an interesting, if not frightening, look at the role mass-media play in our country's daily life.  We don't think about it, since we are living it... but this film gives us a view of someone who might not be used to the faced paced, 24-hour news cycle lifestyle that most of us live today.   --- At the center of the movie's plot is a greedy, slick breaking-news style anchor who is given the 'gift' of being the only personality in town to have the near-realtime footage of a string of murders, as they are being committed.  He has a moral pause, only for a second, before he unabashedly trumpets the news to the entire world.  The rest of the movie deals with the minds of the killers and the techniques used by the authorites to catch them.  All in all.. not the best movie out there.. but worth the money.
This Album Is not what I call a album First 4 trackz are the tightest with the tightest beats.  Best track on here is "I practice Looking Hard" probably one of the best trackz he eva made in his whole career I love that song but otha than that "Captain save a hoe" and "Mail Man" are a discrace. He shouldnt have even made this cd until he got more track
wow-  cheap plastic, poorly routed holes, took 1/2 an hour to finally reach the conclusion that the screws could not align properly due to bad construction - sent it back - my daughter loved the Dora picture and was very sad that she couldn't keep it
All Aerosoles have that extra aaaahhh when you wear them, and these are no different.  I've worn them with skirts, slacks and jeans, my daughter (teen) liked them so much that she bought herself a pair.  I liked my black pair so much that I bought them in brown also
I ordered this item several months ago and its yet to arrive
"Throughout India, chai wallahs can be found serving cups of decaffeinated chai to souls who naturally seek inner beauty at a slightly gentler pace."  ---  --- If you like your Chai with a peppery kick, then this tea will interest you. Rooibos, cinnamon, ginger, decaffeinated black tea, cardamom, ginger, chicory, cloves, star anise and other natural flavors seem to take a back seat to the delicious peppery flavor of this tea. This tea tastes similar to a tea I first tasted in Africa, where Rooibos tea is grown.  ---  --- Best served with milk/powdered milk/soy milk or a dash of cream and some honey. Since this is a decaffeinated tea, it is perfect for late night writing sessions or when you want something calming to drink that doesn't taste like chamomile.  ---  --- ~The Rebecca Revie
These Weebles are bigger then the ones that come with the box sets
I've never liked my lashes until I put this on. What a difference
Despite what it says on the Amazon web page AND what it says on the packaging itself, this does not fit my Genesis Stainless Steel Gold C Gas Grill purchased in April 2003 (it's about a half-inch too short).  ---  --- After finding out it didn't fit, I called Weber to find out what the deal is. After some checking and re-checking the Weber customer service rep said they don't sell the warm-up basket for my model of grill via retail outlets, and the only way to get it is from Weber directly. It cost a few dollars more but they didn't charge for shipping. ---  --- Fortunately Amazon's stelar customer service provided a prompt refund and did not charge me for return shipping;
This is a really great smelling colonge. Really fragrent but not in your face strong. I love to where this cologne before i go and do something really fun. Like going on a date or hanging with the guys, cause i really think that this colonge is lucky. There are plenty of times i was doing something mischevious and i swear i didn't get caught cause i was LUCKY :) get it? ---  --- I smells good and it is just like a rabbit foot with luck, pick some up!!!!
I bought a spare battery for my D70s and charged it up one time. Since then, I have been waiting to use my spare but the original (charged hundreds of pictures ago) has been going strong for, literally, months. ---  --- Follow the directions. Don't use it until your fully charge and don't recharge until it's run down. This will help maintain battery life. ---  --- Good product from a great company
I purchased Crazy Croc even after reading all the bad reviews, but my son really wanted it so I bought it for him for Christmas anyway.  It was the worst gift i've ever bought....please don't even waste your money....trust me, check the reviews first, now that's worth it...
Obviously, from all the reviews, this book appeals to many people.  I am not one of them.  Perhaps it's because I don't care for science fiction.  I found the writing stilted, the footnotes distracting to the point I stopped bothering with them, the story boring, and the ending (covered in the introduction) to be a Twilight Zone cliche.  If, like me, you want to read the book because it has some connection to bicycles and cycling you will be disapppointed. 
Fabulous marriage of convenience and quality. Rich, full flavor from the touch of a button! A dream come true
This is a nice case if you are looking for something compact.  I have a Kodak Easy Share digital camera and it fits perfect inside.  The case has a nice size front pouch and 2 side pouches for easy storage
I love Peterson's Guides, but the birds of Mexico is severely lacking.  The art certainly holds up to the standard set by the guides to North America, but unfortunately, it can only be considered complete if you tag along two other Peterson Guides.  Perhaps a good addition if you wish to complete your collection of Peterson Guides, but otherwise, buy Howell's or Edward's Guides, both of which far outshine this guide when considered alone.  Howell's is certainly the most complete, but Edward's guide is a bit handier in the field
foul. just plain foul. seemingly never-ending..and not in a good way. tasteless. sick. not even worth the beautiful faces. Heck, I can't even write a proper review because I refused to finish the worthless trash-couldn't tell you what it was about.
Ripping off King, but with more sex, shallower characters, and a Hollywood ending. Leave it on the shelf

Lord Clark's narration builds bridges over time and space, imparting an awareness of the breathtaking beauty of the priceless legacy that has been handed down to us.  Available now for the first time on video.  Civilisation was originally produced by the BBC in 35mm color, and is considered the standard-bearer for all TV documentaries.
I bought the Tourmaline hoping to save time, because I have very thick, wavy hair that takes 45 minutes to dry and straighten.  It ended up taking just as long, but the results were much better.  My hair was super straight and shiny, and it didn't get frizzy even in humid weather.  Then when I was using it for just the 4th time, it completely stopped working.  Just as other people described, the red light shut off and it cooled down, and never turned back on.  I'm in the process of trying to get a refund or replacement now. 
I RECIEVED THE ARACHNID ELECTRONIC DART BOARD AND IT LOOKED VERY CHEAP.  THE NUMBERS LOOKED LIKE A CHILD PUT STICKERS AROUND THE BOARD.  THE ENTIRE LEFT HALF OF THE BOARD WOULD NOT REGISTER THAT THOSE NUMBERS WERE HIT BY THE DARTS.  I BOUGHT A DIFFERENT DART BOARD FROM WALMART THAT WAS CHEAPER AND WAY NICER. 
Looks nothing like the image shown. 3 inches shy of even hitting the knee, let alone over it (and she isn't tall 5'5"). Keep looking....
I have been using the Family Tree Maker products for a number of years.  I love its ease in the ability to add new people into the genealogy charts.  I am a little disappointed in the change that moved the screen away from looking like a tabbed folder.  I feel that the old style was a lot more user friendly, both visually and functionally
This movie is my all time favorite. My friends and my sister enjoyed watching this movie and we watched it over and over.
This pillow has become my preganant wife's best freind.  She snuggles with this pillow way more than she snuggles with me
I bought this for one of my children but it is a bit heavy and too spongy, severly lacking speed.  I also bought the Stiga Champion which is lighter and faster.  I would spend $6 more and get a paddle which helps play instead of hindering it
I was actually surprised at how good the sound quality is from this iCrib sound system. It has very nice features like a 15min or 30min shutdown timer, so you can put the baby to bed with music and then the iCrib will shut down after the specified time. The nightlight is also really neat, as it cycles between four different colors. The only problem with this product is that it cannot run on AC, only on batteries, so we'll be buying lots of batteries over the next couple of years, but otherwise this is a great product. --- Edit--After further consideration I would drop the rating to 3 stars for two reasons. First, I have found the lack of an AC power source to be very inconvenient. Second, as the batteries wear down, the sound quality from the speakers deteriorates significantly
Every thing he sings is perfect, I've yet to find one song that doesn't move me.  This CD has some beauties.  "Daughter of Mine" is priceless.  "Steal Away" is very nice.  "One Small  Star" brings tears.  This arrangement of "Voyage" is  probably the best I've heard.  His traditional songs ("When you and I  were young Maggie" and "Mary of Argyle") are beautiful.  I  can't find anything on this CD I couldn't listen to for hours.  I truly  love music and listen to it constantly.  I find myself reaching for the  McDermott CD's almost exclusively.  I have them all, more please
I have never written a review, but in this case, I feel compelled to do so. I purchased the iMonitor last week as an upgrade to a Safety 1st dual monitor, for no other reason than I was tired of the interference. I was excited to learn of the digital technology, and once I got it home, I was anxious to try it. After a few nights trying it out, I was equally as anxious to return it and get my money back...let me explain: --- To begin with, before you buy, please be aware that the lights and sound are awfully bright and loud, which was troublesome since I am a light sleeper. I would have been able to deal with it, but there are other problems as well...there are 'clicks' and 'crackles' that are intermittent, and, like I said before, not good for a light sleeper.  --- The final straw was on the fourth night the parent receivers lost contact with the base -- I spent a half hour resetting it, reconfiguring the layout, powering on/off -- all to no avail. It kept beeping 'Out of Range' -- I was only 10 feet from the monitor at the time. Absolutely unacceptable.  --- In all fairness, we do have a lot of gadgets that are wireless and may have been competing with the monitor, but that isn't an excuse..it says 'Crystal Clear Clarity' and '2000 foot range', but this is not, I repeat, NOT the case. --- So, I packed it back up and went into Babies R Us to return it...here's the kicker: The salesperson at the store said that she agreed they had a lot of problems and she has seen more of the iMonitors returned than any other monitor. She rec'd the Sony, but it doesn't come with two parent units, so I have resigned myself to living with the Safety 1st..even with all of its interference, it is still superior, and 1/4 of the price as the iMonitor.  --- I have no doubt that Digital is the next step in baby monitors...but so far Graco does not have it figured out...Save your money and give it some time so they can work out the obvious flaws in the system.
Out of all the department stores here, I got a recommendation to choose the titan over the triumph, for the easness. It got noted as lighter and easier to deal with. I secound the so far so good comment earlier.. Its comfortable than most seats I have shopped for besides the #1 Britax that I have yet to experience:) --- 
This is my all-time favorite perfume, BAR NONE! I get millions of compliments when I wear it; most people think it smells like baking cookies or marshmallows - but not a little girl scent - definitely a grown up girl scent. Men love it because it smells like food - a definite turn on! LOL :) --- You truly cannot go wrong with this perfume, it is absolutely faboo
Paul Johnson has written a 1,000-page book about various and sundry aspects of the years 1815-1830, years in which he rightly claims to find the origins of many aspects of the world as we know it today.  Johnson's chosen foci are certainly broad: he ranges from events in politics and law to music, science, and even opium use.  While almost every page is loaded with fascinating morsels of information that will certainly come in handy when you want to impress people at your next social function, Johnson's roving eye and pen can be disconcerting: he tends to shift topics very quickly and without warning.  Also, while the book claims to be about "world society," Johnson spends the largest part of his time talking about British society -- but he's found plenty of ways to range geographically from the "western" United States (like Kentucky) to China and Singapore.  Throughout, his prose is generally crisp and pleasant to read.   ---  --- Overall, Johnson has given us what might be the ultimate in bedtime reading: a vast book that one can pick up, open nearly at random, and learn something interesting about the past but which retains significance today
I am enjoying the sneakers this Summer.  Comfy & perfect for elliptical trainer, stationery bike and weight room.  Very stylish, I love Skechers footwear
Practical, sage advice from Stanley. Not as good as his follow up, "The Millionaire Mind" this book is somewhat pedantic. It also suffers from the fact it's extremely dry. The author's writing is much more engaging in his followup, and that's a much faster read.  ---  ---  In addition to offering some practical tips "The Millionaire Next Door" also lends itself to parody in books like dave Barry's Money Secrets, a book called "Maybe Life's Just Not that Into You" and something from Andy Borowitz, the name of which escapes me.  ---  --- If you have to choose between "The Millionaire Next Door" and "The Millionaire Mind" go with the latter. 
Dare I need tell you how greatly this softcore, action thriller sucks?  Ok.  You might think there are two reasons (besides those two) to rent this: Nudity and Hilariously bad acting.  Well, there is nudity, but not as much as you think.  If you're getting it for Anna's naked flesh, be prepared to be more acquainted with your fast forward button.  She's nude, don't get me wrong, in the shower, in the bed, etc., but after that first scene, she is clothed and trying to act for a loooong time before the next scene.  Her "acting" is probably good if you compare to how she acts on her TV show.  she at least doesn't seem stoned. There is a plot that involves...just kidding, I have no idea!  There are some actual actors and a Travolta sibling playing your typical mobsters found in these movies.  The movie only still exists because of Anna being naked in it and there is nowhere near enough of it to make "To the Limit" more than a free rental, if that. I should mention that this is a review for the R rated version.  I don't know if there is an unrated version, but it would have to be better than this.  For more nudity, bad acting, and a less coherent Anna, go rent "Skyscraper"
I bought this CD six months ago because I am a Miami Vice fan.  I didn't expect it to be good, but it is wonderful.  "In Dulce Decorum" is incredible!  This is a hard-to-find CD.  You will love it!  I enjoy it more  with each playing
this one came out in '91. its one of the very few albums that included the almighty Joe Preston on bass. one of the great things about this CD is that all the songs are all on one track. so it forces you to listen to this long, winding, sludgefest in its entirety. as most Melvins fans know, this (along with Houdini) was the pinacle of their musical career. after this, they made some great albums and some good ones, but never better than their self-titled album (previously titled "Lysol", but they decided to change it once they were threatened with a lawsuit). it would be ultra-cool if Ipecac records would give this album a deluxe re-issue treatment. it definitely deserves it
Have been using this for a couple of days now and sorely disappointed. If you move the compass (of your own choice or it falls off the windshield), you need to recalibrate it. I've been sitting at stop lights and seen a 10º swing of direction. I have no intention of keeping this because of its lack of user friendliness
They are messy when they opened. I get milk on my hands and they cost way too much. I don't have much room in my freezer. when you buy the refills you have to purchase the tops and the containers seperate... it's like $17 for ten :-
This is not the usual quality that Playhut stands for.  The tent is held up by one plastic-corded pole that won't keep the tent upright.  My daughter gets trapped in it as it collapses.  The slumber bag is pretty, but the tent/tunnel is useless
This is a great bike.  I gave one to my 2 and4 year old to share for Christmas.  It is winter here so they ride it through the house all the time.  My son has really struggled with 2 wheel bikes because the typical bike easily crashes when you turn the handle bars too hard.  This bike is made so the turning radius is very small. The bike is light enough that he just picks it up a little to make a big turn.  No problem. He goes sailing through the house now with NO crashing.  Once the weather is good enough to go outside he is going to have a ball.  He will definately graduate to a standard bike after this teaches him balance.  He should be able to skip the obnoxious training wheels altogether.    --- My short 2 year old loves it but she has to go slowly because she can barely reach the floor.  In a few months she should be fine and I'm guessing by this summer she'll be sailing on it.   GREAT FUN.   Unfortunately the price is very hard to swallow.  I found one on sale through a design website so I could manage it.   If the money won't bankrupt your budget or you can save for it, it's worth it
This salt is very good. I have purchased other flavored salts from this company and I have been very happy with service and quality.  I will continue to use this company
I bought this Cd yesterday and I immediatly knew it was going to rock! After hearing the title track,Go!, I knew this Cd was going to be different then the Spice Girls Cds. It is better. My favorite songs are Never Be The Same Again,Ga Ga,and Goin Down.
Not only does this stuff taste wonderful, but it's much healthier than most of the items on the grocery store shelves.  I would definitely recommend this as a great snack
My husband received this DVD for his birthday. My husband grew up with the Pittsburg Steelers and still today is a true fan. As a family we all sat and watched this wonderful DVD on the Steelers and all of us enjoyed it very much. It goes back to the begining of time for the Steelers, it shows the superbowls and how the steel curtin got it's name. If you love the steelers then this 2 DVD set is a must have. You will not be disappointed
We had a simpler and earlier Quercetti marble run.  This was an upgrade/add-on, and well worth it.  The motorized elevator keeps the action going.  A five year old will need help setting up, but can operate the final run easily.  Safe pieces, easy construction and good directions.  Fun, even for the adults
I got this product as a gift at a baby shower and wasn't sure how I was going to use it--I was a little unclear as to exactly what it was. . .is it soap? (no) is it astringent? (no) what the heck is it?  Answer:  it's a baby Windex! I have used this going on 4 years and 2 babies.  It removes any lingering stink from diaper changes, cleans spit-up off skin and leaves a nice fresh scent, removes macaroni and cheese and chee-tos from hands and faces, not to mention kool-aid, chocolate, spaghetti sauce residue. . .you name it, Physiobebe cleans it up.  Just pump some onto a cotton pad, wipe, or napkin, and clean off your kid.  I highly recommend it
I have liked other Hot Pockets, like the ham and cheese is not bad if you spread some mustard on them but I think they over spiced the Pizza Hot Pockets. They taste kind of strong and weird
The leather case has a magnetc latch, the magnetic force is strong enough for an SD card to stick onto it.  I have not lost any images yet and the camera has not gone haywire, but I decided not to chance it. I am surprised that Canon cautions against placing the camera in Strong magnetic fields in their user guide yet produce an accesory with this feature! ---  --- Although constructed of fine leather, the case is also very bulky, making the tiny slim elph twice as thick and too big to fit into a pocket or purse. ---  --- The neck strap is OK, it looks metallic but is wrapped inside a clear plastic tubing, making it look quite cheap and stiff, again increasing the bulk of the camera. ---  --- The battery works fine, but the two other accessories are not worth the extra money
it was a little expensive but well worth it. --- it lasts allday long or several teapot
I remember watching Anne of Green Gables when I was a little girl with my sister, over and over again. Laughing everytime Anne broke her slate on Gilberts head, or when she accidently dyed her hair green, or when she waxes poetic about her "bosom friend". It made me smile and laugh then and still does now as a 25 year old. I would recommend this movie for anyone young or old. It is a beautiful heartwarming movie, with gorgeous scenery, unforgettable characters, and plenty of moments to laugh and cry
Of all the Karaoke games we have used, this is by far the best.  It's fun to pick out all of the different outfits for the characters.  It has more songs than the previous karaoke game we have.  THere are the are different options, like duets and in sing offs you can see who can get the best score.  Hours of FUN, FUN, FUN!!
This game was originally released for 10 dollars. Almost everything about it is pulled straight from Diablo and is not quite as good. Though this game has a few things about it that are interesting, and can be enjoyable to some people, I would just skip this game and go for Diablo 2
Our 8-month-old daughter outgrew her infant carrier, and we needed a "big girl" car seat immediately.  I knew that we were going to purchase a car seat made by Britax because they are always consistently highly rated in crash tests and by other safety measures.  After reading reviews and checking out the Roundabout, Marathon and Boulevard seats in the store, we decided on the Boulevard.  I love the added protection the side-impact wings provide.  True, it is just about the most expensive car seat out there, but I believe it is well worth the price. ---  --- The only drawback was that I found none of the fabric options particuarly appealing.  I finally settled on Brownstone because I believe it to be the least dreadful of them all.  I was surprised to find that it is not as bad as I had imagined.  It is extremely soft (almost has a chenille-like feel) and does not get too hot (even in direct sunlight).  There is also the option of ordering different covers, if I tire of this one. ---  --- This car seat is pretty big, but it fits just fine in our Honda Accord (in the  middle of the back seat), and two normal-size people can easily fit on either side.  It was very easy to install using the LATCH system.  I have not had any problems or complaints. ---  --- My daughter seems very comfortable in her new car seat, and I feel safe with her in it
I'm a big fan of Colin Firth and I was disappointed of this movie, I felt sleep, wish I never do on an average good movie, I do not recommended if you've seen Bridget Jones diaries, not even close..
I received my order promptly.  The harmonica was just as good as that instrument has always been.  I would highly recommend the product and the seller
I would just like to tell everyone who didn't understand the use of this item...They aren't actually anti-gravity boots!  They are used for a type of exercise called inversion where you put the boots on and attatch them to a bar hanging either from a wall or cieling, so in other words, you hang upside down with these boots while attatched to a bar.  They are in no way meant to make you float, or fly, or anything else that can only be found in sci-fi magazines..
If you're just mixing non-gas-forming drink mixes, this thing works acceptably well, but if you're mixing something like "Ionic Fizz" magnesium drink that fizzes up a bit, it's not very useful because it just doesn't form a very good seal, no matter how tightly you close it. As another reviewer mentioned, it's very easy to cross-thread the lid.  Thicker threads and deeper threads would probably help. ---  --- It is great for sipping though, and easy enough to keep clean. But I went back to using a plastic 16-oz milk bottle that always forms a tight seal when you close it. The seal on this bottle is too flaky because it's difficult to tell if you've cross-threaded it until you start shaking it.  ---  --- I'd have expected a bottle designed for shaking and mixing drinks would have paid a little more attention to the problems this has. I don't use this any more, because it's too annoying to worry about the seal and the cross-threading. Don't waste your money on it.
I reluctantly gave this superb film 5 stars not because of any shortcomings in the script or the acting-both are unbelievebly good-but because of what the studio had done to the movie. ---  ---  It was originally released at over 3 hours in lenght. When exhibitors demanded that it be shortened Warner's obliged by cutting it to 154 minutes. In the early 1980s the studio realized what it really had, and set about reconstructing and restoring the movie. ---  Because of initial sloppiness (footage being thrown out), it became impossible to fully reconstruct the film. The result is that there is a segment of some 7 minutes of stills about one hour into the picture trying to restore some of the lost scenes. Gone, too, apparently. is Vicki Lester's screen test. ---  --- All of this aside, what the viewer sees on the 1999 digitally restored DVD is superb. The color correction of the nearly 20 minutes it was possible to restore is excellent. The actors' performances are outstanding. Not only is Garland a superb singer and dancer,but the close intimate scenes with Mason radiate a warmth and tenderness rarely captured on film. Mason, too, is superb as Norman Maine. When drunk, his character is absolutely dispicable-becoming phisical and violent. Great, too, is the supporting cast.Jack Carson as the studio publicist Libby plays the role with much more profesionalialism and less corniness than his counterpart Lionel Streater did in 1937. ---  --- This is, by far, the best version of the film and well worth owning and viewing- dispite the minor shortcomings of its reconstruction.There is not one corny word of dialog in the Moss Hart script
It was impossible to find baby sunglasses in the winter until I found these stunning red infant shades.  A plus was there is a soft strap to keep the sunglasses on.  Our granddaughter looks like a movie star
Product is not worth the money. Made the bassinet very unstable
This is not the health magazine you'd expect from Martha Stewart -- it's extremely heavy on advertisements (45% at my rough count), and really cluttered, and just not "good". The recipes are interesting,  if you can find them among the aromatherapy and skin-hydration ads
I couldn't count how many copies of this book I have purchased.  The most recent was for my third grandchild due later this month. This book is the best there is for the very young child. For each of my own three children, it was a stand-out favorite that was read over and over until overuse required it be replaced. We certainly couldn't be without a copy! Since then, this book is always included whenever I give gifts to new parents.  --- The book is the touchy-feely type so the child explores the soft fur of the bunny, Daddy's scratchy beard, etc.  The only times I hesitated buying it for a new baby was once when the mom was unwed and the father was not involved with her or the child (there is a page on Daddy's beard and one for mother's ring) and another time for a family of color since parents in the book are Caucasian. 
I was surprised at the quality. The bracelet and necklace matched perfectly. It was a great gift for my 23-year old daughter. She loved them
My local Sam's Club discontinued the Nature's Path maple and brown sugar instant oatmeal due to lack of sales. I was bummed and did not want to resort to the highly processed Quaker instants - ick! Not to mention I'm tired of all the junk ingredients in mainstream food nowadays. Then I remembered Amazon selling a lot of easily shippable, bulk foods - including organics! :-) ---  --- The Nature's Path oatmeal absorbs water much better and the texture is heartier than other leading brands. It is also very flavorful. The variety pack is nice, since I used to tire of the Sam's Club selection of maple and brown sugar only. My kids love steel cut oats with a little pure maple syrup, but it's not the most convenient breakfast food. The Nature's Path instant oatmeal is quick and easy during the busy weekday mornings. And best of all, I can understand the ingredients label without having to take a chemistry refresher class. ---  --- I'm very satisfied with my first organic purchase from Amazon. We now peruse the selection of organic foods on Amazon before making local purchases
I am kind of a shortwave junkie, and have a few radios all over the place, --- I must admit that for the money spent, and the performance and endurance, this little bugger is probably my best buy!  I cannot believe the sound quality or the reception, its phenominal!  I can pick up shortwave inside the meat packing plant where I work!  (Big heavy steel freezers) It is a simple, small no frills, pocket size radio, but it blows away anything in its price range, trust me
O'Hara is one of the most underrated of American writers. _Rage to Live_  builds a strong character in Grace Caldwell Tate-- her passions are handled  with delicacy and skill and her story is told with a rare combination of  affection and judgement. A good place to begin with O'Hara if you don't  know his work already
I purchased this as a birthday gift for my 11 year old grandson. I knew it would be a hit as my son had received it as a gift from his grandparents as a child and was entertained for hours with it. It did not lose it's charm for 11 year old boys through the years. My grandson was thrilled with it as well. Just enough challenge to keep their interest
Overall this is a well-designed case which is custom fit for your Panasonic LX1 or LX2 camera, but it has a few major flaws.  First, there is no simple way to attach it to your belt.  There is a belt loop on the back but it is so small and tight that it won't fit any belt more than 1/2" wide.  Also, there are two zippers on this case, one on each side, which could potentially scratch your camera coming in or out of the pocket.  Finally, the velcro tab that  closes the case is not particularly strong and can occassionally pop loose on its own.  This might be a good case if you are going to keep it in your backpack or suitcase, but not for carrying around for everyday use. 
You can buy a subscription to the bimonthly "Audubon" magazine, but the best way to get it is as a benefit derived from joining the National Audubon Society (currently $35/year).  Conservation is a central theme of this magazine, but it also has lots of gorgeous photographs of sandhill cranes, snowflakes, caribou, and everything else that you might expect from a nature magazine, although the articles tend toward pessimism ('grim realism' some might say.) ---  --- There are also lots and lots of ads for people who would like to go eco-touring or birding in exotic locales.  I learned to my dismay that I'm not even classified as a birder because I've never traveled somewhere to see a particular bird.  I'm just a humble birdwatcher who tries to identify the avian species that show up at our feeders (everything from wild turkeys to ruby-throated humming birds.) ---  --- On the pessimistic side, the March-April 2005 issue of "Audubon" has warnings about global warming (which might affect the fertility of leopard geckos), Easter ducklings that parents buy for their children, then drop off in the local pond when they get too big (most breeds of domestic ducks and geese can't fly.  Basically the unwanted ducks sit in the pond and starve), the over-harvesting of dead wood in European forests (Bechstein's bat nests in dead wood), and the American eel, which has to run the gauntlet of "bait hunters, turbines, and spillways...in a constant battle to hold its own." ---  --- There are some bright spots, too:  the red-tailed hawk known as 'Pale Male' is holding its own in New York City, along with its mate, Lola.  'Freecycling' on the internet has "inspired more than half a million people to keep their junk out of landfills"--I thought this was going to be an article about E-Bay, but 'freecycling' is something different.  It's more of an 'adoption agency' than an auction site.  If you're interested in 'freecycling' your extra firewood or an outdated computer, check out the website at freecycling.org.  ---  --- Anyone who is interested in birding, or the state of the world's ecology would do well to join the National Audubon Society.  Your membership fee will help in the fight to protect endangered environments and species, and you'll get this interesting magazine as a side benefit.                                
This product is not very good. The speed registers at least 6 miles per hour faster than radar gun. Getting the grip on the ball correct to make it even register a speed is difficult and frustrating. Avoid this ball
Yes it is pricey but worth it. ---  --- I tried the Gilette skin care and liked it. At that point, $5 bucks for 1.7 ounces felt crazy. So when I bought this I thought I must be mad. But for my skin it works fantastic. It also has the distinct advantage of how it dispenses. You get a controlled amount unlike a tube by pressing down on the top. Yes you can not see how much is left. But I have had tubes that are not clear and you are in the same boat. At least here you have the best possible non-clear dispenser you could get. ---  --- I have always had good skin so I do not need that much to have good results. It is not greasy nor does it have much of a fragerence. It leaves my skin feeling smooth and has made shaving easier and smoother. Probably the Q10 is a bunch of hype. And yes I usually buy Sauve or 'Swiss formula' which are much less pricey. ---  --- I can get 2 months out of 1.7 ounces. Under $4 a month to feel great and help protect my skin? Worth it to me
We really enjoy the crackers, just did not realize that we would not be able to consume 12 boxes between the end of August, 2006 and the expiration date on the product of November 10, 2006. Feel that the 12 boxes would last at least 6 months before expiration when you purchase a case. ---  --- Amazon, needs to let the consumer know what the expiration date is so you can make decision as to whether to purchase a case or not. ---  --- Otherwise they are great crackers
I am writing this as a review of Hippo clubs in general.  I purchased a simmilar set from Amazon a year ago because it was a $300 set or irons reduced to $100.  I was interested in the graphite shafts (all I have ever used is steel) and wanted a cheap set to travel with (I have had 2 different sets of clubs lost during travel).   ---  --- The first thing that I noticed with these clubs was my miss-hits rose dramatically.  The clubs looked nice enough, but their performance was less than par.  When I talked with my club pro, he said that the problem with buying graphite shafted clubs that are inexpensive like these Hippos is that the shafts are cheap not consistant.  Your average pro plays with graphite shafts that cost up to $80 each.  He also indicated to me that high handicappers tend to buy cheap clubs (which was a humbling fact that I had to swallow), and that high handicappers tend to play better with steel shafts.   ---  --- All of this being said, I chalked up my $100 mistake and began looking locally at all of the golf shops for high-quality pre-owned clubs.  After 2 weeks, I found a hardly used set of '04 Big Berthas for $359.  I talked the salesman down to $299 and walked out with the best set of clubs that I have ever hit.  I guess my point is that if you are looking at these clubs, you are either a new or relatively unskilled player-- like me.  If this is the case, take some time and search out high-quality pre-owned or used equipment that will make your learning curve my shorter.  Let the golfers that get new clubs every two years spend $600-$1000 for new sets.  Take advantage of their trade-ins.  That's my opinion anyway
Growing up worshiping the sun had finally taken its toll on my skin. As of late I have noticed sun spots on my face, chest and hands (yuck!). My Esthetician recommended I try Murad's Age Spot and Pigment Lightening Gel. In about a month I noticed the spots beginning to fade! It is super light weight and soaks in fast too!  Now all I have to do is remember the sunscreen..
PROS: --- The blue topaz stone is beautiful with great quality and great cut. --- The white gold is a perfect choice to combine with the blue of the stone and the diamonds. --- CONS: --- the chain is kind small and thin. --- the diamonds are tiny with less than good quality. --- OVERALL: --- I am a pleased customer. --- I bought it as a gift for the Topaz stone not for the diamonds or the chain. --- By the way she looks stunning with this necklace ---  ---  ---  
There is absolutley nothing wrong with the car charger.  It works fine.  However the fm transmitter has 2 problems for me.  1 -- The connector is not long enough to connect through many of the protective cases made for Zune so you have to take it out of the case.  2 -- The signal is VERY WEAK and did not work for me in either of my cars.  I ended up buyin a cassette adapter which worked much better and there was a 100% better sound quality
I was a music director at a college radio station when this came out, and along with a ton of other albums this one commanded my attention.  --- Shoegazers??? I am sure all the label slinging yahoos are still wiping the egg off their faces. Its as if the band heard they were pigeonholed and gave them all the big finger.  --- Just buy it...and all the rest
I am finding the batteries are doing better than most rechargeables I have bought.  Seem to have a good battery life.  No leaking problems.  If I did, I would just return
When the room temperature hot and no one else wants the Air Conditioner turned on, this Desktop Air Conditioner cools just my 7 feet by 7 feet personal space.  It's heaven.  I wouldn't be without. This is my second order
Complete waste of money!  I bought this for my 5yr old daugther and there is no way possible for her to program it!  After several frustrating attempts we finally get it programed.  Now the darn thing does not respond to her answers.  Even when I clearly repeat the answer in her ear she does not seem to register.  Complete waste of Money!!!!  Would not recommend to anyone!  Save your money and play with a rock, much more fun
I would spend a little more money and buy a better quality camera. The picture quality was not good at all. I previously owned another Kodak camera with the same Megapixels and the picture quality on that camera was much better. Just after a year of using the Kodak C300 camera, it stopped working and I did not use it that much. I now own the Sony Cybershot DSC-W50 that takes great pictures, I haven't had any problems with it and I have been using it on an almost daily basis since May 2006
Great product, works well and was shipped promptly also there was an accurate product description....Thank
This toy looks very appealing. I purchased this for my son, 16 months at the time thinking it would be a great toy to stash in the kitchen cupboard so he could play while I cooked cleaned etc. He played with it about 4 times total and he's 2 now! It doesn't do enough and does have much other than a shape sorter. I consider it wasted money but if my experience helps anyone I'm glad
I went into this a pretty big Golden Smog fan eager for a new effort from the guys.  With Tweedy's songwriting having taken a great upward swing in recent years and with Louris' departure from the Jayhawks, I was hoping we'd see a few more Tweedy gems and some great tunes from the past few years since Louris' "Rainy Day Music" was released. ---  --- Now, while there are some really good songs here, nothing really comes close to the "Red-Headed Stepchilds," "Radio Kings," or "Jennifer Save Mes."  The album lacks something but I can't put my finger on it.  It almost sounds like a band that has too MUCH focus.  Considering Golden Smog started as a buncha musician friends sitting around, drinking beer, and goofing off, this album feels wrong.  It doesn't have that sing-along feel (with the exception of possibly one or two songs) that the first couple albums (and even EP) had. ---  --- Just a little lackluster and, considering the amount of Louris has his hand in on this one, almost comes off as an album of Jayhawks throw-aways
    I am a low income disabled person and require copious amounts of bathroom reading material, 'Wired' is even too tedious to fill that need. Its sponsors tend to run the lengthy ads reminiscent of old picture filled National Geographics of questionable scientific value. On the other hand the articles, for example in the latest issue, 'Are Higher Gas Prices Good for Us'(paraphrase of title) offer little information and if I had time to do the research this one is particularly like a sheaf of 1970 Nixon press releases in conjunction with the announced Operation Independance. The intention at the time was to free the U.S. from dependance on foriegn oil.  ---      Oh we of short memory, condemned to sacrifice our sons and now daughters!  ---      Of interest may be the dumb means by which I obtained an unending subscription to this and some other almost as pointless magazines, Playstation Magazine - now X Box Magazine, the completely amoral Men's Health, Garden Club, Cooking. I simply check the highest income level on every form I fill out on the internet and everything else short of a tax form or loan application.                                                       ---      Typical of something recieved for nothing  Wired  is not a publication for which I would recommend laying  out any money or time. Including bathroom time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ---  
In summary, Microsoft's software and T-Mobile's service have ruined a brilliant design (although with a couple of flaws) from HTC. ---  --- There are many pros and cons about this device and the service that it is shackled to.  I will break it down to Hardware, Software and Cell Phone Service Provider. ---  --- Hardware Pro's: --- A lot has been written about this aspect of the device, so I'll keep this to a minimum - The best form factor I've ever seen.  This device provides you the power of a Blackberry without the bulky hardware so I can put it in my pocket comfortably and not have to look like a geek with the belt holster. --- - A key selling point for me was the combined Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and quad-band connectivity that enabled me to connect a wireless headset, cruise web pages and have access to email when in the US or Europe. ---  --- - The phone quality is excellent. ---  --- - The keyboard layout is excellent and easy to use for medium sized emails. ---  --- - The battery life is great when Wi-Fi is not enabled and adequate when it is. (I've rarely struggled with a dying battery.)  Stand-by power management appears to be excellent. ---  --- - Charging of the device is very quick. ---  --- - The display, while a little small, is crystal clear and surprisingly easy to use given its size. ---  --- - The camera is pretty good and it's been really great emailing photo's to people as I'm traveling around. ---  --- [After all of the cons that you'll read below you'll wonder why I ever bought the device and why I still use it.  Well here it is: --- 1. T-Mobile locked me into a 2 year contract on a very expensive device. --- 2. It has great hardware that I can use in the US and Europe, I'm just hoping that Microsoft will finally get it right. ] ---  --- Hardware Con's ---  --- - The touch sensitive volume button is the most ill-conceived feature I've ever seen.  Even after playing around with various settings it is still hard to quickly set the volume at the desired level.  Even worse, when using the phone your ear or finger can inadvertently hit the control and randomly change the volume. ---  --- - The TI OMAP 850 at 201MHz is not beefy enough for the software that is loaded onto the device.  However, the blame could well be laid at Microsoft's door for writing inefficient code and having poor scheduling software between tasks and applications.  Either way, performance is very slow for some basic functions (see below) and I'm afraid some of the blame needs to be laid at the choice of processor. ---  --- Software Pro's --- - Not many that really come to mind. ---  --- Software Con's  --- (I hope you're sitting comfortably) ---  --- - When a call is on call waiting the phone fails to give an option to the user to select which call to take and which call to put on hold or drop/ignore.  On the occasions this problem has occurred with me the call that is dropped/kept appears random with a preference to switch to the incoming call no matter what is depressed.  The other call is dropped and not put on hold. ---  --- - When a call is incoming and the keyboard is locked, if the user depresses the green phone key the call is dropped.  This is extremely counter intuitive.  If the user presses anything other than the "answer" key the call is dropped and sometimes the call has been dropped even when I have depressed the "answer" key. ---  --- - The contacts database is extremely rudimentary with a very limited number of views and filters that can be used.  Even worse, upon selection, the contacts database takes between 5 and 8 seconds to open.  Now, I have what some would call a large database of contacts, but considering that the Palm OS version responded immediately with a far more sophisticated use model this excuse does not wash.  It's simply a poorly architected database. ---  --- - The user interface for entering a new contact is rudimentary (as are all dialog windows on this device.) ---  --- - One of the most annoying aspects of this device is the alarm clock.  The user interface looks like it was written in 10 minutes and was clearly not verified for correctness.  The digital watch I had in 1982 had the same degree of sophistication but with a more intuitive use model and was more thoroughly debugged. First of all, the user only gets to select a time and if the alarm is on or off.  From the interface you would assume you could only set a single alarm....if only it were that obvious.  The best way to explain this buggy piece of software is with an example: I set the alarm for 6am; the next day the alarm goes off at 6am.  That day I set the alarm for 7am - the following day the alarm goes off at 6am and 7am.  The next day I set the alarm for 7:30am and you guessed it, the alarm now goes off three times.  The best that I've been able to deduce (of course, this type of behavior is not documented in the user manual that comes with the device) is that the user has to actively select "off" for the current setting before setting "on" for the new time.  But there is no indication of what alarms are set, so after a while or a particularly busy week you can loose track of what's set and what isn't....the only way to clear all of the alarms that have been set is a hard re-boot. ---  --- - The calculator is a joke.  If this took an engineer 10 minutes to write they should be fired.  A calculator watch in the '80's had more sophisticated features.  The user interface is so bad it's hard to describe it in words.  ---  --- - Microsoft truly does not understand how a user would like to use the device and instead insists on using the same usage model that they've inflicted upon us since Windows 95.  Most features or function have to be navigated through the Start menu button.  Applications are nested and features are hidden behind several annoying menu selections.  Some features are simply hard to find, but should it really take so many menu selections to find common tools or applications? ---  --- - The use of alarms or reminders is ambiguous - to put the device in "Silent" mode, but leave alarms on because you want to sleep and only want your alarm to wake you up, for example, does not work.  Calendar reminders will be active as they are assigned the alarm property instead of their own or the notification property.  The only way around this is to cancel reminders for all day events....otherwise you get an alarm at midnight. ---  --- - So, on my Nokia phone a thousand years ago, when I went to Europe my phone would have a simple selection for the new frequency I needed once landed.  The phone would then automatically connect to the provider available.  It wasn't completely automatic, but the user interaction was simple and intuitive.  Not with the Dash.  First of all T-Mobile doesn't help by keeping a radio button on your online account that you have to select to enable international roaming.  The feature is free so why not add a selection anyway?  All you know when you get to your destination is that your phone won't connect to the local network no matter what you do.  Now, assuming that you worked this out, you are now faced with the challenge of actually connecting to the local provider's network.  On my Blackberry this was automatic, but of course with Microsoft there are selections to make, searches to activate and various other contortions that need to be gone through before you connect to the provider of choice.  Assuming that you get connected at all. ---  --- - ActiveSync: This is the most annoying piece of software in that it just does not work.  Worse still, when it does not work it gives a cryptic error message stating that an error has occurred and some data will be lost next time you perform synchronization.  It does not provide you with a fix, a hint or a path so that you don't lose data.  It does not even tell you the data that was lost.  So, I'm using a Microsoft Mobile OS with Microsoft XP and Microsoft Outlook and they can't get that right?  (OK, it maybe serves me right for signing up to so much Microsoft, but come on.)  This was another primary purchasing driver for me.  I am very busy and want to have my schedule up to date between my PC and PDA - all the time.  It's the only way to keep organized.  I thought that with the same provider of all the software I'd be OK.  Also, as this feature has been around for over a decade from Palm and perfected by Blackberry....how hard can it be? ---  --- There are probably annoying nits that I have with the software, but those are the major ones.  And they are major. ---  --- Considering this is Windows Mobile 5.0 what on earth were they doing for 1.0, 2.0, etc.? ---  --- Service Provider Pro ---  --- - T-Mobile is useful to me for traveling in Europe.  They have much better coverage over there than in the US (where I'm actually paying). ---  --- - Their package is competitive. ---  --- Service Provider Con: ---  --- - Coverage is not good enough.  I'm in San Francisco and I have dead spots in my house. ---  --- - Their back-end connectivity with your email providers is terribly buggy.  At random times you will get cryptic messages saying that you must have something wrong with your connection and emails can't be accessed.  But you know there's nothing wrong with your connection because you've been on the browser.  Also, there was a whole day that emails were not accessible.  Because of the many issues that I'd had with email set up and maintaining a connection I went through various debug routines wondering what had failed.  When I finally called technical support they told me that their service was down - no apology, no notification, no nothing.  Certainly no minutes to make up for the inconvenience.  (So, why didn't I call technical support earlier?  read below...) ---  --- - Their technical support structure is terrible.  I have collectively wasted over 12 hours of my life on their "help" line.  I'm not going to go into details as it would just take too long.  Bottom line, if you have a problem with your phone say "Dash" at the prompt and then ask for Tier Three Data support.  Everything you get before that is a waste of your time as the technicians you'll encounter have inadequate training.  If you are then put on hold and are given another number to dial - DO NOT DO IT - This cycles you back around to Tier Two Data Support and you have to go back to the back of the line for someone that understands the device. ---  --- So, should you buy it?  Wait until Windows Mobile 6.0 comes out at least.     Maybe another provider will pick up the device by that time. Then see what else is available
This one is just plain awful!!   It's a bunch of Hollywood brats being histrionic. 
its quite difficult to sum up the impact of this cd with few mere words. suffice to say, level 1 is a timeless classic, in fact, it was my entry pass into the realm of d-n-b. logical progressions level 1 is a must-have for all d-n-b heads & music lovers in general. demon's theme, western, danny's song & horizons remain some of my favorite songs in any genre. bukem's level 1 displays his flawless production & track mastery which cascades the listener with the ideal mid-tempo balance between dance-floor adrenaline & ambient bliss
My Japanese pen pal Y. Yamamoto just adores Strawberry Pocky and tells me they're lovely icebreakers in stressful situations. ---  --- Mind you, I'm not sure I should believe Yohko-chan as she describes these situations, many of which involve her flying a space battleship and using time travel in a remarkably casula way, but I must admit they're entertaining reading. and the souvenier she sent me from that space Hot Springs was rather interesting -- although why you would make crocodiles that are just like bananas is completely beyond me. ---  --- Still, I want to date her friend Ruuan. She looks hot, in an amazingly ditzy sort of way....
"Sleep with Me" would be completely worthless if not for a Quentin Tarantino cameo in which he riffs on the homosexual undertones of "Top Gun."  That lasts about two minutes.  The remainder of the film is just dull relationship philosophy spouted by pretentious, ersatz neo-Bohemian characters. Except for Tarantino's "Top Gun" bit (and the twenty seconds or so when Parker Posey has her shirt off) there's nothing worthwhile here
As a straight female I offer a unique perspective on this magazine.  I think it's totally hot.  I really like the fiction, and the guys are such cute young hotties!  Some of them look a little "mean" for my taste - they look so challengingly at you, instead of invitingly, but then again, a lot of guys in porn look this way to me - this is normal for porn I guess.  Very few, if any of them are over-beefed (too muscular), and some of them aren't muscular at all, which means nice variety.  The fiction is my favorite of all the gay mags I've looked at - lots of first times, nothing really bizarre or violent.  Overall a cool magazine
I really like this program. I have purchased three different Bible programs for my PDA and this one is by far the best of the three.
Unlike most of the other reviewers here, neither I nor my nine-year-old enjoyed this book. The premise is good, but the family-values morality is heavy-handed and the writing limps along
OK, it does get hot quickly.  But only when I can get it to turn on.  After about 6 months, the connection to the power switch became loose.  Now I have a hard time getting it to turn on.  I'm about to buy a different iron with a different type of switch
I bought it for my boyfriend for the gym.  He would carry all his extra gym clothes, wallet, keys, and phone all bundled up in his arms and shove everything in the locker dropping everything along the way.  He really likes it and especially the extra front pocket allows him to seperate small stuff. Not very many other products have that extra pocket.  Very sturdy material and the size is just right
It's a long read, the characters are boring, and the ending makes no sense at all.  It is neither funny nor thrilling. It's just plain dull
Be sure to catch the Alternate views on Disk 2.  The view from the control booth with the director losing his mind, in a good way, is great.  They also have A Beautiful Day from the rooftop in Boston
The best tasting lollipops, the fact they are organic is a huge plus. Our main focus in our house is to be free of chemical dyes and these fit the bill. They have been a hit with my kids and all the other children we have shared them with.  --- 
I am the type of person who only waxes our cars twice a year (I figure that's better than nothing). I want a wax that is easy to apply and provides lasting protection (mostly because I won't be applying it again for six months). ---  --- I used Black Magic a couple of months ago on our cars and I am thrilled with the results. ---  --- It was the easiest wax I have ever applied.  ---  --- And, two months later, both cars are still slippery as snot (I couldn't think of a better description). Dirt and grime wash off easily and reveal the great shine that I saw the day I applied the wax. ---  --- I highly recommend this wax
Excellent quality - the post is smooth and does not abrade the ear as some inexpensive earrings do.  The ball is smooth and shiny with no ripples, pits or other defects.  I am very happy with this purchase
I can't believe the harshness of some of the comments on this album.  Not a lot of in between among the notices -- those that hate are mean and heartless.  Very hurtful.  Lousy counterpoint to her warmth.  I don't think they understand that she doesn't have to lose control to be meaningful and touching.  Take her as an original instead of as a mimic.  What do I hear?  I love her lush voice on this album and Fred Hersch's brilliant piano accompaniment.  Bill Frisell is very good, too.  I love jazz & pop as well as opera.  Ren?e Fleming can make it any of these genres. These songs are very much her own interpretation.  They are 'deeper' than what you've heard before.  Even if I prefer Nancy Wilson or Eva Cassidy singing "You've Changed," Ren?e Fleming sings it warmly and beautifully, in her own style, and very touching, too.  She's not carried by full orchestration, mostly just Fred and her.  I was going to write that "My One and Only Love" was especially good, but as the cd kept playing, I must say that they are all especially good.  Enjoy
The display didn't work on the first rower we got, and one of the wheels on the front of it was broken.  Amazon sent out a new one the day I reported the problem, and helped me get UPS to pick up the damaged one.  The second rower arrived in good shape, and works fine.  The different programs are nice, it's extremely quiet, and my wife likes it better than the air rower we use at the Y.  The slightly padded seat is also a bonus.  One of the most important features for us was the heart rate monitor.  It comes with the chest strap, and displays heart rate on the LCD screen so you can vary your workout to stay in the target zone.  The heart rate monitor is not available on inexpensive rowers, and with some of the more expensive ones, you still have to buy the chest transducer separately.  Overall, quite satisfied with the rower, and because of their excellent customer service, extrememly satisfied with Amazon
I was livid when I saw this movie after reading the book. It is barely on course with the book. They could have done a much better job with that story. What a waste of good actors like Denzel and Salli Richardson.
Hi, I am writing this review in an attempt to help you save $10. This magazine is an embarrassment in every angle. It is full of pictures of "sexy" boys/men dressed in cloths no guy with self esteem would ever wear. And pictures is all there is, for you that think there will be something interesting to read, read this: THERE IS NOTHING IN THIS MAGAZINE TO READ!!! The latest issue contains of 48 (forty-eight) pages before you get to this issues contents. The first "article" starts on page 126 (!) and is about "why a man would like to slice of his testicles"! Totally the magazine contains of 260 pages and there is text (letters that forms sentences) on about 40 of them. Besides this, the magazine also has a huge dilemma of being a gay magazine or not.  --- Well I can go on and on but I won't. Unfortunately I have a subscription and I am going to see if I can get it canceled, I don't even need my money back. Take your $10 and run them in the disposal, it will be more fun to clean out the disposal than "read" this magazine
at a local guitar store i bought a planet rock guitar like this. it is a really great guitar and can play any kind of music. but the cables and guitar straps that came with it sucked. so i bought some more and they worked perfectly. about 5 monthes after i bought it the thing that attached to the guitar strap kept coming off. so i super-glued it and it works fine. for this guitar i recomend a levys leathers guitar strap. i have a rat fink "surf all day" guitar strap. if you are a beginner i recomend a beginner pack just like this. for this guitar green cable look good with it. if you want cooler picks than the ones on amazon.com i recomend going to hotpicksusa.com. take it fom me an innocent child buy it if you think it is the right thing to buy. but i like b.c. rick guitars way better than that one. but you can at least buy a guitar here to make mr. amazon happy. so do it
VHS - I have watched this over and over and LOVED every minute of it so much so I have now ordered the DVD I only wished the film could have lasted longer. I never worry about what other people think I prefer to make my own mind up and entirely disagree with the negative comments and will not let others spoil my enjoyment of the film whatsoever.  Make up your own mind and don't let others put you off!  I have all Jane Austen's BBC series but this is my FAVOURITE. --- Angie London Englan
We bought this pool toy for our daughter, and she was thrilled!!! But after being on this toy one time we now call him the bucking bull. Good luck staying on the silly thing. Now my child sits and hangs on to the handles and we pull her around the pool on it. My husband and I cannot stay on this thing either. Every now and then we bail on with sheer determination, only to be off in a matter of seconds
I have an R717 camera.  I bought the dock too.  Each one comes with a battery and the batteries look identical.  HP labels both as an R07 battery but the L1812A has squared edges running logitudinally and this feature makes it very difficult to remove from the camera.  The other battery is the L1812B and is identical in every way except its edges are rounded and that makes enough difference to allow it to easily slide out of the camera. I bought a "clone" battery (not HP) and its edges are rounded too.  Maybe HP could explain the difference.  Just thought you would like to know
These CliC glasses are a great idea... I first saw them on CSI-NY, and sought them out, but they are not made big enough... they worked fine as long as I was looking down, but as soon as I turned my head level, or looking up, the glasses would "pop" apart.  I had purchased two pair, and returned them both
I am not going to repeat other reviewers discussion of the lack of character development. ---  --- My issue is with the lack of basic research.  One incident has Hawke's Zodiac being fired upon by a French Patrol Boat's missile.  Bell uses the Harpoon missile as the weapon.  The French have their own very effective ship to ship missile in the Exocet.  Very unlikely that the French would use an American made Harpoon.  Later in the novel, Hawke is taking off from a carrier deck in the latest VTOL aircraft, the F-35.  The catapult fails and Hawke is put in grave danger.  My problem, this is a VTOL aircraft, which the author goes to great lengths to mention and describe.    Why would there be a "cat shot" at all.  VTOLs are designed for vertical takeoff and then transistion into level flight, which, again the author describes.  Also this scene has nothing to do with the story.  Just another "Saturday Cliff Hanger" episode. ---  --- This is my second attempt at a Ted Bell novel, ASSASIN being the first.  There are too many other writers out there than give a sense of believability for me to waste my time on this type of thriller.  I believe the author has the ability to create a very good novel.  I wish he would cast aside the unbelievable and go with something a little more creditable
Replacement blades are a must. The razor will remind you about once a year which is fine in most cases. But, if you have a heavy beard or shave more than once a day, as I do, then you should replace the blades every 8 months or so. The reminder on the razor is only a suggestion, not a command. After all, it does not know when the blades get dull. So, I simply ignore the reminder and replace the blades when I feel it is necessary. ---  --- One thing you must do is use the new blades for several days until they settle in and adjust to your skin. Until then you may have a little irritation. Another problem I have solved is the hair on my neck. I use to think the harder I press the razor, the better it would get those stray hairs. But, all I got was a rash. I discovered that if I simply use a very light touch and not press hard then it got those hairs much better and with no redness. ---  --- Replace your blades at least once a year and your face with thank you
While this DVD was obviously filmed in the early 1970s with the picture quality to match at times, the genius of David Bowie shines  through. As adults too young to remember or have seen Ziggy Stardust, it was an amazing look at the time period. The sound quality is suprisingly good, although some camera angles are distracting at times. It was also neat to hear Bowie's pronouncement of "This is our last tour ever." Little did he know... This DVD is worth every penny. Rock on
This is an item that I purchased from Amazon.com that I am not satisfied with.  I cannot install the game on my computer to play it.  I had a relative try to install it on her computer and she also could not install it to play.  She believes that it could be a damaged disk, and that I should pursue getting a refund or replacing it with another copy.  I hope you can help me with this.  Thank you for your support.

I inherited this product from my neightbor last week.  I have attempted to wash and clean it thoroughly before using it.  I cannot get the seat apart and it is incredibly dirty and moldy inbetween the seat and the swivel part.  Other reviewers have noted similar experiences but their seats broke when they tried to take it apart.  I would love to try this product, but as long as it is dirty and cannot be cleaned properly, it will not be used.  What a shame...baby products should be made so that they clean up easily
this ramp is terribly designed for a skateboard. First of all, i thought this would be a bit larger. When i tried to go off of the ramp, my nose hit the front of it.  --- Not only is it not fun, but you need to weigh it down if you dont want to slide around. If you are considering purchasing this item for use with a skateboard,i recommend something else.
Ordered these bra extenders since I an pregnant and now having trouble fitting into things, and they are working great!  Recevied them very quickly and they are exactly as I expected! Thanks!
I was surprised when I received what appeared to be a sales brochure. I searched carefully through the shipping materials to see if I had missed the book entirely, but in fact the small, clumsily put together manual was in fact the $3.75 book that I bought online. It has some new exercises in it, but most of what we needed to know came with the therabands in the little manual that ships with them.
This clock set itself within a few minutes and has worked well for the few months that we've had it. I loved not having to climb up and get it down to re-set it for daylight savings time! ---  --- Just so you know, this clock is not silver in color (I thought it was from the picture). It's more of a pearlized off-white
I thoroughly enjoyed playing Final Fantasy VIII.  From the introductory movie I was hooked.  The world and story were very unique, as well as the new battle system.  I thought the junction system was fairly easy to understand and once I got used to it, I loved it more than the materia system of VII.  The characters in VIII were all very likeable.  It was interesting to play the game from the perspective of a student named Squall, who happens to be one of my favorite heroes of the Final Fantasy series.   The cinematics in the game were very nicely produced and captured the best moments.  From start to finish, I had fun playing this game and highly recommend it to fans of the Final Fantasy series and role playing games in general.   
I really did enjoy reading this book, cover-to-cover. It's very touching and very informative. It will change your ideas about a lot of things. The writer along with other expert contributors have done a great job bringing out all of these real moving stories. I would recommend this book for every human being who cares about other fellow human beings
Good servive. faor price. this coffee could be a bit stronger to my tast
In short, I love it.  --- The XH A1 is a professional looking camera and has all the features you need. --- It is a bit complex for those who are not true prosumers or pros, and the manual is not consumer oriented. ---  --- The picture qualitity is, so far, the best I've seen in non-pro cameras. The 3 CCDs at 1/3 inch each are truely spectacular.  ---  ---  --- The 2 external XLR connections are the reason I looked at this camera. If you want to mic someone via wireless or wired lav mic, this is the camer to do that. Just make sure you read over the XLR connection settings in the manual a few times and change the buttons (unfortunately located in 4 different locations on the camera) to the right settings. A set of good headphones is a must-have when not using the wonderful built-in mic. By the way, this built-in mic eliminated one of the situations where I always needed a mic, a close up interview situation--the built-in is very sensitive and accurate for this type of thing. ---  --- The downside to this camera is really only that it does NOT contain an HDMI adapter. Sadly CANON did not provide one; instead they opted for a custom (HDMI-looking) adpater that if you loose the cable you can't run down to Fry's or Radio Shack to get another one. :( ---  --- The other thing is that it is 1440x1080 instead of 1920x1080.  Their new CANON HV20 ( a 1CCD camera due in April 2007) is 1920x1080 resolution--just seems odd to me.  But then I'm the guy that will get a 10 Megapixel camera simply because its better resolution. :) ---  --- The bottom line, don't get the Sony FX7, get this one. The Sony seems and is easier to use, but it doesn't have an external XLR jack, it uses 1/4 inch CCDs, and in a side-by-side test doesn't offer as good performance in low light situations as this one. ---  --- The camera is a bit complicated, but if you're willing to learn, it is a wonderful tool. --- If you need true point and shoot, I'd wait and get the CANON HV20
Bill Charlap is undoubtedly one of the most talented, lyrcially-blessed jazz pianiasts around today.  He has a deft touch and a senisbility that far exceeds his age and life experiences.  That told, I find it very hard to give his latest effort, Stardust, more than two stars.  With very few exceptions, I found this CD to be fairly self-indulgent and Charlap rather morose in his intrepretations. It wasn't nearly a refeshing to the ear as Written in the Stars.  I would recommend this for a Charlap devotee but no one else.  He has made better albums
I had purchased this two pack memory card and they are pretty good no problems with memory card
This new Maclaren stroller is fantastic! We just returned from three weeks in France with this great stroller.  It can roll down an aisle on an airplane and negotiate the rocks and bumps of any street. It is very light and we love the new shoulder strap.  I have 3 kids and this is the best stroller I have ever used
I did have to adjust my graphics acceleration to get the game to run smoothly, but it's a fantastic game.  ---  --- You get a building with your waiting room, exam room, living room, and bedroom. You build animal pens outside, buy medical equipment, buy books to learn about caring for each species, and need to manage your time to make sure you examine animals, sleep, eat, and for all animals that require a hospital stay you need to feed, care for, play with, and clean up after.  ---  --- It's a fun and well designed game
This carafe was initially perfect.  The design is attractive and simple, and it fits well in my bag in the mornings.  The problem then began that keeping liquids boiling hot would cause it to explode after being jostled in on my morning commute.   ---  --- I attempted to remedy this by cooling my morning coffee or tea in the morning, although I felt this was partially defeating the purpose of bringing in my own coffee or tea.  Then it became an issue that the liquid would either leak or shoot out of the carafe after being turned the slightest direction other than straight up.  I'd suggest saving yourself the trouble and tea stained clothes by buying a different carafe altogether
ASIDE FROM THE GROWER, DOLE, I CAN NOT BE MORE CPOMPLIMENTRY OF THE DEALER --- THAT HANDLED AND PACKED THE FRUIT AND VEGETABLES THAT RECEIVED FROM AMAZON. ALL OF IT WAS PICTURE PERFECT AND DELICIOUS. THIS IS AFTER A 3 DAY --- AIR SHIPMENT ACROSS THE COUNTRY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I ordered a pair and they were too big...so when I asked for a RMA number to return and get a smaller pair they said they could only snail mail me a UPS Lable... one month later it did not come... Each time to emailed customer services they said they could only smail mail it and not email it to me.... whereas I know it is do-able.. Bargain Outfitters can as well as can Online shoes .. So finally I paid $15 to send the boots back. on my dine.. and no doubt they will not reimburse me for my $.. I not only had to pay shipping to get the boots but also they will no doubt chaarge me a re-stocking fee.  I will never ever buy from The Sportsman's Guide again...
 --- I ordered this Dress on March 6th. I recevied an email from the company saying that it would ship by March 8th. On March 16th, I receive an email saying that they are out the size I wanted and my order has been canceled. This is unacceptable from a business. I should have been notified by March 9th that the dress had not been shipped. I have less than 24 hours to find a replacement dress. Thanks alot
Temperance Brennan is an American forensic anthropologist .The author is a anthropologist in real life and I feel she gave to much detail as to body parts & conditions ,& locations in the book , and in about the 3rd chapter to much time and space is wasted talking about "Gabby " including in detail where gabby lives and details that surround the outside of Gabbys place & How Gabby and Tempe were friends from GRad to man parts in life . Book was not for me I dropped it at the 3rd chapter .
Small...very small kit, not as advertised.  Every item needs expensive batteries  --- 
I think that this crib toy is awesome! Since my son was 3 months old we've turned it on every night at bedtime for him. He just watches the fishies swim around while the lights dance and the music plays. My son is now 7 months old and he still seems to like it.  And the cool thing is that now he is old enough to be able to interact with it.  If I switch it to manual MODE, he can turn on the music himself!  He can also play with the crackling feet and feel the silky material. Plus, he has another friend to keep him company in his crib (a big happy turtle with fish in his belly :-). Thus far, the straps haven't broken or cracked and I have removed it from the crib a couple of times. Also, the fish do swim around and the music does last for 15 minutes.  Its just a matter of which MODE you switch it to. (Reading the instructions really helps.) I strongly recommend this
Every single item, especially produce, that comes from Gristedes, is top notch.  If I need a particular fruit or vegetable for a special occasion, I know I can rely on them to provide the highest quality and best tasting fruits and veggies.  I was in hospital recently when a big order arrived and our grown children sat around and ate everything with Dad.  They just couldn't believe how good it was, they said.  Never tasted any red grapes that good.  It's that way with everything.   ---  --- I've read some negative reviews of Gristedes.  I don't know what happens to cause things to go South.  I can only say I would order my produce every week from them if I made the time to do it.  And it's not THAT expensive, because we're on a fixed income.  Just treat yourself to something special.  You won't regret it
The camera (Canon S-80) barely fits in the case and there is no room for even an extra storage card, much less a second battery pack or the charger. I ended up using my old Tamrac case that has an extra zippered pouch for accessories. Total waste of $$$
Ok, maybe that's a bit strong, but this is hands down our most hated toy (by the adults, and the kids are plenty frustrated, too).  We received it as a gift (and WOW whoever would pay $35 for this is CRAZY.).  Our son is nearly five & needs help to load the truck, which has to be loaded fully to work without jamming; a time-consuming procedure, since the dominoes have to be loaded one-at-a-time.  The dominoes themselves are also almost too lightweight to stand well on end, and are prone to easy collapse.  After the initial newness wears off this toy is going to disappear, and that's something I've never even contemplated before
Although I prefer the AKG K701 for most of my listening, this competing entry from Beyer is so close that it's almost a coin toss. (One recent comparison in a headphone artcle came up with a dead heat.)  ---  --- This is surprising, considering that the DT880 is one of the most reasonably priced of the major mid-priced headphones. The bass is full but nicely textured - not a touch of bass bloat to be found here. The highs are detaied and never seemed sharp to me, and the overall sound offers a huge soundstage. Instead of the music being on top of your, these Beyers lend a perceived distance of a few feet; ths makes classical music sound doubly elegant, and surprisingly makes rock music grandiose in an appealing kind of way.  ---  --- These headphones don't require a headphone amp, but certainly profit from one. The 30 ohm version makes for more volume, though the 250 ohm version is standard, and best for most daily listening.  ---  --- The DT880 sounds great, but lacks a tad of the K701's high-end sparkle. Conversely, Beyer's value, comfort, and workmanship can't help but impress. This is a phone that has labored under the shadow of the AKGs and the Senn 650s, but listeners are always impressed by the DT880s sound. It may be your best value in a mid-priced, all-purpose headphone
I like the philosophy line, but the Vanilla Birthday Cake body wash doesn't smell so much like birthday cake as it does bananas. --- The product is great though
I don't write many reviews, but this movie was just so pitifully lame that I felt it was my public duty to warn you about it. The fact that Amazon tries to bundle it with "House of 1,000 Corpses" must be some kind of joke! The dialogue and acting don't even rise to the standards of a made-for-TV movie. The cops don't look, talk, or act like cops, and the lead detective/protagonist works damn hard not to express any kind of personality (his only emotions appear to be boredom and irritation).  ---  --- Also, though they try to sell this as a horror film, it isn't. This film doesn't even try to be scary. The first half is a boring, brainless detective story with robotic detectives tracking down a pretentious Buffalo Bill-esque sociopath (Dee Snider). In the second half, our psycho gets released from prison, apparently reformed, but after the townspeople try to lynch him he goes bad again and has to be put down for good. ---  --- What really makes this a waste of time is that our psycho isn't even a killer. He captures his victims and tortures them for a while. And the torture is nothing terribly gruesome, either. His idea of torture apparently doesn't go much further than sewing his victims' mouths shut and giving them unwanted piercings. Then the cops find them and haul them off to the hospital. The only victim he actually kills dies accidentally. This dung heap of a movie is just not scary, and not worth your time
I am a Seattle native who constantly finds herself living either abroad or on the 'other' coast.   ---  --- As an avid tea drinker I frequently find myself with other epicureans and always try to convince them that Market Spice tea is the greatest tea blend EVER!! ---  --- Now that I can buy Market Spice on Amazon, I can finally prove it
I love anything Barbie, anything pink, and anything that supports the Susan G Komen Foundation.  This doll is all of those wrapped up in one neat package.  I am thinking about giving them to my female relatives for Christmas
The "drummer" (more like "The Anti-Drummer") on this is Johnny Cresci.  He is maddeningly lacking in even basic garage band ability, and literally has no idea what a 6/8 blues meter is.  How he landed on the same stage with these legends may be the musical mystery of all time.  For me, Mr. "Clueless" Cresci makes it nearly impossible to enjoy the brilliant performances going on despite his anti-rhythmic upchucking.....kinda like driving an Aston Martin with a flat tire!  I have tried to get beyond Cresci's chops for over a year of listening now, and I simply can't do it.  If you're a musician, his playing will make you extremely agitated.  I'm gonna have to trade this in, and go on listening to Live Adventures like I have for the past 37 years.  This would have been much better with the drum tracks totally muted on the 6/8 numbers.   ---  --- Granted, this is an historically significant release, but I think it should have stayed in the vault, or released with Johnny Cresci having been digitally removed or replaced
The watch is actually better than it appeared from the photo.  One of the few times when I can actually state that something is an even better value than it appeared
I bought the goggles and was excited by the look. They are kind of "Riddick" like. They had disappoiinting performance when I rode my jet ski at 65 mph and they flew off my face. They did float and so I found them and tried it a second time and same thing happened. I gave them to my daughter and she will try to wear them skiing. They definately are not for extreme sports. They are also too big for casual use as sun glasses. 
This item really is great for people with arthritis or metacarpal problems.  One disadvantage: One of the sliding arms  broke when dropped.  Still, I'll order a replacement as it has really helped my hands.
I live in Argentina. I bought it and someone brought it to me from the usa. The watch doesn't work and I can't change it or sent it back to usa
I've bought all sizes, shapes and scents, and this is my hands-down favorite candle. The aroma is crisp and clean without being soapy, fragrant without being overpoweringly floral. It's just refreshing and calming, and strong enough to clear cooking smells from a kitchen. My only complaint is that it only comes in green, which doesn't match my house..
Edmund O'Brien is a CPA who decides to get away to San Francisco for a weekend to sow some wild oats (and also to get away from his secretary who's nagging him to marry her). There he's poisoned and told he has only a few days to live; he tries to find out who poisoned him and why. The trail takes him into a world of corruption and double dealing. Following this trail is a bit confusing for O'Brien and the audience. But the picture is tightly directed and well acted. A highly regarded film-noir entry, and rightly so. Worth a watch
These 'Cars' characters are all quality die-cast replicas that kids young and not so young can enjoy. The kids love playing with them and so far, our 'cast members' are still intact. --- But they do look so good you might want to put one on your desk... ---  --- The details: painless shopping and quick shipping, as usual on Amazon
Sometimes this unit works flawlessly, other times it seems to have trouble picking up the signal.  I am not sure if that is a problem with this USB device, the Polar HRM, or the way that I am holding it.  In any event, most of the time it works and the data transfers quickly. 
This is an incredibly high quality pen for the price, especially when used with the gell ink refills that are avaiable
Bumble & Bumble products are a special "me" treat for pampering. The shampoo is mild and keeps my long, permed hair in great shape
I understand that some fans would like to see more of their loved characters (this series is one of the best as far as I'm concerned), and I can understand the need in filling in a gap especually if the show hasn't been aired in a while on TV: but I cannot understand ANYONE who buys this DVD for ANY reason. ---  --- You do not need this DVD to "fill the gap in your collection." They did the same thing with Chobits in episode 7, another damn recap. There's no point in watching it. The series is great, stick to the episodes both before and after this DVD.  ---  --- Trust me, I know how tempting it is to either rent this episode, get it on NetFlix, or go out and buy it outright... but don't. You'll only be sorry. There are a myriad of reasons why the company made this DVD (posted elsewhere) but what's important is that it is a waste of time and money. ---  --- Great series (A+), This DVD = F.
I bought this about 10 months ago with an additional camera. The night vision only works on one of the cameras and the interference is horrible. It snaps and pops all night long and I have to move it all around to find "just the right spot".I actually have to sleep with earplugs in to drown out the noise. I live in a single story 2100 sq. foot house. I should have returned it right away, but I kept it because I had no other monitor at the time. Now, 10 months later, the volume control does not work anymore! I am now trying to find a new monitor. I love having the video monitor though, so I will look for a different brand
This was a critically lauded film, so when I went in, I had high expectations.  Roger Ebert himself called it a masterpiece.  I saw it, and it was certainly interesting, but I immediately forgot about it right after I left the theater.  There really isn't much depth here.  It's more reminiscent of getting a quick rush from something, then after it wears off, you don't even remember how you felt afterwards.  I remember a scene where a cow is blown up, but other than that, it's hard for me to remember anything about it.  It ultimately was very ordinary, and not a really deep film about war. 
Patronizing, dreadful, insincere, badly written book. I cut my losses after about four chapters of this fool's memoir. I don't recommend it
I have always been a prolific reader and rarely do I come across a book for which I can find no value, no redeeming qualities. But I must extend a hearty congratulations to Julia Barrett for writing the most astounding piece of horse excrement I have ever had the misfourtune to purchace. Teachiing my cat to walk repeatedly over my keyboard would produce a work of more sense. If you are like me and just have to read it - just because you're obsessed with Austen - Buy it used for 45 cents and then burn it
This is the only album I own of Joe Strummer minus The Clash. I can't say it's very good. I hate having to compare it with it with his work with The Clash but it's inevitable. His lyrics aren't as great, edgy or provocative. There isn't any fantastic music either. I am not really sure what to say since I haven't listened to the album in so long because it was so bad, I truly tried my hardest to like it. But I feel it is my duty to advise others to not make the same mistake. Believe me: I absolutely love everything about The Clash, the lyrics, Joe's voice, the music, the attitude and how cool they were, this is not Joe at his best, it's cool though cause now he's gone: go buy some Bob Marley albums instead, Joe would not have minded
Oh PLEASE - whoever has the rights to dub off the original 1972 Masterpiece Theater TV series of 'Cousin Bette' do so and make it available on DVD.   This was one of THE finest shows ever created for television.  Truly, it totally eclipses the 1998 movie version and now, 40+ years later, I fear it will soon not be physically possible to render this production to DVD.  For the sake of one of the theater (and humanity's) most glorious theatrical efforts, PLEASE make the original TV version available!  (BTW - I rate the ORIGINAL item at 5+ STARS!
The stamper broke on the very 1st ball I tried to personalize!  A little black washer fell out of mechanism, and the stamp jammed and would not stamp the golf ball
Update:  I think I've figured out why they've made the changes which take away much of the Magick that is Riverdance.  The people I work with know how crazy I am about all things Celtic.  So, bless 'em, they thought I would like Michael Flatley's latest creation, Celtic Tiger, and got me that for my holiday gift this year. ---  --- After watching that HIDEOUSLY TACKY travesty of a show, it seems like whoever is in charge of RD these days is trying to compete with Sacred meets Vegas and Vegas wins junk that Mr. Flatley has produced! ---  --- So, come on, take RD back to it's Magickal, Lovely, Sacred Roots! ---           --- What are they thinking?  Who changed the number that originally featured Davey Spillane playing the pipes?  Why on Earth would anyone want to take one of the most soul-hauntingly lovely pieces of Sacred Musick ever written amd make subtle alterations to it? ---  --- And the sound quality of the tape leaves a lot to be desired!  As always, the performers are AWESOME!  And I've gotten over the trauma of knowing that I'll never get to see Michael and Jean live!  Just kidding about the trauma part, however the RD of my dreams DEFINIETELY has those two in the lead roles! ---  --- But come on, a Lugh with black hair!  The best Lugh I've actually seen live was Patrick Roddy.  The best Brigit I've seen live is Eileen Martin.  ---  --- The last time I saw RD live was about a year ago, and this was the version that I saw and it kind of made me think that RD was trying to go Hollywood! ---  --- However, there were a few good things about the changes.  The narration about how it's all a journey from one lifetime to the next and the inclusion of the Shivna number!  It's quite good! ---  --- I wouldn't realy advise buying this tape unless you are a RD nut like I am and buy anything about RD that you can get your hands on!  
Got it for 20 bucks on cyber moday. Easy to configure and use. Nice sound quality. Only con being a loose fit around your ear and has to adjust it constantly to fit correctly
Don't buy this software even if you get it free after rebates.  It corrupts your windows registry and makes things worse for you.  You will feel your computer is far better after uninstalling this software. ---  --- Instead, just follow these steps to keep your PC fast: --- 1.  Run Disk Cleanup (provided by XP) --- 2.  Defrag your hard-disk regularly --- 3.  Clean the registry (there are lot of free software available to clean your registry).   ---  --- That's all that you need to keep your computer fit.  No need to use softwares such as Fix-I

This is an attractive 10" clock, white face, silver bezel (also available with black). The unique feature is the ability to synchronize with the atomic clock (WWWVB) in Ft. Collins, CO. Watching the hands speed around the dial as it initially sets itself is worth the price of the clock in itself. We bought one for a play room and liked it so much we bought two more. ---  --- After placing the battery, the clock begins searching for the signal. Generally it only takes a couple of minutes to sync, but it came take up to 24 hours. You need to set the time zone in which you live (Pacific, Eastern, etc). The clock automatically adjusts for DST (part of the WWWVB signal, apparently). If you live in areas of the country that don't recognize DST, there is a button on the clock to disable the DST offset. ---  --- Note that for the clock to receive the WWWVB signal, it cannot be in a shielded environment. We've had no problems in our home placing the unit in various rooms with an outside window, but I suspect it might not work in a windowless basement (in which case it functions as a regular clock). My company bought a ton of similar clocks, only to find that they cannot receive the signal in a windowless, steel building. Your mileage may vary
I bough this waterproof case for a trip to St. Thomas over Christmas. --- The photographs that we took came out perfect.  The flash diffuser worked well, by eliminating the air bubbles that normally are captured with underwater cameras.  Make sure that you set up your camera to the underwater mode so that it automaticlaly adjusts your color balance.   --- The only problem that I had was since it is so compact, I often accidently would move the switch to movie mode.  This ruined a few photographs, but also made a great movie of a sea turtle coming up for air.  --- I know that it was expensive, but much cheaper than buying a new camera or buying multiple disposable underwater cameras and having X-ray machines fog up the pictures
I would like to buy two or more shells, do you offer differents colors to choose from? wich colors are there? this is because i would like to pay only one shipping fee. Please answere ASAP
This is a good solid phone so far.  Other reviewers are correct that you should invest the time to the read the manual.  My biggest complaint that has not yet been addressed in the reviews is that the phone can only hold 30 text messages in its memory.  Despite having something like five Meg of memory on the phone and a Micro SD memory card, that's it.  The size of the text message doesn't seem to matter
The product is all smoke and mirrors.  Unless you have a clean room and are incredibly talented, you will not have lenses that are usable.  In fact, several attempts to use the product resulted in lenses that were worse
I love everything about this camera BUT....The display is very touchy. I only owned the camera for 2 months and my display broke. I had it in a case and must have bumped it just right. My display shattered. Mind you there is not a view finder so you can only guess what you are taking pictures of. This is NOT covered under your warranty. My camer has been in the repair shop for 3 weeks now and since the camera is so new there is no parts available yet. So I am sitting here with no camera, which is really bothersome since I Love taking pictures. I figured I would spend more for a nice quality camera and have no worries but who knew this would happen! So I highly recommend this camera but you MUST be VERY VERY careful with it!
Jelly Bellies are the gourmet version of the jelly bean. They are unique because of the variety of flavors and the ease with which you can recognize flavors. Even better, there are combinations of Jelly Bellies that can yield even more flavors. Jelly Bellies are small, but they are packed with a great flavor.  ---  --- Jelly Bellies are a special treat and while there are not an every day snack, I love to indulge upon occasion.  They are worth every penny each time I splurge to get them. ---  --- Enjoy!
This Product is awesome. The other review says that it's not loud which is false it is extremely loud and if installed by a Automotive Electrician or someone who has some experience in car electrics this product works beyond expectations. This is a must for any car owner
For the price this watch can't be beat.  Very thin, very light, and it gets quite a few comments.  I am anxious to see how the crystal holds up as apparently Skagen is notorious for fragile crystals.  At $75, however, I won't be that upset if it has to be replaced.  Overall an excellent buy for the price and no pulling of the arm hair
My first favorite television series was "Twelve O'Clock High" and I had at least two models of the "Memphis Belle" when I was kid, all of which simply reflects the fact that the B-17 Flying Fortress is my favorite airplane.  When I was a kid my family was driving through California and there was a B-17 parked out on somebody's front lawn on a ranch and for years I tried to figure out how to go back and see it.  A couple of decades later one of the few B-17s still flying came to the Zenith City and I finally got to go inside one (this big bombers are a lot smaller than I ever thought).  For all I know that particular B-17 ended up flying in the 1990 film "Memphis Belle."  When I had occasion to drive through the city of Memphis, of course I made a point of visiting Mud Island where the "Memphis Belle" was on display (she was moved to the Air Force Museum in Dayton, Ohio this October). ---  --- The "Memphis Belle" (Serial No. 41-24485) was one of 12,750 B-17 Flying Fortresses built by the Boeing Aircraft Company, but it was the most famous because it was the first heavy bomber to complete 25 combat missions over Hitler's Europe without losing a crew member.  The idea of 25 missions and going home was established by the bomber command as an incentive for air crews because morale was desperately low after the first three months of American combat flights over Europe during which eighty percent of the planes were shot down.  The "Belle" flew from November 7, 1942 to May 17, 1943 and its final flight is the fanciful subject of this film directed by Michael Caton-Jones ("Scandal") from the script by Monte Merrick ("Staying Together").   ---  --- That simply means that besides the fact that the "Memphis Belle" was named for a lady friend (Margaret Polk) of the pilot and that the art on the nose depicting the same (designed by the famous artist George Petty) there is nothing here that is historically accurate when it comes to that final mission, which was over Lorient, France and not Bremen, Germany (the "Belle" flew there on its 21st mission).  The names of the crew are all changed and I think the same applies to the plane's mascot, a Scotty Dog named "Stuka."  So if you want something closer to the "true" story of the pilot Robert Morgan and the "Memphis Belle" you want to check out William Wyler's 1944 documentary "The Memphis Belle: A Story of a Flying Fortress." ---  --- What you have here instead is a Hollywood movie that celebrates the men who flew these bombers in World War II by incorporating a wide variety of clichés from war movies involving airplanes.  Then there is the whole idea that Americans from all walks of life who have little in common besides a desire to get home alive band together to fight the Nazis.  So it is we have the young and recognizable faces of Matthew Modine as the business like pilot, Eric Stoltz as the poetic radio operator, Tate Donovan as the co-pilot who wants to actually do something before he goes home, D.B. Sweeney as the navigator who is convinced his number is up, Billy Zane as the bombardier who left medical school to fight, Sean Austin as the runt who is stuck in the ball turret, Reed Edward Diamond as the flight engineer, Courtney Gains and Neil Giuntoli as the bickering waist gunners, and Harry Connick as tail gunner and sometime crooner.   ---  --- Back at the base David Strathairn plays the commanding officer nervous about his boys getting back alive and John Lithgow is the public relations officer the Army has sent  to celebrate the final mission of the "Belle."  Of course, it is hard to create tension given that most viewers know the "Memphis Belle" is remembered for completing that final mission, so any tension that is created tends to be somewhat artificial although there are some nice moments during the bomb run (the film might play better if it simply inspired by the "Belle" and they changed the name of the aircraft as well) .  But even if the "Belle" survives there are other several B-17 crews on the mission who will not.  Still, the idea that doing your duty could not just be dangerous but be outright suicidal is communicated, allowing Modine's character to explain the job to his nervous crew and underscore that Americans do not believe in collateral damage.  But what will probably stand out in this film is the grim lesson that Donovan's character learns when he tries to be a hero by doing somebody else's job. 
One of his best times. All the songs on this CD are great he express his fellings very openly. With this CD people can really see who Marc Anthony really is
You couldn't have picked a better person to Test Drive this product. I have severely dried and callused heals. From the moment I put the creme on my feet, they felt smoother. The creme stays on for hours like the product says. I can't believe the difference it's made in such a short time. I'll definitely buy this product, and I'll be recommending it to my mom, whose feet are drier than mine are
I don`t like this magazine. It is so boring. The gossip is lame and dry, and it`s basically a mag for tweens to say ¨OMG, ANOTHER HD poster for my room!!¨ There`s hardly any real pages, just regular old posters. Teens, beware- you will be disappointed and totally bored. This is a magazine for girls aged 9-12. Strictly for tweens
Veronica Mars is my favorite show currently on television. Although the show has been focusing more on Veronica's romantic relationship than in the past, the mystery aspect is still front and center each episode. The writers incorporate smart dialoge and clever plot twists to create a genuinely funny and suspenseful show. The acting for the most part is top notch, and Kristen Bell, who plays Veronica, is amazing. I especially enjoyed Episode 9, Spit and Eggs, in which Veronica figures out who has raped her fried Parker and at least two other women on her campus. 
 --- These burgers are unbelievable. They are really fresh and juicy burgers with a distinctive meaty taste you will fall in love with if you love a great burger.  They are Omaha Steaks best product and the only thing I order from them. I actually love the packaging. Each burger comes individually wrapped in vacuum sealed plastic, which means I can keep them in the freezer until I am ready to eat them. Then defrost them in warm water and in 10 minutes I have fresh red meat, they have a nice peppery Angus beef smell, and they taste great. They never go to waste.  I find the meat I buy in the stores these days can't compare at all. Them smell of the meat doesn't smell fresh - more like plastic than meat. Ok, the Styrofoam cooler is a waste of packaging, and not environmentally friendly but they can be reused several times. ---  --- Amazon also has a great price on these. After a quick search around the web, this looks to be the best price
This is so much better than any potty chair, and it is never in the way! Very easy to put on and my daughter loves it! She ahs been potty trained for a year but my nephew who is just now potty training loves it also!!
You've got to be kidding me. There is no English translation, just pictures and Mandarin phrases. ---  --- How are people suppose to figure it out without a straight forward english definitions or explanation for each phrase? ---  --- They're suppose to be teaching Mandarin to an English speaker, not some boy raised by wolves who never knew any language. ---  --- This is retarded. Worst product ever. --- 
As a former KGB agent formerly stationed in former Czechoslovakia, I can't tell you how useful the Moleskine City Notebook: Prague would have been to me back when I was a junior agent just beginning my career at the former Prague bureau. ---  --- I remember one time I was supposed to tail a dissident on his way to meet his CIA contact.  I followed the guy over the Charles Bridge towards Old Town, but then lost him in a crowd near the town square.  I went back to the bureau shame-faced, but my understanding superior told me to write up a detailed report about what I saw and where.  As I sat down to write that report, I realized that without an accurate map or detailed notes, I could not reconstruct what I had witnessed, so I made something up. ---  --- I ended up making up many of my reports, mostly due to my poor organizational skills.  If I had had my maps and notes in one, compact and convenient notebook, I might have saved myself a lot of trouble.  My understanding superior became much less understanding when he found out that I was writing fiction, and soon I found myself in Noril'sk, Siberia, north of the Arctic Circle, where I have seen people's eyeballs freeze in their heads. ---  --- After the Soviet Union collapsed, I packed my things and left the KGB, but the idea of revisiting Prague has never left my thoughts.  This time, however, I plan to have my Moleskine City Notebook: Prague with me, and you can be sure whatever notes I write will have nothing to do with dissidents or defectors, and everything to do with the best restaurants, oldest architecture, and warmest hotels that Prague has to offer
This product is great for injury and leg elevation.  My grandmother had a hematoma on her leg and she said that her "legs don't fall asleep anymore and they feel so good."  My grandmother has had two strokes and this is just the relief that she needs.  My mother has fibromayalgia and I'm ordering two for her as well.  She "test-drove" them before giving a set to my grandmother and this will be a great holiday gift for her
I have a 3 and 4 year old and this device did little to deter or prevent them from raiding the fridge while their mom and I were asleep. A couple of good, hard yanks by your child and this device fails. This might me a good product for infants and toddlers, but if your child is over 2 years old, try something else like the Lock Release Fridge Latch by Safety 1st (but be aware that even though these are by far superior, you'll still have to place about 3 of these Safety 1st latches on your fridge door to keep the little ones from defeating them. That's what worked for us anyway. I'll be so glad when they grow out of this fridge fascination.
I might have enjoyed this movie more if they hadn't gutted the book, which was a pretty good read. The best character in the book, FBI Special Agent Pendergast, isn't even in the movie, and New York City police Lt. D'Agosta is just a comic caricature of the book's character. ---  --- Another criticism of the movie is that almost every scene is so dark you can hardly see anything. If the purpose was to create a moody, scary atmosphere, they went way too far. ---  --- See if you must, but don't expect too much
AWESOME music and interaction... fun storage compartment under seat and blocks that fit into the sides and play wonderful songs. Gets the kiddo very involved. Transitions well from indoor toy to riding outside
I LOVE this product.  All new mothers should include this on their registry, how we've lived without it for this long, I'll never know!  It is a wonderful safety product that has been overlooked until now
This stuff is great...and we can't find it in our grocery store in Galveston Co. Texas. Now I don't have to wait until we fly to the Northwest! Very cool
I only have the turtle and the fishing net.   --- Turtle:  The turtle was used for about 5 months while my nephew stayed with me and then was put up until my new baby would be able to use it.  I dryed out all of the bath toys and they were stored in an open air toy bin for about 6 months.  I finally felt my daughter was ready for toys in the bath and put the turtle in the water and noticed black stuff floating in the water.  There was mold/mildew growing inside of the turtle.  I tried washing it with bleach water, but more kept coming out even after repeated washings.  I finally just gave up and threw it out. I had several other squirt toys stored with the turtle and none of them had the same problem.  --- Fish net:  The paint on the fish net is peeling off after only 5 months use.  The fish themselves are fine. 
Wonderful little device.  Works very well, priced appropriately, comes with two AAA batteries. ---  --- The seller shipped this out at lightning speed.  Ordered on a Saturday night and the item arrived today (Monday). ---  --- The method to open it to insert the batteries could be made easier
It was the most popular gift on his first birthday.  He loved pushing it, sitting on it and moving the small animal figures.  Lots of different kinds of fun for him
I had an old skool ds, and it was ok. When they released the lite, I was skeptical about it. It was right after the Microsoft 360 scandal, and I was critical of new technology. I wanted to wait until it had been out a few months to pick one up, to see if it had any glitches. I'm glad I waited, because they released the coral pink one! I picked it up the first day, and it's so adorable and perfect. The ability to change the light levels is great, the old ds was hard to play outside because you couldn't really adjust the lighted screen. ---  --- It's a soft pink color, glossy, and tiny. I marveled at it's size compared to the old ds. It's super hot. The charger from the old ds DOES NOT fit into the ds lite, so if you have the old charger/old car charger it won't work. :( That's not such a big deal since it comes with a charger, but I was kinda sad that the old car charger wouldn't fit.  ---  --- The stylus is better, with a soft rubber tip instead of the hard plastic one the old ds had. The colors on it are amazing! The sound is pretty loud, I find that I don't have to have it up very much to hear it fine.  ---  --- I'm glad nintendo finally realized that not every gamer is a d00d.
I use Adobe Acrobat Professional extensively both as an attorney and as a researcher/author.  Because of the new features advertised which would enhance Acrobat storage of PowerPoint presentations, I bought it off the shelves at a local Staples office supply dealer.  I am proficient at my own installations and expected no trouble on this.  It acted like a virus.  The program did not finish installing.  Worse yet, it corrupted the underlying 7.0 installation and fixed that so the Windows Controller program could not install it. I had to hack through the registry to remove traces of it.  Finally I got to a stage where it appeared to be going through the registry process again.  Then I received the coup de grace -- a BAD SERIAL NUMBER MESSAGE.  I checked carefully and it matched the serial number exactly as on the label sent by Adobe inside its factory package.  I used MicroSoft OneNote to make a colored screen copy of this phenonema and marched the package back to Staples where they refunded my money.  It's too bad about the 20 plus billable hours as a lawyer lost to this process.  My experiences in calling Adobe in the past when I puzzled through a far lesser discourage me from wanting to talk to their technical support people (who too often know less than me given the increasingly apparent out-sourcing to people who read from a script and give us credit for knowing far less than we do).  At any rate, I am now bitter.  My 7.08 installation of Adobe worked great on my favorite computer where I had the bulk of my multimedia presentations which I hoped to reduce complete with sounds to the Adobe 8.0 format.  I suspect that wrong serial numbers were slapped on the packages.  I am deeply disappointed, even ANGRY at the inconvenience this has caused me.  I took it home and tried it on my desktop there and it also would not complete the installation and ruined my chances of a clean uninstallation of 7.0.  Deactivation of 7.0 could not take place either after installation of 8.0.  I don't know what Adobe was thinking -- or if they were thinking.  I have been a loyal customer of theirs for many years, but I'm thinking distinctly non-charitable thoughts about them this early morning.  I hope they get their act together -- soon.  They owe us all a quick fix and patch and they need DEEP REPENTANCE for the damage this did to Windows XP home installations which also appear to be corrupted in the process of installing this "upgrade" program which acts more like a computer worm or virus than a program
Very tasty coffee cake.... probably doesn't cost much more than to buy all the ingredients to make it and easier !!!  nice weekend treat!   Make sure there's lots of people around to eat it so you don't eat it all yourself!
Yes this is "worth it".  ---  --- I took my younger brother to three movies in our teens, Apocalypse Now, The Deer Hunter and Spinal Tap. Being an older sis I can forget the near death face he wore after the first two(of course he'll never forget it) but the utter outrage of his 14 year old Zeppelin playing, Doors 24/7-loving self displayed after Tap...ah that I recall ever after. (Usually to any girlfriend that comes around). He took it all to be actual documentary, no Mockumentary concept for Ken, and while I laughed myself into the aisles with jokes I still love...he was incenced. "What the hell kind of band is that?"...he was livid. Okay you had to be there but the only thing funnier than this movie is watching it with someone who is so rockraged they are arching off the walls. So seeing this  lovely "special edition" off it went this July as his present for his 42nd birthday. "Very damn funny" was my greeting. It's a terrific present with added stuff to bring a few more laughs. Admittedly nothing tops the Stonehenge dance of the dwarves..but it's just all fun. And more fun. If I could haul this in and show it as the first of the year teacher luncheon entertainment I could watch my brother's routine all over again with most of the staff i work with just living in "what is this " land...ah that would be supremely satisfying.

Given that pornography is a multi-jillion-dollar-a-year business, it's sort of surprising that it hasn't received the cinematic treatment more often, but Boogie Nights provides it with the sort of skewed, darkly comic treatment that it almost certainly deserves, and becomes a certifiable classic in the process.  Following the story of Eddie Adams, a simple-minded, almost impossibly well-endowed teenager from suburban California who achieves porn stardom as Dirk Diggler before turning 20, Boogie Nights is both a time-tested star-is-born-and-almost-blows-it-all story and a loving tribute to a time and place that will probably never be replicated and the individuals who made it what it was.   ---  --- Paul Thomas Anderson's directing is as excessive and stylish as you'd expect from a movie centered on the porno industry, with Anderson pulling out every trick in the book--long tracking shots, underwater closeups, montages, movie-within-a-movie views, and some moments that approach stream-of-consciousness (Dirk's vision of his professional name literally exploding off a neon sign being a prominent example).  Naturally, Anderson also loads the movie up with period details, right down to the Farah Fawcett poster in teenage Dirk's room, the platform shoes, and the obligatory disco sequences.  Its visual flair aside, though, Boogie Nights is also the sort of insanely quotable, watch-it-until-you've-memorized-it movie that seemed to come out in droves in the nineties (Trainspotting, Fargo, Goodfellas, Swingers, True Romance, etc. etc. etc.) but has been in disturbingly short supply this decade.  This movie simply seems to have everything you can think of going for it, especially its murderer's row of a cast--Burt Reynolds (Jack Horner), Don Cheadle (Buck Swope), John C. Reilly (Reed Rothchild), Julianne Moore (Amber Waves), William H. Macy (Little Bill), Luis Guzman (Maurice Rodriguez), Tom Jane (Todd Parker), Philip Baker Hall (Floyd Gondolli), Philip Seymour Hoffman (Scotty Jay), and Alfred Molina (Rahad Jackson) all figure prominently--and even Wahlberg (Dirk himself) and Heather Graham (Rollergirl) have roles that are perfectly suited to their relative limitations as actors.   ---  --- That said, what really gives the movie its resonance is the obvious sympathy with which it treats its characters, who are generally easy to laugh at but equally easy to like.  The main characters almost entirely have hopes, aspirations, and attachments beyond the rather closed world of their profession--Jack's desire to be a serious filmmaker; Dirk's ridiculous pseudo-Karate and Reed's equally ridiculous poetry; Buck's goal of opening his own stereo store; Amber's attempts to get back in touch with her son, which she blatantly compensates for by mothering her co-stars--helping us see them as fleshed-out characters, not just plot devices in the story.   ---  --- Since there isn't really a plot to speak of, the movie is told as a series of episodes, Goodfellas-style, with several extended pieces--the pool party at Jack's House where Eddie/Dirk gets introduced to the whole crew; the New Year's Eve party celebrating the start of the '80's; the fake drug deal gone bad at a Rahad's house--serving to turn the narrative in new directions.  This last set piece--when Dirk, Reed, and Todd head over to Rahad's house to sell him some baking soda disguised as cocaine and it quickly degenerates into a laughably misguided robbery attempt--deserves special mention, as it's easily one of the most fascinating single scenes in recent film memory.  It starts off almost surreal, with a skinny Chinese guy walking around randomly lighting firecrackers and Rahad (clad only in underwear, a bathrobe and slippers) discoursing semi-coherently as he sings along to not-so-classic 80's songs on a mixtape.  From there it just gets progressively darker and tenser, with the lighting, acting, and direction all perfectly serving to ratchet up the feeling of desperation and horror as Todd kicks his ill-conceived robbery plot into motion and things spin way out of control.  Molina's over-the-top performance, more than anything else, makes the scene, as he turns Rahad into a manic ball of drug-fuelled energy and, later, a shotgun-toting avenging angel determined to take his revenge.  I wouldn't say Molina turns in the best performance I've ever seen in a movie, but it it probably the best performance I've seen from someone who only got one scene in the whole movie. ---  --- The '80's are, of course, the hangover from the joys of the previous decade, as the emergence of video downgrades the quality of the product, cocaine suddenly becomes addictive, and Dirk starts to become too big for his britches in more ways than one.  Fittingly, as the disco era gives way to tougher times in the eighties, the movie takes a darker turn, becoming grittier, more downcast and a lot more violent, but no less compelling.  All the unbridled energy and creativity of the first half is still present, just in a decidedly less sunny form.  Even when people are getting beaten up and shot left and right, the movie's pedal-to-the-metal pacing makes it all but impossible to look away.  Well, except maybe for the notorious money shot at the end, but by then I for one didn't care. ---  ---  ---  ---  --- 
Do NOT buy this product. I donated my entire box to the local food bank. --- Cream filling has some peculiar smell such that you will not feel like eating these cookies. Seriously stay away for this produc
I really don't want to be mean, but I find this album very shallow.  Classical Indian music is a very complex, subtle and beautiful thing.  Comibining it in this way may help to get these wonderful tabla players to a wider audience, but the true energy has been tainted and lowered to make it palatable to simple-minded people who need westernized electronic and wishy-washy "world music" cliches.  I don't find this music to be uplifting or enlightening or interesting.  And this is not coming from a strict old fundamentalist of anything, I have delved deep into the avante guard, minimalism, "new music", eastern and western music theory, microtonal, etc. I would recomend jsut being a non-westernized album and getting the full benefit of tabla playing.  However if your mainstay is jungle/drum&bass, then this would be a step up for you, so go for it, it is worth the pruchase in that case
I needed something to help me maintain my short hair inbetween barber shop appointments and this is a good thing to buy. My fiancee helps me keep the maitenence between my appointments
I have had to set up a few new installs of the Vista Business on some servers and I was disappointed with the overall performance.  ---  --- My biggest gripe is when I tried to remotely log in from another PC and I sat there waiting and waiting only to discover that the Vista default setup is to ask permission to run even the most basic operations and was actually sitting there waiting for someone to click 'YES' to allow the process to run. How irritating! Kinda self defeats the idea of remotely logging in doesn't it?.  ---  --- Also if you happen to rename the administrator account the change is not registered somewhere in the Remote Connections authorization. So when I *thought* I was remotely logging in under the new admin account name Vista wouldn't let me in and it was only after searching for what seemed an eternity - some hidden place it took me 15 minutes to find, I discovered that the the new admin account name had not been authorized when I did the name change. yikes! ---  --- For those who need to run VNC Server on Vista, be aware there are issues -  installing and running that you will need to work around as well.  ---  --- It seems like Microsft drastically changed the menus, overdid the default security features, and installed a new hood ornament. Other than that I don't see what the big deal is.
First I tried these pants on in my size and I looked like Kramer in that episode where Jerry dares him to wear jeans.  It was ridiculous.  I went back  to the store and bought them a little bigger and they are the best pair of jeans I've ever owned. 
The 3-D Solar System is great.  I rated it 5 stars because I knew there was no sun, so this product was exactly what I expected.  Easy to hang up, glows well, my 6 year old son is very happy with it!  A sun would be nice, but still well worth the money
We had the Britax Roundabout for our daughters and were so very pleased with them, especially with the safety ratings.  When my older daughter was ready for a booster, the choice was easy -- BRITAX!  My daughter loves her booster.  When I first got it in the mail (we live overseas) I was initially disappointed because I thought she wouldn't like the side supports, but she loves them!  --- I would like to comment on two previous comments....boosters are not FAA approved and shouldn't be used on an airplane.  Boosters are for use with shoulder seatbelts.  Second, you do not secure a booster down because it is not a carseat.  It is used because children under 8 and 80 pounds are too small for a shoulder seatbelt.  I simply want to comment on those because Britax makes a great....and SAFE product
We have served this coffee at our Sunday morning church services for 8 years... it is wonderful to know that we are not lining the pockets of some mega corporation when we buy from Pura Vida...but helping children and families. I heard one visitor who moved out of state and had not been in services for over 3 years say, "I knew I would get a great cup of coffee this morning!" ... we love this coffee
I had a cheaper version of this product and the strap was flimsy and cut into me in certain poses not to mention that it was too short for many poses.  The hugger-mugger strap is not only long enough but thicker and smoother so it doesn't cut in to my skin and it is comfortable to grip.
This game has outstanding graphics and great 3-D gameplay, plus you can really battle it out online or in instant action. To add to the few, you can play in the Clone Wars or the Galactic Civil War, the bad thing though is that in the Clone Wars the main battles are on Naboo, to be honest the Clone Wars started on Geonosis and are in Episode II not I. I love this game because you can use guns and other awesome weapons, and you can also play as the wookies, clones, droids, rebels, and Imperials. If you are a beginner video game player or new to Star Wars when you choose "CREATE FILE" try using easy. This game follows the movies really well and you can explore Mos Eisley or maybe Naboo if you like. The more battles you win, the bonuses you get. If you read the Instruction Booklet it says if you go on a Killing Spree against the enemies you get a really cool bonus. I Highly Recommend this game to all Star Wars fans! The game will let you play the most greatest battles of all time. So, if you want a good long-lasting game try this, I really hope Star Wars fans will love the game. Multi-Player mode is great and I really enjoy playing it. This game is great and I love it. Try playing it for yourself! I am about to wrap this review up so listen, THAT THIS GAME IS GREAT FOR THE XBOX AND HAS TERRIFIC GAMEPLAY AND FEATURES THAT YOU WILL WANT TO PLAY IT ALL THE TIME EVEN THOUGH IT IS ONLINE OR SINGLE-PLAYER YOU CAN STILL HAVE FUN AND KNOW IT IS ALL OUT STAR WARS ACTION! THIS GAME IS GREAT AND I JUST LOVE PLAYING IT! I know that this is one out of two battle front games soon to be three I enjoy playing this! BUY IT....NOW! P.S. BUY EVERY THING STAR WARS
I just bought this game and tried for 3 hours to make it work on 3 different t.v. sets - NO LUCK.  I can't even give it 1 star because I don't know how fun it is (or might be).  I tried every "input" available on every t.v., I tried changing the batteries, I tried hooking it directly to the t.v. as well as thru the VCR and DVD player - nothing worked.  I guess I know why it only cost $5.99.
Not Happy at all with these slippers.  Do not buy them.  They lasted 3-4 week and then he inside was shot. 
I found these to be very dry and just taste like dates.  I like the Raw Revolution bars a lot better
Most enthusiastic cyclists and bike shop clerks I talked to dislike this product. I've used it a number of times myself and I would never use it again (especially after I discovered better products). It turns your chain and drive train into a black mess. Finish Line was better. TriFlow was recommended by a number of cyclists.
The socks are very lightweight, probably would be ok for summer use but not for work or books. They were just ok. I would not purchase agai
Tastes just like the red curries you get at a Thai Restaurant.  Add more or less depending on your spice level.  Not salty at all.  Flavor is great.  Mix with some vegetables, tofu, and coconut milk to make an amazing Thai meal at home
This is my first Bergman.  (And I did not pay $36 for it.  I bought it for 99 cents on eBay, completely new, played fine.)  I bought several Bergmans (almost all from eBay, they're very expensive otherwise)when his name kept popping up in connection with Woody Allen, a hero of mine.  I liked this movie very much, it was warm and soothing and interesting.  I was struck at first with the simplicity of the symbols and the extremely detailed direction (e.g. when the old man starts while leaving the room to move a chess piece, then changes his mind and continues on out of the room).  I have 6 of his films left to watch and I'm looking forward to them, particularly the ones with dubbed in English, which most of them are.  As for its being similar to a Woody Allen flick, all that comes to mind is "Another Woman."  But I'll hold my tongue (fingers), I have 6 more to see.  What really does come to mind, and the reason I gave this flick such a mediocre rating, is "A Christmas Carol"!  It's better than I ever thought Dickens was, but the Dickens came first.  I loved the movie until I realized that
I do not consider it hyperbole to talk about the second season of "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" as scaling operatic heights, culminating with the glorious aria of "Becoming, Part 2," which I still relentlesly tout as one of the ten best dramatic hours on television I have ever seen in my life. I have watched a lot of television and have been teaching classes about this topic for over half my life, so I believe I can make a pretty convincing case. We witnesses the potential of this series in Season 1, when creator Joss Whedon held off on the revelation that the mysterious Angel was really a vampire, who just happened to have a soul and loved the Slayer, until half way through the abbreviated first season. In Season 2, we find out just how far true love can go wrong. ---  --- Love continues to be a very painful thing for the Scooby Gang, as Cordelia ("Some Assembly Required"), Xander ("Inca Mummy Girl") and Joyce ("Ted"), find out. Then again, prospects look much better for Willow ("Phases"), although we never really do take the Cordelia-Xander romance ("Go Fish") to be anything more than a cosmic joke, which does offer up the delightfully twisted "Bewitched, Bothered, and Bewildered" as the exception that proves the rule (footnote: Buffy spends most of the episode as the Buffy rat because Sarah Michelle Gellar was hosting SNL that week). Of the off-arc stories, "Halloween" and "Ted" are clearly the best of the bunch. But when it comes to romance, Buffy and Angel are truly on the road to hell paved with the best of intentions. ---  --- It is clear in the season premier episode, "When She Was Bad," that things are different. When Buffy dances seductively with Xander, taunting him with her sexuality, the ante has been upped considerably. The pivotal point in the season comes with episode 13 (of 22), "Surprise," when Buffy unknowingly undoes Angel's curse on the night of her 17th birthday by making love to him. Why the gypsies put in the Faustian (in the Goethe sense) escape clause via the moment of true happiness and contentment is debatable, but the galvanizing effect on the show is truly impressive. When Angelus brutally slays Jenny Calendar in "Passion," leaving her body in a grotesque display for Giles to discover in his bed (while opera music soars in the background), it is the symbolic Hellmouth of the show opening up. The audience is shocked into realizing how bad things can get, only the worst is yet to come. Giles's anger buys him one shot at Angelus, but Buffy has to rescue him. They turn on each other in anger, and Buffy actually slugs him to the ground before they collapse weeping in each other's arms. Buffy tells him, "I can't do this alone," but this proves to be most ironically incorrect. ---  --- Clearly Whedon constructs each season around two half-season story arcs. The first half of Season 2 heralds the arrival of Spike and Dru, and the quick departure of "The Annoying One." Of course now we look back and are amazed at what James Marsters has done with the role of Spike, but at this point it is Juliet Landau's ditzy psychotic vampire who provides the flair of the dark side. Whedon brings the first half to a climax in "What's My Line?," the show's first two-parter, where we are introduced to Kendra the Vampire Slayer. It seems Buffy's brief moment of death at the hands of the Master in "Prophecy Girl" has some long reaching implications we only begin to appreciate at this point. But with the return of Angelus everything changes. Spike and Drusilla are trying to reassemble the Judge, a grotesque who cannot be killed "by any weapon forged." Then everybody learns the truth about not only Angel's transformation but also Jenny's betrayal. Thus begins the deadly game of cat and mouse between Angel and his former allies, which culminates in the two parts of "Becoming."  ---  --- Both parts of "Becoming" are written and directed by Whedon, and represent the apex of his work on the series. When Angeleus opens the portal to Hell, only his blood can close it, but things are not going to be that easy for Buffy. The dramatic culmination contains the best fight sequence (with swords) in a show that prides itself on innovative staging of its fights, and is an ultimately emotionally shattering experience captured beautifully by Sarah Michelle Gellar's slow dissolve into tears while the haunting Sarah McLachlan song "Full of Grace" is played. Joss Whedon had set this moment up from the first episode of the series. It is a payoff usually reserved for the final episode of a series and not simply the end of the second season. "Becoming" is truly an astounding accomplishment in the history of dramatic television and when you watch the entire second season again you can appreciate how brilliantly this shattering conclusion is set up.  ---  --- The original theatrical film was a teaser, the first season on television was an appetizer, but the second season of "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" was epic and once you see this, whether again or for the first time, you are not going to want to stop here. It was also nice to see that the extras went up a couple of notches for the Season 2 DVD collection, especially since we expect more goodies from Whedon and crew, especially given the high quality of "The Watchers Guide," the show's official companion volumes.  There was a lot of thought put into this show, which means any and all insights and looks behind the curtain are greatly appreciated
I love this pasta!  It only takes three minutes to cook and has a great flavor.  I would prefer a 100% whole wheat pasta, but this tastes so good I will continue to purchase this
Even swimming for two hours in the pool, I still have mascara when I emerge from the water.  Would not be without this!
Whether everything's on the level here or not I have no idea but in the neverland of Hollywood it doesn't surprise me that an ex-Mouseketeer could be drawn into the shadowy and dangerous circle of colorful mobster Mickey Cohen. It is a vastly entertaining read, however, and would make a cool movie
I purchased the upgrade since I'd already bought both Office v.X and Virtual PC 6.1 last year.  ---  --- The biggest letdown is that Microsoft's promised support for the G5 is nearly non-existent.  I have a dual processor G5 with an ATI Radeon 9800 card (Apple), and after trying to install Virtual PC 7 three times, I cannot get a VM to work.  It did install (and work) flawlessly on my G4 Powerbook.  Googling for reviews finds it's very hit or miss, but if (when) it misses, you'll regret investing the extra $$$ in an immature product
Difficult to set up! --- Netting rips far too easily... --- Avoid this item! --- Be sure to look for something that has hassle free set up and also water resistent nylon netting thats tough
Works just as expected.  Switches quickly among two desktop machines and a laptop (all running WinXP).  Each machine takes < 1 min to recognize, same as when plugging in any new USB device.  Very durable cables.  Was concerned about using wireless keyboard/mouse, but works great with the Microsoft Wireless Desktop, including the multimedia function keys.  Version of the switch that I received is black, not white as pictured
I was looking for a cd that I could listen to all of the time.  Oh my God, I am breathless.  I was brought to tears as they sang "Mama".  My mother passed away in 2002 and I never got a chance to say thank you and this song said it all.  All of Il Divo's songs have touched me in a way that no one else could.  Thank you for touching my heart.  I really recommend that you give this cd a chance.  All of these other people on the board that gave it a low score, obviously need a hearing aid and a heart.  Blessing
THis was the first scary movie I ever saw in the cinema, and it made a strong impression on me. The bathtub scenes were so eerie that I only took showers for a few years after I saw this movie at 15 - that is how much it scared me. I have since watched it as an adult and was able to keep it in healthier perspective, although I do have to say it is pretty scary and well done. Watching it many years later, I was surprised that it lacked a lot of the 70's cheese that you see in many films from that era. The carpet and some of the clothes were funny, but it didn't detract from the film. Glad I bought it
I just received this table cover and am very pleased. This is a high quality  product: the material is heavy and lined with waterproof rubber and the construction is superior, with double sewn seams and heavy-duty hand grips. A much better product than I have seen for similar prices in local stores
This rack works so much better than trying to balance the chicken on the grill using just the can and the legs.  Now someone has to figure out how to get the chicken off the can after it is cooked.
Gerd Ludemann writes, "historical research shows with definite clarity that Jesus was not raised from the dead...we must acknowledge...a worldwide historical hoax", (190). A summary review of his treatment will be sufficient to demonstrate that his conclusion is preposterously more forceful than even his strongest individual argument can support. ---  --- Three streams of thought permeate "The Resurrection of Christ": gospel writers each reworked tradition so as to embellish, invent, or explain away; Peter and Paul experienced hallucination and "vision" experiences proceeding from self-deception; belief in the supernatural is for the ignorant and unscientific. Each of these bespeaks either erroneous assumptions, or avoidance of two hundred years of scholarly response against counter-Christian polemic.  ---  --- In his chapter "Translation and analysis of the Early Christian texts on the Resurrection", Ludemann applies a pattern of subtexts which he titles "purpose and tradition reworked" (re. Gospel writers), and "historical elements". In the former he charges the gospel writers with adding to early tradition simply to reinforce their individual apologetic, or perhaps (he intimates) to cover up some element of embarrassment. For example, Ludemann asserts that we may conclude that Joseph of Arimathea was a member of the Jewish Council (which condemned Jesus), but that Mark (earliest gospel) "likely" invented notions that the same was waiting for the kingdom of God and had become a disciple of Jesus. But Ludemann needs to discredit such notions, for all four gospel writers record Joseph as the rich council member that buried Jesus in his own tomb. Ludemann's case will be much weaker if Jesus is actually buried in a tomb that could be checked later to refute resurrection claims or appearances. Ludemann gets carried away with himself when he, in tabloid fashion, suggests that perhaps the gospel writer is trying to "disinfect a tradition...of a dishonorable burial" of Jesus. This is entirely ad hoc and enjoys absolutely no support from the texts he purports to analyze. Ludemann goes so far as to accuse Matthew, Mark and Luke of being anti-Jewish! (Refer to the ridiculous Appendix 3). ---  --- Is Christianity a "history of self deception"? Ludemann invests in the rather high-risk prospect of hallucination; for the burden is on Ludemann to successfully argue against several strains of evidence for the physical appearances of Jesus available in the New Testament. That any explanation can be posited does not equal all explanations are equally valid. Ludemann simply fails to evince that we ought to prefer hallucination as that which is best attested to by the various strata of available evidence. 1 Corinthians 15 is the New Testament text historians consistently refer to as central to the discussion of Jesus' multiple appearances. Even critical scholars date the creedal portion of the text (vs. 3-5) to the early 30's AD. The discussion advances from death to burial to resurrection, three physical events. Also, the post resurrection gospel narratives speak of Jesus eating and offering his body for examination, as well as being hugged! Ludemann though, convinced that he has dispensed with those gospel narratives after the fashion mentioned above, and prejudiced by his atheistic presuppositions, introduces hallucination. What accounts for these hallucinations? "Peter's vision is an example of unsuccessful mourning" (165). Paul's "event had a character of light and, like the vision of John, happened in the spirit, i.e., in ecstasy" (47). But Paul does not report "I was in the Spirit" as John does (see Revelation 1). John is deliberately conveying a non-physical experience. Paul is not. When Paul does have opportunity to convey an actual "in the spirit" experience, he does so in terms appropriate to that experience (2 Corinthians 12:2). So we have record of Paul's ability to intentionally differentiate between the physical and the purely spiritual. Ludemann employs his fanciful tendencies beyond credulity when he engages "modern depth psychology" to explain Paul's conversion from zealous persecutor of Christians to "Apostle-in-Chief of a new program of salvation" (170-171). So, we may more accurately adduce historical veracity from a study of Paul's subconscious state, than from the widely accepted facts of Jesus death, burial, empty tomb and appearances!  ---  --- Ludemann's examination of history fails for he maintains a priori rejection of the supernatural. Historians look for the best explanation of the evidence. Yet Ludemann writes, "Who decides at what point of historical study a `theological explanation' ought to begin" (201). This is rife with misunderstanding. One need only confirm that an event occurred in history, regardless of theological implications.  Also, simple and sophisticated philosophic arguments conclude that theism (thus supernaturalism) is an entirely logical proposition. Yet Ludemann quotes another author, "[the disciples] believed in phantoms; ... imagined that they were surrounded by miracles; ... took no part whatsoever in the positive science of the time." (175). This ignores the New Testament textual evidence that initially Jesus' disciples did not believe the resurrection had happened, and in other places they marveled at his many miraculous works. Even their primitive sense of science informed their lack of expectation for such a miracle!  ---  --- Ludemann is exactly right when he agrees with Paul that if there is no resurrection, we should abandon Christianity. Sadly, he reaches the wrong conclusion. Self deluded by a proliferation of "one can imagine", "seems to indicate", "likely enough", and "one thus suspects" reasoning, Ludemann boasts "accepting my perishability gives rise to a truer Easter vision". (210). May the reader decide otherwise
Let me first say that once upon a time I liked Larry The Cable Guy.  After reading this book, I now think he is one step above slime. To be fair, some jokes ARE funny and some stories ARE enjoyable and amusing. ---  --- He is anti-PC which is totally fine with me and even goes as far to pick on some appropriate targets like Rosie O'Donnell, Michael Moore, Barney Frank, Barbara Streisand, and "that fat girl from the Dixie Chicks", among others.  No problem there in my opinion. That is the entirety of the positive things I can say about the book. ---  --- The rest is just babble, often repeated over and over again, that even Larry lovers will find annoying.  A couple things that really bothered me.  The first is his constant and unrelenting picking on and making jokes at the expense of "retards" and Down's Syndrome children.  He must use the term "retard" at least fifty+ times in the book.  This is appreciably different than making a joke about, say, Michael Moore.  Moore made the decisions and taken the actions in his life to make him an apt target for jokes.  The Down's Syndrome children did not. My opinion of Larry The Cable Guy dropped to zero or below after reading his attack on "retards".  He also racially sterotypes in the book.  Many of these jokes can be funny if taken in context and at least those people can respond.  The Down's Syndrome kids can't.  Larry, I can only hope God (in whom you so mightly believe in according to your book) grants you a "retard" child to love and care for.  Then, I would like to read your next book. I suspect you would gain some sorely needed wisdom very quickly. ---  --- The second theme in the book that came through loud and clear is that Larry is a fraud in many senses.  He plays the good 'ol Bubba. He ain't too bright and he ain't ever changed since he left the farm.  His "celebrity" - his word not mine - has not gone to his head. OK, Larry. Why then the better than thou tone throughout the book - including speeches and lectures, including serious topics such as abortion?  Why do virtually every one of your stories and jokes involve putting someone else down?  Why the unrelenting references to your "celebrity"?  The terms "meet and greet" and "after-party" were used over and over and over, as an example.  Do you really think your fans have ever been to one of these events or even know what they are?  Well, you are wrong.  They are mentioned constantly to remind everyone how big of a star you have become.  That's Hollywood-speak my country, fart loving, nose picking friend. ---  --- Overall, this book is a true disappointment and Larry The Cable Guy is a true moron (see doesn't that sound better than "retard").   ---  --- My Father always taught me there are two types of dumb people.  Those who are dumb and know they are dumb.  And those who are dumb but are so dumb, they don't realize it.  The former category usually shuts up (knowing they are dumb).  The latter category normally rambles on and on like some drunk in the gutter. The first group is obviously smarter than the second. ---  --- Larry The Cable Guy falls smack dab in the last group.  The fact that he has stumbled into some sense of success is fueling his rambling and babbles in this book. Make jokes, Larry, and forget about your opinions on say abortion and the like. ---  --- Unfortunately, Larry can't see the obvious.  Like virtually every celebrity he cites and makes fun of in the book, he has become exactly one of them.  A thin layer of "Good 'Ol Boy" on top, covering a core of venom and "celebrity". He plays the role pretty good until one gets under the sheets. ---  --- My suggestion: Don't buy Larry's act and, by all means, don't buy the book.  --- 
I ordered a small, it is huge and has shoulder pads that are on my elbow
Bought this to use with my Weber Smokey Mountain.  I almost bought a Sunbeam rib rack for half the price at the local home improvement chain but it seemed a lot flimsier.  This rack is solid and built with Weber quality. ---  --- The one reason I can't give it 5 stars is because the Sunbeam rack has skewers for potatoes and I would really like to see that on this rack.   ---  --- If the ribs are too big, I just wrap them around the wrap quite easily
This is a great lens. I do not want to repeat all the good things other reviewers have written about this lens. It is not so heavy so I use tripod without using tripod collar (costs 119.99 in B & H). This is the best value I have ever got for a lens. Now I can't wait to get 17-40mm f4L too. You can get a very nice bokeh when wide open at f4 and f5.6, of course depending on the how far the background is from the subject.  --- People complain how ugly the hood looks but that is subjective. I like it because it works great and you can attach it in a reversed position on the lens so that it will fit in your camera bag. I think the fit and finish of the lens is beautiful
Purchased thinking it was gold-plated as advertised but actually is not.  Quite noisy - settled for a Monster Stereo (Male-to-Male) cable instead
This cute little watch comes with a real eye patch. My son loved it because he also wears an eye patch for his crossed eye
I used the compressor to add air to 4 tires, approx. 5-7 psi per tire and it worked fine, didn't take too long.  However, there are 2 problems with the device - 1. After adding air to 2 tires the rubber inside the nozzle was already ripping and becoming unattached so that it would get in the way when trying to connect it to the valve stem, after 4 tires it was very ripped up.  2. The compressor vibrates so much that you can't put it onthe ground while running or it falls over.  I guess that's the price you pay for the light weight of the compressor.  While the rubber seal is a concern, it's not enough for me to return the compressor because it did work.  I only hope the seal doesn't get so bad that the nozzle won't keep a good connection with the valve stem
I found this smoker to be great.  I am not a pro, so take my opinion as such.  I bought this last week and put it together in about a 1/2 hour.  The only problem I had was that a flimsy weld on the control panel broke, which meant it did not hook onto the bottom of the smoker neatly.  It was nothing a little electrical tape could not fix, and was probably my fault for forcing it.  I plan on fixing it with a bolt and nut later this week.  The rest of the unit looks well built. ---  --- As far as smoking, it did great.  I put some garlic and water in the water pan, a mix of apple and mesquite in the wood chip bin, and put the smoker on low.  As long as I had the vent wide open it stayed at 175 F.  If I closed the vent the temp got up to 200 F. ---  --- The whole chicken I cooked was great.  After four hours of smoking on my back patio, the chicken was moist and had a delicious hint of BBQ.  It was smoking pretty good for a couple of hours.  My wife had doubts about me buying a smoker.  Now she has a BBQ menu planned for next week. ---  --- All in all I would recommend this to a friend.  It is easy to use and keeping the heat consistent throughout the smoking is very easy with the propane controls and the vent
I am using this as a spare, so haven't actually put it in the phone yet. --- I will definately take it on vacation with me.
I recieved it promptly, but it didn't work. I took it to Walmart to get a battery and they recommended going to a jeweler. I did that, buying a battery for twenty dollars and still cannot get the time to set right. I've read the manual over and over. My sons did the same. It looks nice but doesn't work and its been very aggravating. I wouldn't recommend it
This item is an all around piece of garbage. After about 3 months of light use, it is stuck in 45 rpm mode. I sometimes use my thumb to slow down the player to 33 rpm mode. Don't buy this piece of garbage, unless you like owning garbage, in which case this is right your alley, the Garbage Alley. I wouldn't even give this to a bum, because I would feel bad about it.
This was perhaps the best of Johannes Steinhoff's books, since it does not  deal with his own stellar yet tragic WW II and post war career. The  insights of the average person living in Germany are of great importance to  both social and military historians alike. Steinhoff offered this  collective testament as a warning to all of us regarding war and the rise  of a dictator. As Johannes said in an interview, "It is always the  civilians who suffer the most, yet are remembered the least.&quot
I have straight hair, and this products makes my hair insanely smooth and beautiful...the smell is strong, but I like it, though everyone won't.  Use very little of the restorative treatment, or your hair will be very oily
I must agree with my 1 star friend. This book doesn't deliver. It spends all this time talking about things that we could grasp just by looking in the help section of the program. It goes over basic things several times and makes it sound very complicated when it is totally simple. This book is good for people who have alot of time to waste and money
I'm a wristwatch fan, and I have a modest collection of nice luxury watches, and I was looking for something inexpensive that I could use for "rough" activities where I don't want to damage my nicer Omega or Rolex watches. I wanted something with sport functions and alarm. ---  --- Most sports watches with digital displays (e.g. Casio or even other Timex Ironmans) are pretty ugly, they look out of place wearing anything but sweats and sneakers. But I was pleasantly surprised by this Timex model. You can turn off the digital display and it looks like a reasonable handsome analog watch, but one press and the display functions appear again. However, there are some drawbacks: --- - the digits can be hidden by the thick hands of the analog display. --- - The white on black digital display isn't very clear except in good light. You'll be using the Indiglo backlight often. ---  --- The rest of the watch is pretty nice overall. The casing is heavy, and thick but thanks to the comfortable rubber band, I don't find the watch annoying on my small wrist. The loop on the band to hold the end of the band secure stays put pretty well. The overall weight is hefty but not as overbearing as some other watches with metal straps. The finish isn't exactly Rolex quality, it looks like what you expect a $50 watch, the brushing is a bit uneven. The design is modern and smooth, and the watch looks a bit more expensive than it is. ---  --- The functions of the watch are pretty typical of any digital watch. There isn't anything about the watch I find confusing. As long as you walk through the functions once in the manual, you shouldn't have problems doing it again later without the manual. Usually you have to hold the top left button to go into set modes, and the other buttons go up/down or advance the setting mode. I could completely figure out the watch without the manual.  ---  --- As for the sport functions, the three loop countdown timers allow you to set up intervals. For example, you can one loop to time running interval, and then a second loop for the walk break. The chrono function keeps track of 42 laps, and you can see each lap time in the recall mode. However, because the hands can easily cover the digits, I wouldn't suggest this watch if you really need to be able to read the digits at all times, stick with a digital only Ironman model ---  --- The Indiglo backlight just adds enough light to the digits to allow you to see the light in any lighting condition, but as I said, you'll more likely to use it in this watch because of the low contrast of the digits. The Alarm is average for a digital watch, it is good enough to wake most people when placed on the bedside (it isn't very loud worn on the wirst) ---  --- 
Very awesome program for adults and chidren,lots of information on the kids encarta.My son is in first grade and he needed to find some information on money from around the world he did it all himself
The battery life on this unit is great. I can use it daily for an hour or so every day, on a single AAA for at least two weeks. (It appears from other reviews that this can vary a lot.) ---  --- I use this headset with both a Treo 650 phone, and a Apple PowerBook G4. On the Apple, I can use it as a generic output device. (I'm sure the same goes for other headsets.) The signal is strong enough on the Apple to use it from about 30 feet away; on the Treo 650, the signal is not nearly as good. ---  --- The sound is OK. It's not the best. If it's noisy -- e.g., like driving, or in a hotel room with the air conditioner fan blowing full-blast  -- OR if the person on the other end is not talking very loudly, then it's sometimes hard to hear. ---  --- It'll drop audio -- i.e., the call goes back to my cell phone -- when the battery is getting low. You can milk it a while longer, but that's really your first clue about the battery. ---  --- The earpiece is OK; it's not as secure as I'd hope. If you're outside in a gust, you may want to hang on to it. ---  --- Also, people on the other end sometimes can tell I'm on a headset with this one -- they mention that I sound a little staticky. ---  --- This is my first bluetooth headset, so perhaps my rating is higher just because it's a nifty gadget. But the battery life on this is really the winner -- my work-mates have rechargeable headsets, and it seems like they're always having to charge them. I use rechargeable NiMH AAA's, and they just last a really long time with this unit
Ever wished you could rub your eyes while you're wearing your make up?  Now you can.  You can't be rubbing at your eyes too much or it will start to flake off, but this mascara takes quite a beating before it will budge and will never, ever smudge.  One might be led to believe this means it is difficult to remove at night, but all you need to remove it is water.  This stuff is practically worth getting just to ponder the chemistry involved
Purchased these diapers(6/pack) and was blown awary at the cost. Took the advice of other reviews and purchased "premee" diapers.  Try to cut the cost and maybe other Moms and Grandmas will purchase your product
it makes cotton candy in 30 minutes because  it has to warm for 10 minutes then it have to put put the suger in the middle then wait til becomes webby then wait agian to turn it off. ---  --- PARENTS THIS MACHINE DOSEN'T WORK ONLY MADE WITH SUGER THATS ALL IT IS AND ALSO IT TAKES FOREVER ? THINK BEFORE YOu BUY  YOUR CHILDREN WILL GET CAVITIES YOU WILL ALSO SPEND YOUR MONEY ON THIS INSTEAD OF FOOD OR OTHER NEED ---   ---  --- 
This thing comes with lots of attachments, of which I regularly used only 2. The vibrating cuticle pusher is silly. As far as all those round discs, it's hard to explain the physics of this, but suffice it to say that since it's a rotating circle, you can only use half of it at a time or you'll experience a bump-bump-bump. The thing rotates at such a speed (even the lowest of the two speeds) that even leaving on your toe or finger for a moment or two can create a burning sensation.  ---  --- What I did use was the smallest pointed attachment, which I used to lightly go around my nail close to the cuticle. This was good for when you're wearing clear nail polish and your nails are starting to grow out. You can lightly buff down that ridge of polish. Same goes for the edge where acrylic meets the natural nail.  ---  --- The other attachment I used, though less frequently, is the bigger cone-shaped one (kind of looks like the shape of a foam ear plug). That I used to lightly go over my largest toenails to thin them down since I have trouble with ingrown toenails. Again, it's a challenge not to create burn when doing so.  ---  --- The nail dryer thing is silly and useless. If you manage to cram your hand into that little scoop without smudging the polish, it doesn't do much anyway to dry your nails any faster than just letting them set. Buy a little fan like they use in the shops if you want faster drying time. This thing isn't gonna do it.  ---  --- Other folks mentioned this thing ruined their nails. It's likely because they tried to use all of the attachments (which you'd think you should be able to do, right?). Much regular buffing on your nail thins it down and weakens it too much. The bump-bump-bump of the round attachments likely doesn't help, either.  ---  --- A couple times I used this for acrylic nails. I have a tendency to wear acrylic nails a few weeks and then hate them and want them removed---and I'm no longer willing to subject myself to the soak-and-pry method done in the nail salons. So the alternative was soak at home, or just trim down myself and then thin them to a more natural curved shape until the rest of the acrylic grew out. However, I mention I did this only a couple times. That's because apparently acrylics are a bit too much of a challenge for this little "Deluxe Manicure System." After sounding like it was ailing while it filed down the length of 2 acrylic nails, it gave a little bzz and then died. I waited a while to see if maybe it overheated. I tried other outlets. Nope, dead.  ---  --- So I'd pronounce this unfit for natural or acrylic nails. If you want something of quality for acrylic nails, invest in the Dremel tools that the salons use (just be sure to get one with a low RPM or foot pedal attachment). If you want something of quality for natural nails, go to the drug store and get some sandpaper nail files, a rectangular buffer, and a cuticle pusher. Sometimes the best solution is the simplest.
This is a surprisingly good radio at this price. It is small, compact and yet very robust and quite heavy. It is nothing like the cheapie plastic radios one sees in the drug store. Here are three things I really liked about this product: 1) The AM/FM reception is outstanding. I am in a bad area with few stations and this model gets them in clean and clear. Listening to FM on my stereo headphones was a real pleasure. 2) The buttons and controls are easy to use and sensible in function. This is something Sangean seems to get very well. 3) The multi-level display lighting can be turned OFF, or up in 3 steps from dull to very bright.  ---  --- A few things I didn't like. The pilot light for "ON" is a like an intense blue laser and lights up the entire room at night. I had to put black electrical tape over it. The AUX input is a mini-jack instead of RCA connector. Minor inconvenience here. And finally, the cabinet is nice wood, but the finish is not as good as I think it could be.  ---  --- This radio is a pleasure to use and it sounds better than I expected for this price. It's a keeper
I love the color and the flexibility of the material. It doesn't slip out of your hand and the cover gives full protection
Years after its release I find myself writting what I consider a completely biast review for this film (being somewhat of a Star Wars fan had made it difficult to look at it with any negative light before). Let me first start by saying that my two daughters love the film. For me, I grew up watching the original Star Wars (now titled Episode IV, A New Hope). When the original Star Wars came out, it changed the way people looked at Sci-Fi. I saw it several times just to be able to focus on the different aspects of the sets, props, costumes, etc. It was the best eye-candy of its time by far. Substance became less of an important factor and if the movie had a couple of "holes" in the story we forgave it and watched-on mesmerized by its visual splendor and the likability of its characters. Almost thirty years later the panorama is completely different. Star Wars movies still hold the bar for special effects but in a computer-generated world, amazing visuals ocurr within any television comercial, even the lowest budget Sci-Fi television show has special effects that are somewhat convincing or at least cool to look at. Effects do not make a movie and "Attack of the Clones" is more about effects than story or even acting for that matter. Awfully silly dialogue doesn't help it neither. In retrospect, I wish that George Lucas would have come up with two completely different droids than C3PO and R2D2 (the latter even flies! Imagine that, more capabilities than in the future). This premise is even absurd for the world of Star Wars. According to the story, Luke Skywalker and his uncle Owen in episode four bought two droids that are about thirty to forty years old. As I'm typing this review I can imagine myself typing it with a Royal ribbon typewriter, that just wouldn't happen. It is scary to find things that are even too far-fetched for the world that Lucas created but the movie is full of them. He doesn't really give any explanation in the whole trilogy (I,II,III) as to why in the future the ships are not as cool or look and act clunkier, or why everything looks dated thirty years from now. In his world technology goes backwards and not the other way around. I, however have a solution for all these. George Lucas should keep meddling with the original trilogy until all that is left from the original films is the faces of the protagonists. Everything else should be computer re-generated in order to keep pace with a future more in sync with its past. Then, you could buy all versions of the original trilogy (IV,V,VI). As originally shot, the revised version that we all saw in re-release on the theaters, and the "Ultimate Enhanced Version" to better match the second trilogy (I,II,III). Maybe he could even re-edited where the actors look as if they had no personalities and change the dialog to sound more confusing. Then, you would have a whole set of six films that look fantastic but lack in every other aspect of story telling (ie., compelling characters, continuity, interesting plotlines, etc). The only reason I give the movie two stars is because the wonderful effects created by ILM still makes the film worth watching at least once. Otherwise, I rather watch "Serenity" which has a more Star Wars feel to it than this Star Wars film. The nickname of "Mannequin" to "Annakin" is well-deserved as it is any negatives regarding the characters of this poorly told story
Don't waste your time and money!! EXTREMELY poor product support! 60 day return policy which they exploit by trying to solve your problems and delaying past the 60 day limit, then you're stuck with worthless software. --- I installed it on my computer making a complete backup of it. Then my computer crashed and I lost everything. I thought I was covered since I just made a full backup on an external hard disk but when I tried to do a restore Norton Ghost wouldn't recognize my external hard disk. --- I spent a full day with their support people and he finally gave up telling me he had to send the problem to the next level of support and that they would call me within 48 hours. Nobody called! --- I bought their Extended Download service and tried to download the product again. It didn't work and after spending 8 hours online and on the phone I still haven't got a working copy. The product key they said I needed and I tried to use also doesn't work. I'm writing my credit card company next to try and get a credit but I expect the same result - NO credit back and software that doesn't do what Norton said it would do
This is the one I buy for friends and the one they use at my pediatricians office. It is like the one I bought 5 years ago with my first baby, the one that is still humming along. ---  --- I have been really happy with our thermometer with the exception that it was-and-is still too big to use with my second child, a boy who persists in having 'tiny' ear canals even though he is three now. It has worked well for every other kid I know though. ---  --- About the variation in temperature taking. My advice is to practice taking your and your children's temperature while you and they are healthy. For one thing, not everyone has the `standard' 98.6 degree normal temperature; and for another thing it isn't always easy to get the tip pointed in the right direction once it is in the ear canal. It takes practice. ---  --- A good home purchase. (For really little babies we used a pacifier thermometer with great success.
The Drishti Yoga Strap is just great!  I've tried a lot of straps in my time practicing yoga.  (Several different studios, borrowed friends', etc.)  This one is excellent.  It's 2 feet longer than standards straps, but it's offered at the same price as standard straps - what a deal!  It's also thick and sturdy.  I would certainly recommend this product
I have used the camera for three months, and absolutely love it! The pictures are crisp (even very close-ups), and the video feature is right up there. Sound pick-up is excellent. I have created two DVD's combining videos and still pictures. Folks have thought the quality was very good. ---  --- The battery life was rated very good, and I have found this to be true. I carry the camera with me nearly everywhere I go. People are impressed with the size. ---  --- Drawbacks? Because of its size, there are no connections from the camera to a computer, TV or battery charger. The docking station is small and lightweight. Because of the battery life, I have never been away from home long enough to need recharging. ---  --- I recommend the camera without reservations, and will look first to Casio in the future
THIS IS NOT A CHEAPO CHINESE PRODUCT. MADE VERY WELL. WORKS GREAT. VERY VERY GOOD PRICE
So many children and even adults bounce on my ball whenever they come over and happen to see it!  That's not what it's supposed to be used for but it just shows how sturdy it is.  My friend who is probably about 250 lbs didn't even pop it
This is really a great product. I ordered it for my 6 month old who has only been sitting up a few weeks. It took me a couple of minutes to get it attached to the shopping cart the first time, but once I got the hang of it it's very easy to use. It comes in two pieces; one to use a seat with the harness and a second to secure over the shopping cart handle. I haven't used the handle portion yet as my baby is so interested in looking around she hasn't tried to mouth the handle. She is quite squirmy so the harness keeps her safe and she doesn't mind it a bit. She is very comfortable and can look around and I'm not as concerned about her squirming or climbing out of the cart. I'm very happy with this product and highly recommend it. 
I really look forward to receiving this every month.  I am blown away by all their crafty ideas for art projects, organization, and meals.  Really fun
That's exactly where my CD went. In the garbage. That's where all the other Roxio software I've ever owned has ended up. At least I never had to spend extra for their junk. ---  --- It's always came as  part of a peripheral or PC software package.  ---  --- No printed manuals are ever provided and it's always an issue trying to download one from the Roxio website...which I would then have to print at my expense. ---  --- I could live with the on-screen manual if the software wasn't buggy and they provided some sort of customer support.  ---  --- I can't believe that this company is still in business. I guess that they survive by making deals with peripheral and PC manufacturers to stick their customers with inferior software. ---  --- Be advised......don't be fooled by their slick packaging and website.

you can tell that the quality is not as good as the one you would get in a retail store.  but it does the job well and i have never had a problem with it
I can't even begin to explain how much I love this product.   Although teen age acne is long gone for me, like most women at that certain time of the month, I get a little flair up here and there.   This product is great.   Totally takes the red out and I say speeds the healing process as well.  I found it it made them disappear over night if I dabbed it on there a few times a day and esp when I saw the begingings of one.   Ones I caught early on never really turned into full blown acne.  Yes it's pricey but I think it's worth every penny.  
Never charged a thing.  I bought it to use on international travel. It stated that it could be used on 220 and it burnout out shortly after being plugged in
Is so true of this product.  I have to admit when I first saw the price tag of this product, it was half out of curiousity that I purchased.  I mean could a pair of $20 tweezers be THAT much better than the ole $1.75 or $3 pairs at home?   ---  --- Well if your asking yourself that question, YES!  These things have amazing grip and can pull the tinyiest of hairs.  Things that you would have to dig with normal tweezers until you finally rub your skin raw. ---  --- Without a doubt, you will get your moneys worth from this product as well as be amazed at their performance.  It's the type of "WOW" that makes you feel like, "How did I ever get along without these before". ---  --- Worth every penny and I'll never buy another cheap tweezer again.  These have lasted for years and still retain their fine point. 
When people talk about buddy-buddy films this one gets overlooked.This was a refreshing break from the Eastwood mold,stepping down from the Dirty Harry altar, to switch sides of the law or God(as a preacher).This has a loaded cast, Clint Eastwood, Jeff Bridges(Oscar nominee/robbed)to George Kennedy, as another evil meanie.The oddball teaming of Eastwood and Bridges seals the movie as an enjoyable romp, where cross-dressing,wearing disguises and other stuff plays second-hand to the relationship which is supposed to be mentor/rookie but becomes Laurel/Hardy too often.The story itself wanders off in various directions until it comes home with unexpected sadness, marking the arrival of the versatile Bridges.Like "Collateral," where Cruise lets Jamie Foxx run with the movie, Eastwood generously let Bridges vamp for effect. Such a free-wheelin' script has not hit the screen in a long while.
I bought this cable, but it suffered from an unacceptable amount of interference. Faint green and purple rolling bands ruined my picture. Replacing it with a shorter cable fixed the problem. ---  --- Don't buy a longer cable than you need, and consider spending a little more for a higher quality wire if you need all 50 feet
The watch I purchased was great and a lifesaver because I couldn't find it in any stores and needed it as a gift for the best man at my wedding.  It got to me quickly and was perfect. Thanks
For its time and price (at the time), a fantastic camera.  6.3 MP is more than sufficient for most amateur and semi-pro (non-studio) work, and this camera works very well with what really matters:  Canon's fantastic lenses.  Battery life on this camera is very good.  The "shutter lag" (between when you depress the button and when the camera actually takes a photo) is fairly well non-existent, and the only real lag I have is when I am shooting multiple photos in RAW format.  As most photographers know, the lens is almost more important than the body, and outside of Leica lenses, I don't think anything really competes with Canon's line.  The 18-55 lens that comes with this camera is sufficient for casual work...I used it at the beach, and on hikes with my dog, when I don't want to lug around my bigger, more expensive, higher-quality lenses.  But for $75 or so, you can have a 50mm 1.8 EOS lens, which will supplement the 18-55 nicely, particularly for night photography. ---  --- My one complaint about this camera is its ability to meter light adequately in dark settings.  When I shoot RAW this isn't such a big problem, because I can fix it in Photoshop, but most everything I shoot inside, unless I manually mess with the white balance every time, has an orange tint that is interesting for the first 200 shots, and then is annoying after.  I think the more advanced EOS models that have come out since 2004 or so fix this color problem, and also help a bit with the lag between the RAW shots...but for the money, this camera is excellent, and far, far superior to, for example, Olympus' digital exquivalent (for a similar price).  The difference, as far as I'm concerned, is in the absolute advantage Canon has in lens quality.  You can use a high-end consumer body like this one, use a professional piece of Canon glass (lens) and take excellent photos.  I wouldn't invest in a system that doesn't also boast excellent lens quality
This movie was much better than "Vanilla Sky."  "Vanilla Sky" mostly copied "Open Your Eyes" but was too obvious and less convincing.  (And Tom Cruise, though good in some roles, didn't fit this role well.)  "Open Your Eyes" takes a little longer to draw you in, but once it has you there it takes you far beyond where "Vanilla Sky" does. Also, the Jungian Dream aspect in "Vanilla Sky" is poorly done, whereas "Open Your Eyes" represents the dream experience very well.  I recommend watching both movies before you buy one.  But if you're going to buy, get "Open Your Eyes.
I wanted this workout "game" to get back into shape after having a baby. It is a great workout including cardio, combat, isolation for abs, arms or legs, and mind and body including yoga and tai chi-type exercises. I love that it tells you what day to work out (and if you don't you fail that day!) and it increases the intensity of the workouts based on your previous performance. There are several different workouts in each segment so each workout is truely unique to help prevent burnout. Your workouts are assigned a letter grade based on your performance so it motivates me to get the allusive "A", which is hard to achieve (and it should be!). I am in week 8 of the 12 week program and I can definintely feel my muscles are more toned and firm after not working out for a year. I love that Nike helped produce the game. ---  --- I recommend this game to anyone; however, I have issues with the eyetoy camera. You would think I would get how the camera works after 8 weeks but I still have problems. Sometimes it indicates that I touched something I was nowhere near, and sometimes it takes me 2 or 3 tries for it to register that I touched something. You're still getting the workout, but I'm working towards getting a good letter grade. I want credit for what I'm doing right. The combat exercises are frustrating as I have a hard time believing I'm not punching hard enough and often receive a 0 score. I've started working out at night as the sunlight from the windows makes the camera less responsive. There have been a couple of times that I've walked to the left of the screen and my body triggered the "try again" button after a cardio workout...so I had to do the 10 minute workout again as history has shown when I try to exit out of it, the game fails me for the day for quitting. ---  --- All in all I'm happy with the workouts, but just know that the camera takes some getting used to. I hope others have better luck with it than I have. My husband does the 12 week program also and he's lost 10 pounds and I've lost 9
With someone like this teaching you a failing grade is the likely outcome.  Why Dunn feels it neccessary to quote from one of Shakespeare's most ridiculus plays and behave as if he is possessed is beyond me.  It's not funny or necessary and the problem is that the book is full of it - literally. --- If you are looking to learn the solid fundementals of chemistry you should pass this one by and go with something like Wiley's, Chemistry - Concepts and Problems in which you begin learning immediately in a simple, straightforward manner. --- For anyone to suggest that a book like this should be part of any school's curriculum is just absurd
This product is fabulous for peace of mind. The kit is comprehensive enough to give security for 72 hours.  I bought some for my sisters and they love them too.  As far as 72 hour kits go, this is a lot of bang for your buck
Received the item but it didn't work, nor did it have very good instructions. E-mailed company 4 times with no response.
This book still does not address many areas I find interesting in James Brown's career but I find it a natural companion to the three other JB books in my collection: Cynthia Rose's "Living In America: The Soul Saga Of James Brown"; Geoff Brown's biography "James Brown"; and ofcourse, the Brown/Tucker "The Godfather Of Soul - James Brown". All three dig deep into this metaphysical musician's mind but this one has a stronger narrative, a bit less guarded: his late '80s fall is described in a more contrite way, for example. His scientific study of his audience is perhaps something new in his dialogue - but he broaches the subject of how music motivates women in a different way than it does men, then immediately moves on to the next thought. Even by 2005 standards his live albums contain some of the most overt sexuality, obviously directed at the female fans, ever recorded. Similarly, his admonitions to admonishes contemporary rap/hip-hop artists are eloquent but must be deemed a bit self-righteous: there is alot of "adult" content in his catalogue which can't be explained away as "art". However, fans can trace his development into more "cerebral" music, with more and more sensitive ballads and socially-conscious tunes being produced  from the late '60s on. --- I was happy to read his description of Little Richard's assistance in his early career, but a bit disheartened when he suggested that Penniman was basically a Rock and Roll raver - I find it hard to believe that this publication brought out his true feelings about his Georgia neighbor - the influence is quite obvious and not just on "Chonnie On Chon". Another depressing ommission is with Marva Whitney, his popular lead female vocalist from c.'67 to '70. A recent documentary reveals that Marva traveled To Vietnam with the star but here he simply says that he was only allowed to travel with a small part of his musical backup.   --- Despite the above concerns, with this book James Brown has shown the literary world that he is a writer. Ofcourse this was obvious to the musical world - just listen to "Don't Be A Drop Out", "I Don't Want Nobody To Give Me Nothing", "The Man In The Glass", "I'm Not Demanding", "It's Christmas Time", and "Peace In The World"
Stargate Atlantis is great. I like the idea of downloading the episodes, but put in all the seasons. Why leave out season 2?
Check 10 cases, at least 6 are broken in new box. I don't want to waist my time to check the remain 15 pieces. 
This is not a shoot-em-up Western. If that is what you are after, stop reading right here. What this is, is a real heartfelt tribute to the cowboy. The genuine article cowboy. In particular, it charts a group of cowboys through the decline of the golden age of the cowboy, near the end of the 19th Century. Almost the whole of the first half of the movie, there is no plot to speak of, just character exposition building up the picture of the life and character that these men had. Nothing is rushed, and yet it is never dull, thanks to an intelligent script. There are humorous moments and great lines, but plenty of pathos and melancholy too, as the characters all deal with the end of an era in their own ways. We see the cowboy-turned-outlaw, the cowboy-turned-storekeeper, the cowboy-turned-floor sweeper... but most of all we see the cowboy turned into legend. As the plot kicks in, there is nothing contrived about it, but it all feeds into the central idea of examining what men do when their purpose is taken away from them.  --- The movie benefits from some great performances from some classic character actors such as William Devane and Barry Corbin, as well as a brilliant star turn from Tom Selleck who has never been better. It also benefits from the stunning scenery - ironically not in Wyoming as the movie suggests, but shot in Canada. The sweeping vistas, free of any trace of civilization, set against a backdrop of the Rockies, are stunning and superbly photographed.  --- What pulls this above it's TV-movie-of-the-week origins is the sincerity poured into it by all concerned, and not least by the prolific director Simon Wincer (Lonesome Dove, Quigley Down Under... and Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles! ) and executive producer Tom Selleck. This fills the movie with those little, almost subliminal moments which make it feel real.  --- The result is no classic big screen film, but a perfectly judged and understated homage to a bygone era. It leaves us with the notion, that though the golden age is over, there will always be real cowboys. 
This was by far a great program, and never had a problem with it loading on our computer. Fast installation and very easy to work with. Plenty of available online, over the phone, or program tutorial help! Awesome program, even comes with a tshirt and 2 transfers
It makes glasses stain. --- And I return it within 1 week
I purchased the Miss Weather Dress-Up Set for my cousin's two year old daughter. At her birthday party, all the other gifts were forgotten as she sat and played with the Colorforms. The adults were waiting in line to play with them also! This set has larger pieces which are perfect for younger children. This is the perfect gift...inexpensive, fun, promotes fine motor and speech/language skills, and has educational value
I ordered this cable a few weeks ago. Although I must say that it does work fine, the cable looks cheap (in fact, it is very thin) and its length is less than 6 feet. As you may agree, length does matter so you do not want to fall short when it comes to that. So for $20 (including shipping), I think it was not exactly a good deal
I love this Laptop Tote. It's big enough & ready to take to the pool
I bought this and i have no clue how to sync to my lg cu500 and it dont tell so i wouldnt buy this usb cable, i recommend gettting the one from lg electronics, even though it is more its worth it
What I find so amusing from some of the one star reviews is the assertion that Mr. Moore used creative editing of this movie to somehow distort the facts, and therefore the entire premise and basis of this documentary is null and void.  ---  --- The man is not only making a video to entertain you (and this is wildly entertaining, in a factual and hilarious way) but it also rests in an unarguable fact, the closure of the GM plants in Flint Michigan and the devastating impact it brought with it. ---  --- Whether or not you like they style of Moore's presentation, it is witty, backed by appropriately titled music and shows the almost incomprehensible response on the part of the city of Flint at this loss of future revenue (or, more bluntly, its threatened  economic survival) and in the joining the impact that corporate America can have on the lives of its citizens and the coldly calculated, dollars and cents approach to the bottom line, Moore succeeds in showing the viewer how both work with each other, as you often cannot have one without having both.
Now I know what you're thinking, why are there two releases of "XX"?  Well after they switched from Eclipse to Universal records they re-released the album "XX" but they also re-recorded all the songs with less hard core vocals (BIG MISTAKE!)  The original album is by far much better than the Universal release in December of 2001.  If you're not sure which one to go with GO WITH THIS ONE!
The Lewis Hyman Athens doormat is a very good product.  It looks good at the door and takes care of all dirt and debris from your shoes that would otherwise be brought in the house.  It is a beautiful addition to my home
I cannot believe Radio Flyer put this bike out! Every single time my 2 year old got on this thing, it toppled over!   --- I actually called Radio Flyer, they denied ever hearing any complaints about this model (then I found out there are plenty of angry parents out there!) After some resistance, they agreed to refund me and they did. --- The back wheels are too close together, making it very easy to tip over, plus the fact that it is so lightweight makes it even more unstable.  I tried it too in the store on smooth ground, but on the sidewalk, forget it!   --- Please save yourself the trouble! --- 
This lens is great. I've been doing portraits and just random snapshots and it makes every picture beautiful! The only downside is the lack of ability to zoom. Other than that it's a great lens
I consider myself to be a fairly intelligent individual, and growing up in a family where a Saturday was spent working on the classic car in the garage, or watching football on Sunday, as a female, I know a lot of male stuff.  Even I couldn't answer hardly ANY of the "male" questions, since in this game, men answer questions about womanly stuff, and women answer questions about manly stuff.  We have played it twice now, and even though the men's team has always had 1 male more in touch with his female side than most, the women have always gotten our butts kicked.  It is so one sided it's not even funny.  Even the men were saying, it's not even fun since the game lasts basically 10 minutes.  One of the men said he even had to think twice about some of the "male" questions.  If I were anyone looking to get a good party game, I certainly wouldn't put my money out to get this again. 
I love Lemon Curd so I was quite happy to discover Philosophy's Frozen Lemon Custard Lip Shine.  The consistency is quite thick and coats the lips well.  This is by far my favorite Lip Shine scent
If you like early Priest, buy Genocide. It has both Rocka Rolla and Sad Wings of Destiny in their entirety(the only thing it does NOT have is the original album artwork). Not leaving out important tracks like The Ripper, for pete's sake!!! How could you leave out The Ripper? And what about Island of Domination? I feel sorry for anyone that bought this that is unfamiliar with Priest. They got jipped and didn't even know it. These are my favorite albums by Priest and I hate to see them butchered like this... And what about the order of the songs? Why would they mess with that too? Do youself a favor and buy either Genocide, or if you like to have the original artwork, buy Rocka Rolla and Sad wings of Destiny seperately
these are absolutely the best they get every hair easily..the points are soo sharp these are worth the money trust me id recommend to anyon
I first viewed this movie on cable, that same night, I purchased the movie from this seller.  To date, I have had no responses to email, no communication what so ever, and still have not received this tape in the mail.  Very disappointed, and not recommended to purchase from this seller
My own fault for not reading the ingredients - but the marketing info on this product is extremely misleading.  --- Basically, it's a $10 bag of blueberry candy. High Fructose Corn Syrup is the second ingredient - oil and flavoring also added. I don't have anything against candy but this stuff left my teeth tingling for hours after I ate it - I actually had to brush my teeth twice. This product should not be in the natural and organic category - don't waste your money
What is bad to say about these great grates? Uniform heat, easier cleaning than the cheaper porcelain grates, and a great replacement/upgrade for my 4 year old Weber. With these and new flavorizer bars, I plan on many more years of use for this grill. My only wish is that they were a little cheaper on Amazon--price didn't beat local prices by much and only super saver shipping made it a deal
I have just purchased this CD (the day it came out!) and from what I've heard, it is amazing, surpassing (but not replacing) Boulez's earlier recording. If you are a fan of Boulez, 20th century music, or music in general, this is a must get
My fiance (now wife) and I have been looking for a workable solution for the hair down under.  She has tried waxing - too painful - and shaving would cause a lot of bumps and irritation, even with the Shick Intutition.  Her pubic region was basically living on Neosporen, Bikini Zone, and Gold Bond (not together and not in any particular order).  We also tried scissors, but that was hard to negotiate, if you will, in the more intimate of areas.  At this point she was seriously thinking laser hair removal, but wasn't ready to pony up the $$ and commit to an irrevocable decision.  Although, based on the other posts here and accepted fashion trends, I highly doubt that an "au natural massive overgrowth" will be in style. ---  --- The trimmer is great.  Yes, Amazon should take down the photo of the storage pouch.  Yes, it won't get you totally smooth or bald.  But it is a well built TRIMMER, which is painless and easy to use.  You can adjust the length you want, and you can easily work around the more sensitive and intimate southern locations.   ---  --- Just take it easy around the labia minora and remember to use a mirror.  If you want the smooth look, use this handy device before you break out the razor and shaving cream/lotion. It makes it much easier and cuts down on irritation. ---  --- I suppose, although we have no interest in it, that you can get creative with styling your pubic hair into shapes and designs.  Hey what ever works for you and/or you an your partner
Luckily, I didn't pay a penny for the motorized SkipDr. as it was given to us as a "prize." I have the original (manual) SkipDr. which worked every time, and I always end up using it instead. It has more than paid for itself in repaired CD's--$20 for an entire kit at a wholesale club that came with spare sanding discs and the whole shebang. ---  --- The motorized version didn't come with any deep scratch sanding pads, which I need about 25% of the time for a badly scratched disc. Most of the time the automatic sensor fails to detect that a disc is even in the machine, and won't start turning, so I have to squeeze it together to make it work
My brother, the uncle of my two sons, purchased this item for Christams.  In the excitement of testing this item out they realized the battery backing was not able to be opened.  The screw casing was stripped!  No big deal, I thought, I would just call the company.  They are not willing to replace the prodect unless I pay for shipping.  They recomeded that I take it to a local store to replace knowing that it was purchased over 1000 miles away and not at a chain store!  Passing the buck.  I then asked to speak to a super visor and she repeated the same mantra, "sorry company policey."  I never go to the lengths that I am now, but I am tired of companies not performing the basic duties of customer satisfaction.  They want me to go to the post office and mail it to them at which time they will determine whose fault it is and then mail me a new one.  When I asked if there was any way around said policy the manager told me I could write a letter.  So here it is
I only gave the shoes 2 stars because they are cute.  Other than that they were quite unusable.  I usually wear a size 7 but I could not even get my foot into these shoes...and they are quite hard.  Had to get rid of them
AFI used to be a pretty good band. Then, they decided to go emo-girlie-boy. The lead singer has made adramatic change from smelly-goth-dude to perfect-manicured-emo-girl/guy. What happened to smeely-goth-dude? Some of us actually like the music, not the "emoness". Not only that, but "Miss Murder" was waaaaay overplayed, and now it is encrested into my brain. I mean, come on, it's not even that good of a song. ---  --- AFI is looking to appeal to the mainstream. There's nothing wrong with that, if you keep your old sound, which this band has failed to do. This, my friends, is AFI's worst album, if not hte worst album of 2006. ---  --- Check out the older AFI stuff. "Sing The Sorrow" is okay, but if you want truley good music, you have to go back into their ninties albums
This mat may have a design flow, or perhaps it was rolled up before paint on the cute paisley pattern dried up. Layers were stuck together and it was hard to unroll. In the process, the paisly design ripped bits of the bottom side of the mat. I suppose it's still functional, but my brand new mat looks pretty awful
This tea is awesome. I had it in a restaurant once and tore off the little label and came home trying to find it on the internet. After finding it on Amazon, I looked up all the benefits of green tea, and realized that original green tea is kind of disgusting. So I ordered the Jasmine Green Tea, and with a little sugar and lemon, I drink it every day. Excellent product. Can't live without it
this item will keep drinks cold but it is fine if you have it in the car in a cup holder for long trips but if you intend it for a child to take to school it spills all over their lunch bo
Dr. Bonners Pepperming Soap is our favorite.  Our sensitive skin does not react, it lasts a long time, and best of all, the peppermint aroma wakes up our senses in the mornings
im a western fanatic i just love the wild west. I try to get my eyes or hands on anything western, wild west tech, desperados, wild wild west, gbatu, so far this game is AWESOME i cant wait for the new western game GUN coming out in nov. one thing this game needs though is... the good the bad and the ugly theme :) --- that would make this game perfect but untill they dicide to add it im loopin the song on my cd player with the tv volume down almost all the way just enough to here what there saying
Not very familiar with Noam Chomsky's work but I have listened to many people say that he has very strong arguments. This film is proof of those arguments. Noam Chomsky has facts, refers to original sources, provides context and analysis and leaves  you feeling that you have heard a very solid and well-research argument. This film is a collection of such arguments on issues and events affecting many of us in the world. America's invasion of Iraq, the war on terror and what is behind it other than 9-11, and other topics are rich and insightful. This film provides a nice balance on Chomsky by giving us some insight into HIM which is interesting. I find him more fascinating now than I did as a skeptic who was challenged to actually read his material. This film gives those new to Noam Chomsky's books an excellent overview of the issues and events that he has written about in the last five years or so. After watching this film I went out and read 9-11 and his latest book. While good, the film gives us the same information but in a more direct and candid manner.
It is what he wanted and you provided it for him  Thanks  I made points as a good Grandmother
This is the first DVD recorder I purchased. I used the quick set up guide and I was off to the races. The quality of my recordings are crisp and clear. The nero software is user friendly and makes recording dvds easy. I'm totally satisfied with my purchase plus I'm recieving a [...]rebate to top it off
This light, refreshing fragrance is a classic, and you'll use it every day.  The simplicity of this cologne gives it a style all its own
This is the only political magazine I will read.  It is a great read if one is a conservative, but someone with liberal ideas may not care for it
HI I bought this seat thinking it would be great with the arm extension. I was so wrong! If your tub isnt made just right then it will not work and the seat itself is not secure. There are no suction cups to hold the seat in place either. I ended up breaking the arm lever off just so the seat would set level in the tub. But I have since purchased the aquababy seat ring and love it. It has the suction cups on the bottom and a release lever also toys on the front so baby can play. So if you are searching for a bath seat I dont recommend the safety 1st at all
Got it in December; CD player stopped working in April and now the radio reception is so bad I'm tossing it.  Can't provide paperwork for refund as it was a gift
I'm really picky when it comes to chocolate covered cherries - I don't care too much for the "dime store" variety - so, I wasn't sure what to expect when my mother handed me a Hershey Cherry Cordial Kiss to try.  But, from the first bite, I was hooked!  They taste exactly like the expensive brands I've come to love - and at a fraction of the price! ---  --- If you like chocolate covered cherries you just can't go wrong with this product!  These "kisses" are unbelievably good!!
I only glanced through this book, yet my first impression is that it is a hodge podge of unrelated research without any attempt to analyze or comment on the results or even the quality of the research conducted or of the tools applied. ---  --- I can, however, write about one of the editors, Mike Shaw, who made no attempt whatsoever to 'find the evidence' when assessing us as parents. ---  --- He works as a Consultant Child Psychiatrist in London, England and seems to specialise in offering his services as an 'expert witness' and trainer in the legal aspects of applying medical recommendations under the Mental Health Act.  ---  --- We had our children taken away on the grounds that they were "at risk of neglect". Mike Shaw was called in as an expert witness to interview us and make recommendations. Yet the reports that he submitted to court were unbelievably sloppy and ill researched. Under cross examination, he was vague and inarticulate and could provide no concrete evidence to support his assertions and recommendations. ---  --- Luckily for us, he was so glaringly incompetent that we were allowed to repeat the process with another expert psychiatrist. ---  --- I don't know about his co-editors, but if his work is anything to go by, the material that he collated in this book can only be equally sloppy and prejudiced. ---  --- Here are some extracts from the psychiatric report that he submitted to court.  Judge for yourself whether you can take anything this man does or says seriously. ---  --- Evidence-gathering. --- "On 9.8.02, I interviewed Mr & Mrs Orman [2 hours] --- "On 21.8.02, I met the family at Trent Park where I spoke to Mrs Orman alone [40 mins], witnessed contact [1 hour] and spoke to the children without their parents [20 mins] [and] I interviewed the foster carer [2 hours]. ---  --- Observations. --- "Mr & Mrs Orman were friendly and co-operative throughout.[...] Mr Orman showed insight [... but] wasn't concerned that his actions may have disadvantaged the children. The couple were very robust in refuting the [welfare's] account, which they claimed was full of misunderstandings and misinformation. ---  --- "Contact took place in the park[...]The parents and children seemed happy to see each other; they chatted in animated style. [...] I wasn't aware of either parent criticising the authorities in the children's presence  ---  --- "[Interviewing the children] The children seemed attentive [...] but answered "don't know", fell silent and looked at each other when I asked them questions [...] Erin related [a Simpsons episode where] Homer [...] had lumps coming out of his head because he kept his anger inside. I found myself wondering whether this was an oblique reference to concern about Mr Orman's temper but guessed that such an interpretation would be dismissed. [Note. This is submitted in court as an evidence-based legal document!] ---  --- Conclusions & Recommendations --- "[...] I observed Mrs Orman as shy and anxious while Mr Orman was very pleasant but forceful. [...] ---  --- "Mr and Mrs Orman say they have an easy affectionate bond with the children. So it is surprising that the foster carer finds the children uncomfortable with physical contact. [...] I think there is some insecurity in the children's attachment to their parents. [Note how this directly contradicts his own observations in the park.] ---  --- "Were Mr Orman to be caring for the children on his own, I would be concerned about his sensitivity to their needs. [...] Asked whether he had any regrets, Mr Orman didn't take any responsibility for the deprivation and disruption suffered by his children going into care. [...] Erin [who was 8 at the time] needs a parent who can stand up to her without losing their temper, and support and advise socially. I suspect Mr Orman would find this difficult. ---  --- "My concern about Mrs Orman managing the children on her own would be a recurrence of her illness. [...] I wonder whether Mrs Orman has the strength and patience to handle these very challenging [sic] children.  ---  --- "[...]The children seemed very happy and natural with their parents during the contact I observed [sic] and the contact records make reference to the children wanting to go home. ---  --- "[...] returning home is likely to further retard the children's social and emotional development. [...] ---  --- "These children have very little capacity to protect themselves from what is essentially emotional deprivation and possibly abuse. [...] it is most unlikely that either parent can protect the children from any harm that the other parent might cause. I also find very plausible Ms [Charlotte] Curran's suggestion (... [in] her [written] statement) that Mr Orman dominates his wife. ---  --- "The children did not express a wish to return home when they spoke to me, but it seems safest to assume they would prefer to be at home and would be alarmed if that was not possible. [..] I believe the children need a long-term placement away from home with experienced foster carers. [...] contact should be gradually reduced." ---  --- Mike Shaw's answers under cross-examination painted a dire picture of our mental competence and subsequent parenting abilities, but he was unable to point to any specific evidence that he had acquired in his 6-hour investigation. Yet he remained adamant in his conclusion that the children should be removed from the family indefinitely and contact gradually reduced until no further contact be allowed, so that the children could lead a normal and happy life. He could not comment on government statistics that show that 70% of all children placed in long-term foster care end up as delinquents. ---  --- Our children were eventually returned to us after we underwent a convoluted process to prove our competence as parents beyond a reasonable doubt; and the case was eventually closed. ---  --- So much for the scientific and critical appraisal of our family by a man who regularly provides expert legal evidence and trains psychiatrists in making competent medical recommendations that supposedly satisfy basic human rights conventions
We just got this bike for my 4 1/2 year old.  It is a very sturdy bike that is easy for him to ride.  He is 45 inches tall and has about 1.5 inches clearance over the center bar.  On the box it said this bike could be used for children much shorter, but I don't see how.  It is a little bit of a struggle for him to get on the seat but once he is on he has no problems riding it.  Overall, the bike is very nice with 2 types of braking, a back pedal and hand brake.  The styling looks very nice and it arrived with no damage.  I would have given it 5 stars but the directions for putting it together were awful.  The enclosed directions were for bikes and features that this bike did not have and I was flipping back and forth trying to find relevant directions.  Putting it together is somewhat intuitive, and I did figure it out, but better directions would have been much appreciated.  
I bought this but it's junk. My husband and I have both tried it on ourselves and can't get it to register of 95 degrees. That's not going to be very helpful trying to gauge a fever on a little one
my baby is 12 moth now and she uses the Pampers Cruisers (size 3) from 4-month-old. it is soft and my baby never have "rush" with it.  my whole family love this diapers.
it is the best product of it type on the market and i wish it were more available in stores.i don't know what you mean by give your review a titl
Just a note to those who were uncomfortable watching this film with their children; movies have ratings for a reason.  This movie is rated PG-13, which tells you up front that it has content that is considered inappropriate for children.  In this case, it is crude humor. --- What I don't understand is why they made a movie with a story line aimed at a young audience, and then inclduded content that earned it a rating that recommends that a young audience shouldn't see it
This DVD version of the movie looks great and is very enjoyable.  Hayley Mills is her usual irrepressible self, and the supporting cast is top notch. The feline actor in particular!  ;) ---  --- I don't quite understand the anger from some other reviewers about the fullscreen format.  It didn't bother me at all.  Disappointment I could understand, but this kind of vitriol?  It's still a very watchable and enjoyable film for all ages, and I found it a refreshing change from the dumbed-down "kid's" movies they tend to make these days.  Adults will enjoy the suspenseful story, retro style, and feline antics just as much as kids will.  I'd skip the remake and get the original
Alliterative Analogies, assertively  assembled, appear aplenty, appropriately, apt and artful, absorbing attention ad infinitum. This could be a fitting summary of Abish's stunningly "now" novel, written almost a quarter of a century ago with a linguistic device concocted between Kabbala and alliteration. Chapter 1 is composed with words beginning only with the letter A, Chapter 2 with A and B and so on until chapter 27, when Z first, then chapter by chapter all other letters, are progressively subtracted. In spite of a scheme tracing back to the beginning of written literature, the novel tells of deeds and characters so surprisingly contemporary, they may have been culled from today's headlines: polysexually inclined thugs hide in Africa after a crime spree, with the Author in pursuit of the woman who betrayed them. Chasing after the thugs from country to country, we are introduced to a ruler queen transvestite, war and genocide, corrupted burocrats and soldiers, rampant corruption in a landscape still in hot air, where sparsely assembled people wollow in African Indolence. All is narrated with poetic detachment, in a dimension between joke and dream that implies social, political and historical commentary with what appears linguistical accidentality: it is just that the words were limited by my artifice, reader, the Author seems to smile. No harm intended. Perhaps: the scenario may have seemed so far fetched in 1974, to have been deemed the product of unabridged fantasy. Great art, when unhindered, relates to the whole of time, in all tenses. While amusing, Abish has managed a ponderous read, which meandering on through verisimilar everyday history of attitudes and practices, inserts deep philosophical reflections as light as the puns enclosing them and extends like a prophecy to contemporary events. Attentive readers will delight in finding the one slip from the add-subtract letter scheme. And wonder: was it accidental? "In order to be perfect, all I lack is a defect" goes an ancient italian folk ironic couplet
I have not recieved the vitamins!!!!!!!!!  Lost in the mail??????   Please let me know what I can do, it has been a month
This album is waaay too deep and self-indulgent for my taste. --- Being a huge Alan Parsons Fan, it pains me to have to say this, but this was almost a total waste of vinyl, energy and money
Our family loves this game.  It brings out the creative side of people of all ages and is very fun to play.  There are 5 catigories.  Movies, weird laws, initials, word meaning, dealers choice.  Everyone takes a turn orchestrating the game while the rest of the players make up ficticious answers.   Then that same person reads everyones made up answers along with the correct answer and you have to guess which is made up and which is the correct.  We played many times over Christmas with teenagers and gramdma too!  Everyone was having such a great time we didn't want the game to be over.  Turn off the TV, make some popcorn and re-connect with your family with this fun, no pressure to win game
 The debut release entitled "Breathe" by artist called Blue Stone is one of the best New Age albums that I've heard in years! I would even go as to say that it is even better than any of Amethystiums albums. "I Am" is heavenly and "Contact" is an eerie number that is destined to be a future classic!
Make sure that your bike is compatible with this trailer.  It doesn't work with every bike, it didn't with mine.  I called Allegro Medical several times to try and return it and they gave me a hard time about it saying I cant return it unless it is defective.  So now I have a bike trailer and a bike that don't work together and I'm out $85.00.  Horrible
I had to return this phone twice to Motorola for keys that weren't working.  It was too frustrating. ---  --- Can't use the phone in my house or at work although my prior Nokia worked well.  ---  --- There are some nice things -- but these are externals and certainly not explained in the user manual. --- --customisation of the front screen is do-able. --- --there's a composer in the phone to compose your own ringtone.  No mention in the user manual.  Stumbled across it. --- --Ringtones are expensive to buy from Cingular.  First you pay for the ringtone and then you pay for the access to the internet to download it.  A double payment.  The saving grace was the ability to send the ringtones to myself by searching for methods on the internet.   --- --The volume was always frustrating.  I was unable to find a ringtone loud enough so that i could hear the phone when it's in my purse.  Volume controls are easy.  However putting the phone on vibrate was buried in the menus and not in the user manual.  Counterbalanced by the ability to put an icon on the front screen so i could easily change it to vibrate.   --- -- I especially hate how loud the phone is when you go to turn it off in a theater.  You're being responsible and the phone does that annoying Moto noise.  It's only silent when you shut it down from silent ringing.  Yet to set it on silent ringing using the side buttons, you get noisy tones as you lower the volume
A work of fiction is a great thing, but to take the life of a famous historical character and potray it as accurate is wrong.  Why not just make up a story with no historical basis
                                Walk Two Moons ---                                 Sharon Creech ---                                  Joan Gray  ---      Mrs. Cooper ---  ---   In this heart- touching, heart-warming story about Sal and her past comes together binding wonderful stories of her and her best friend, Phoebe. Her grandparents take her on a road trip. Along the way, she describes her happy, sad, and beautiful stories. Touching you heart one story at a time. ---  I loved this book. It was not only a good, but also a great book because, it teaches life lessons, and it's sad in many ways, at the same time beautiful. This book teaches you that life is there, you have time. It also teaches not to judge `a man until you've walked two moons in his moccasins'. And to not let sad things effect you, and so much more! I love this book so much. ---  If you're fifth grade or older, no matter what it will touch your heart. I would suggest it any day. It will be a page-turner from beginning to end. You'll never put it down. So pick it up and start reading it! ---        
I was able to install most of MS office but am having printer conpatability problems.   I wasn't able to install Vitural Pc properly and get error messages when i boot up.  I'm going to have to the Mac store genius bar to get the problems straightened out.  All in all I think that every thing will work OK but I'm going to have yto travel over 50 miles to get it fixed.  Maybe it's best to stick with Mac software for Macs.  I've NEVER has a problem installing them
In general I've been happy with Belkin accessories, but this cable is the pits. It lasted less than a month! I used it to connect my HD/DVR cable box to my receiver. No crimps, kinks, or undue stress on it, but within 30 days my audio went from spotty to noticeable gaps to nonexistent. ---  --- I don't like to support the Monster Cable hype, but because of their lifetime warranty I bought their cable to replace this one. So far no problems
This chair was my best buy of 06'. I've had it for a few weeks now and I must say I love this chair! It was moderately easy to put it together, it's sturdy and most of all it is COMFORTABLE! The high back is why I bought this. ---  --- I'm also kinda a big guy, 5'11/heavyset and this chair not only fully supports me but feels sturdy as well
I have used Tax Cut for several years.  Have had no complaints.  It is easy to use and is very complete.  Plan to use it again next year
A Word to the Wise about Size ---  --- If this is your first time buying Lush soap online, be forewarned. You will receive a piece that is about 1" thick and 4-5" long. In other words, you will be receiving a fairly small piece of soap. If you have a Lush store near you, I strongly recommend that you go and smell the huge chunks of soap they have on display. Once you find a scent you like, buy a ½ lb brick of it. It will cost a little over $20, but it is worth it if you find a soap you love. I also find that it is easier to experience the full scent of a soap with a bigger slice. I know that Lush stores are few and far between (the closest one to me is about 35 miles away--not that far, but too far to be convenient), but if you can grab a couple of friends and make a road trip out of it, it's an adventure! ---  --- Now, on to Rock Star. What a delightful soap. If you are a fan of the Mmmm....Melting Marshmallows bath melt, then you will also enjoy Rock Star. The scent is the same. It is also the same as Snow Fairy Shower Gel and the Creamy Candy bath melt.  I cannot quite place my finger on the scent. The main ingredient in it is Vanilla absolute, but this smells much more sweet and girly.  There is a definite floral scent lurking under the vanilla, but I am at a loss to try and describe it! It sort of smells like warm cotton candy with a hint of brown sugar. It's the closest I can come to trying to describe the scent. ---  --- The scent of Rock Star will linger on your skin for the entire day. It's absolutely wonderful. It also leaves your bathroom smelling wonderfully fresh.  Every time my husband uses the upstairs bathroom, he has to come find me and ask what smells so good in our bathroom. It is a fabulously creamy soap and it lathers quite well. If you have white tile in your bathroom, it will leave a pink lather pile on the tile, but it is easy enough to wash off.  ---  --- There are a couple of minor downsides to Rock Star. But they are minor:  ---  --- 1. It melts way too fast. I just wished it lasted a bit longer. ---  --- 2. It can leave the skin feeling a bit too squeaky clean. When I first started using Rock Star, I thought it would give me dry skin, but that hasn't been the case. It just feels a bit dry after showering.  ---  --- Despite these small issues, Rock Star is the perfect soap to make you feel a bit girly and a bit sexy, all at the same time.
The yoga studio where I take classes has a very hard floor and I have bunion problems.  This mat is the solution.  There is only one downside to this mat: standing one legged balancing sequences are alot harder with this mat.  However, since I take 3 power classes a week and 4 ballet classes a week I like the challenge.  The upside is you don't have to worry about putting a towel under your knee or anywhere because the mat is to thick.  I did place a skidless towel on it and it does move around quite a bit so I would not recommend using a towel over this mat it just won't stay in place. I will take the not so bad with the overwhelming good with this super squishy mat
I bought both the 50 Flavor Gift Box and the Bean Blast Basket for corporate Christmas gifts. The Basket was much more expensive and didn't have nearly the wow value of this 50 Flavor Gift Box. It's shaped like a Monopoly game box and has the substantial feel of a real gift. It's also reasonably priced at around $15. Of course, the jelly beans are top notch and the unique flavors speak for themselves. ---  --- This is an excellent gift item or treat for yourself
The Powershot A520 On Switch stopped working right after I started using the camera
This watch is generally a good watch, but there are some flaws in ours--not a surprise considering the price.  One, there is a white haze under the crystal when viewed in the sunlight--perhaps the result of careless manufacturing and cleaning.  Two, my son has had the band come apart twice in one month.  The later probably a design issue relative to all the spring-loaded retainers and such, and the general range of movement of the clasp
This wallet is fifty-fifty. The inside is great and holds cards as a wallet should. The outside, well... ...the UNCOVERED metal clip does not press against the leather so you need about 10 folded bills to get the right thickness to close the gap between the inside of the clip and the leather - less than 10 bills and expect the bills to separate from the wallet - in your pocket (ok) but not good in the open. Maximum number of bills - about 20 folded. Occasionally press down the metal closer to the leather as it gets farther apart as it is used. The metal clip on the outside is not good to your trousers. If the clip is facing out - before too long the trouser will have a horrible looking mark from rubbing that part of your thigh against your hand or even worse, other objects. So I started facing the clip in, resting against my thigh - not very comfortable but not too harsh to leave a mark on your thigh. But `facing in' is very awkward when seated, like driving. Definitely not designed for back pockets. Why Buy: As a second wallet (one should have at least two wallets - to separate credit cards, IDs so all is not lost if one wallet is lost/stolen. Put the small bills and one or two ONLY small limits credit cards in your back pocket wallet - pull the back pocket one out for the bandits and run away with this other wallet on you). As a gift for any guy - romantic or non-romantic
Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now is a pure example of method filmmaking. It is the true craftmanship of an essential filmmaker. The art direction, editing and sound effects are partially a small fragment which makes this film classical and memorable. What drives the integrity and semblance of the film is the storyline, acting and inner message. The inner message evidently enough is that war is hell, or in other words, hell is war. Not many directors have the ambition or the true courage to establish such a well-defined piece of art. European filmmakers wouldn't have the slightest problem of directing the film or throw in their personal feelings about the war. What is most interesting is that an American filmmaker spoke his style and the style of the film's collaborators through the continuance of the film. ---  --- The plot is fairly simple and brief, adapted by Joseph Conrad's Heart Of Darkness. Martin Sheen plays the role of Captain Willard, a war-torn character who does not see any hope in life or humanity anymore. He has a mission and it is to capture a presumed Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) who has fabricated an army of existensial soldiers on the outskirts of the Cambodian jungle. Throughout the film we encounter astonishing sequences. The most unforgettable is the dawn helicopter attacks. Robert Duvall's character Colonel Kilgore is a steady and firm example of the basic American army brain: to search and destroy and then destroy some more if it includes yourself. The children walk about the playground, oblivious to any danger. The helicopters come into view from the dawning sea; millions of sprinkle reflect from the water, we hear the helicopter's engines roar from the horizon and soon enough we are stuck in a messy attack. Throughout the sequence we hear Wagner's 'Ride Of The Valkyries'. It is method filmmaking. The starting sequence is as fascinating as the rest of the movie; a beautiful scene of palm trees blowing in the ragged wind and seconds away from being inflamed with a carpet bombing. Let's not forget the scene where the soldiers of the boat in which Sheen travels in, stop an innocent upcoming boat, suspecting them to be VietCongs and carrying artilleries. Then they spark off a heavy scene of shooting in which all of the passengers of the boat are pulverised to pieces with their crops and food savaged in the atrocity. ---  --- This film has its famous moment, some better to be kept quiet about until they come through the screen. It doesn't require any intellectual understanding, although the film is intellectually remarkable. The American soldiers in the Vietnam War jumped into the land of a fresh governmental country, aiming to protect themselves and in the end only received death and chaos for their troops and for the majority of the country they were fighting against. It was a war gone mad, like all other wars, without purpose or dignity. It was a pure act of humanity: to destroy and restore their own greedy needs. This is a film in which there is no saviour, where it is hardly possible to find hope in the gloomiest corners and where all surroundings are plagued with the infatuations of greed, anger, foolishness and egoism. As Coppola once said about the film: 'This film isn't about Vietnam. This film IS Vietnam'. He was right to the date. During the current situations of the world, where they are trying to protect their own skin, the world should try to analyse this film as much as possible and wonder about what it is trying to represent. It is a film which does not ask for applause or damnation. It asks for realism. ---  --- Enjoy
    I purchased this camera as a replacement for Canon Optura 20 which was dropped and when estimate for repair exceeded price of this camera, I decided to move on. After using DCR-HC28 for several weeks, I believe this is a very neat package. Overall, I am very satisfied with this camera. One of the first things that I noticed is that color representation in low light conditions is much more accurate than that of Canon. I grew accustomed to adjusting Optura's white balance indoor in order to get accurate color tones. Now I am finding, that automatic settings work just fine and, in fact, I didn't have a reason to play with presets as of yet. This camera is more of a "point and shoot" type than Canon. It provides you with manual controls, but they are not easily accessible. Still, I have not found a reason to mess with these. Besides, for those, who would claim that manual settings are necessary for advanced/professional type of filming, I would point to the price tag and ask where and when did they last see an advanced/professional camera for under $300?  ---     This camera is also about half the size of Canon and combined with low price and weight, produces a package that I can drag with me while going to the beach, bicycling, hiking, etc and not having to worry about ruining expensive piece of electronic gear, as was the case with my Optura which, at the time when I bought it, cost me about 2.5 times of what I paid for Sony. ---     So far, I've used this camera in about all of the lighting conditions that I would expect to ever having to consider. I have NO COMPLAINTS about its performance. Picture seems to be sharply focused and color tones are correct. Focus is fast enough to keep up with little kids or to shoot some sports/action. Sound quality of the microphone is quiet acceptable. There seems to be very little noise from drive motor and it is not picked up by the mic so it is not transferred to your recording. All of the essential controls and menus are within easy reach. ---     There are few negative points that prevent me from giving this camera 5-star rating. Lack of any kind of accessory shoe or external microphone input is a drawback. It would be nice to have these, as it would increase range of conditions under which one can use it. Still, among my friends, who actually have a camcorder, about 90% don't own an accessory light or external microphone, so if it was possible to lower camera cost by omitting these features, it is not a criminal move on part of Sony. The LCD display could have been a bit larger and it would not hurt if Sony would provide it with more freedom of motion - it only swings out to 90 degree angle and in certain situations it is a limiting factor.  ---  ---  ---  --- 
I have owned only 2 grills in my lifetime.  Both were little, cheap and unsuited to my novice grilling status.   ---  --- When I committed to buy a real barbeque grill I read scores of reviews and descriptions to find the right one.  After reading Amazon's customer reviews of the Performer (the 827020 22.5 inch Performer Charcoal Grill with Propane Gas Ingnition, purchased in Summer of 2003) I was so impressed I bought it.   ---  --- What a grill!  I don't know how Weber does it (convection, perhaps?)--even my overdone meats come out moist and flavorful.  Veggies come out great--I grilled zucchini squash last summer, and YUMM! ---  --- This grill gives me the best of both worlds: gas and charcoal.  The gas feature allows me to light up quickly, rain or shine.  The small propane tank is not the primary energy source, so seldom needs refilling. Charcoal gives foods real barbeque flavor, and my gardens love Weber's convenient one step ash disposal system. ---  --- I cannot praise this grill enough.  I only wish the newer version inspired more positive reviews, and hope friends I recommended the Performer to can still find this model
   She sings and acts like a airhead, he acts like the sams sort of idiots who fight in the Professional Wrestkers league...From the moment these two were married in 2002, the press and the talk shows were all over them like vultures flying over a carcass.   So the silly fools did this stupid reality show for MTV, destroying whatever change they might have had in a life together and filmed every aspect of their lives in front of a camera, Now today big surprise, Simpson and Lachly are getting divorsed.  The silly fools asked for it and in the end, it led to heart break
This case will protect your camera but has no place for spare battery or even a extra memory card. It only has a spring clip to fasten it to a belt or bag there is no belt loop or other handle strap. There are other cases available with better features for less money
I had this when my daughter was first born. It worked OK but she seemed pretty curled up in it. When she was about 2 months old we were out walking and one of the buckles snapped-- luckily I had my hand under the sling and she did not fall out or anything. I was able to return the product, but I bought the Snugli carrier instead-- I would not recommend this or any other sling that has plastic buckles.
Love these boxers. I stole a pair from a friend a while back and had to have a pair of my own. Love the fabric and the cut, not too long not too short, and just the right amount of butt room.
I wore these socks once to a wedding; they had a "run" in them within a couple of hours. Admittedly it was an outdoor wedding, involving a longish walk on a dirt road, but it's not as if I was crashing through the underbrush (I was wearing a nice outfit and had no desire to get messed up). Bummer the socks got ruined so fast; they were really pretty :-(
JJ, the name of the song you are looking for is "Like You Like An Arsonist" by Paris Texas
I didn't know this brand before ( I'm not particularly audiophile) but I wanted  good isolating headphones, at a good price. --- For the price ($50) the sound quality is excellent, they are small and fit in the provided pouch; a really nice touch is the small volume control embedded in the cable.  --- Sound is scomparable to Sennheiser and Bose sets costing twice or three times as much. --- The only downside is that the metal band make the headphones not very comfortable at the beginning, but you get used to it, it's not big deal. ---  --- Overall I highly recommend this, sounds excellent and matches the white iPod :-)
this unit works surprisingly well with the following caveats: --- 1. you must replace the cheap cig lighter plug with aligator style clips designed to be hooked directly to your battery.the cheap connector becomes hot to the point of melting. this is due to the high current demand placed on the battery.  --- your mechanic or local car electroncs store should be able to do this for you. also, it will take approx 5 min to inflate your tire. it is a bit slow. --- 2. you should run your car engine so the battery doesnt run down. the product has a built in fan that seems to keep the unit cooler while running. i liked it for what it is
Stick to singing in Spanish, Shak
This is a great bra for any mother that is looking for a nursing bra!  I live in the US and had a terrible time finding this bra in any store or anywhere on line.  It's a fabulous bra. It's very comfortable, washed up nicely and provides great support.  This is our second child and I wish I had these with the first
My daughter really LOVES this BUS.  Whenever it is in the room she rolls over to it and loves to sit up next to it.  She plays with the blocks and likes to discover how to hold them and also look at what is inside them.    --- The BAD thing with this is that it rolls when she is holding onto it and the little piece with the shapes flaps up.  My daughter was playing with it one day and the piece flaped up and she ended up with her arm stuck in between it and the toy and she was leaning on the flap putting pressure on it against her arm.  But since that snaps off we took it off and there has not been an issue since. 
I wish I would have read the reviews on this before I bought the pump. This is a bad breast pump. I couldn't get anything out of my breasts with this except for sore nipples. It has very poor suction, is a pain to put together, and is uncomfortable to use. [...] So don't waste your time and money buy something different. If I could have rated this a negative I would have
I've had this phone for about a week now and I'm glad I waited to post a review because my initial reaction was not very positive. Coming from owning a RAZR and many Windows-based devices, there was an initial learning curve to some of the functions. Also, I was NOT convinced that the strange keyboard would really recognize what you were attempting to type. Boy was I wrong about that one. OK, so for the review. ---  --- My motivation for purchasing was primarily to get a PHONE first, with a few bells and whistles for when I just want to play with the device. The Pearl fits that bill perfectly. Phone quality is excellent. Loading ringtones (a pain at first) proved to be relatively easy once I did a little research. Ringtones play very loud and clear. The music player is MUCH better than first impressions would lead you to believe. After a few hours of frustration, I was all ready to purchase a 3rd party app. Again, did some research, visited a few forums, and found out there is much more functionality in the included music player than you might realize. As an owner of a NANO, I was disappointed with the interface of the player. But once you go into the menu functions, you'll find much more functionality. It's not an ipod, but it works as an decent replacement. And if you're not an ipod owner, you'll likely have no complaints. Sound of tunes is quite nice when using headphones. Camera is only so-so, but I don't really care about that anyway. Must admit that I thought it would be better since it is a megapixal camera. The couple of pictures I took were dark and somewhat grainy. Part of why I dropped my rating from 5 stars. As far as email, I have a BB from work and they won't let me use a non-work issued device to access the network, so I have no opinion on email functionality. Organizer features (calendar, tasks, notes, etc) seem more than adequate. Much better than any of my old Pocket PC devices. ---  --- The only complaints I would have is that there are still 2 basic things that I haven't been able to figure out and while I'm admittingly not a techie, these should be pretty basic and intuitive. One, I would like to set one of my ringtones as the default ringer. That should be fairly simplistic but I can't figure it out. Two, I would like to change the order of the icons on some of the themes. Again, should be pretty basic, but no go. Almost forgot, can't listen to music through bluetooth. Not sure why, but this is really my only MAJOR complaint. ---  --- Only minor complaints. All in all, a pretty sweet device. And BTW, form factor and looks are simply the best out there. I came so close to purchasing the Blackjack, very happy that I went with the Pearl. ---  --- UPDATE - Figured out how to set default ringtone and move icons. Coming from a Windows mobile environment, I was expecting something along the lines of: Start-programs-etc-etc. Everyting in windows takes so many keystroks. With the Pearl, it was so easy. I was simply expecting it to be much more difficult based on my prior experience. I'm going to still keep it at 4 stars because of the lack of BT stereo. Otherwise, as close to a perfect device as I've used (and I've used quite a few)
Bought 2 of these 3 years ago on QVC for my husband and myself.  I was pregnant with my second son and going to get waxed at the nail shop, where it smelled like nail polish remover, was just too much for me at the time.  We love these shavers and they work just as well today as they did 3 years ago!  I'm not sure what the other reviewer is talking about, I get an incredibly close shave with this.  To be honest, and maybe a little too personal, I haven't waxed my upper lip since, I only use this!  There is NO stubble, NO pain and great results!  I have dark hair, and if this in anyway made me look like I shaved, I would never use it!  I am buying 2 more for back up.  I hope they never stop making these!!
This bag is so cheap looking I am embarrassed to use it.  When I saw it online it looked identical to a US Luggage bag I bought at TJ Maxx, which was stolen.  So, I was very excited to find what I thought was the same bag on Amazon to replace it.  When I got it, I was shocked at how cheap it looks.  The handles especially are plastic leather and just hideous.  The return policy through eBags is such a hassle that I am just going to keep it and use it for bringing my laptop to and from work, but I will still need to find a better travel laptop bag.  I'm very disappointed.  If you're looking for a professional looking laptop bag, this isn't it.  I should have known better for the price, but like I said, I thought it was the same as the other US Luggage bag I had, which was gorgeous and I loved it.  Oh well.
What a great pair of pajamas these are.  So soft, non-binding, roomy, and great for lounging.  I've already decided to get another pair in a different color after the holidays.  Very good quality silk, well sewn and tailored.  I'm normally an XL tall but the regular XL fit fine
After growing up in Africa, one becomes rather fond of Rooibos tea and I never thought the day would arrive when I would recommend anything but a pure Rooibos tea. Tazo has taken Rooibos tea to a new level by blending African Rooibos (red bush) with hibiscus, lemon myrtle, lemon verbena, orange peel, rosemary, and lemon balm. ---  --- Rooibos has quite a distinctive fragrance that reminds me a bit of fragrant flowers waving in a warm afternoon breeze after an African veld fire. I remember mixing in a tablespoon of condensed milk as a child. Now I mix in powdered milk and honey. Honey seems to bring out the rich flavors in this particular tea blend. For some reason, this blend is rather delicious with a toasted and buttered cinnamon/raisin bagel.  ---  --- I've recently rediscovered the health benefits of Rooibos although I can truly say I've been drinking this tea for most of my existence on this planet. Rooibos is naturally sweet, very aromatic and is high in magnesium, calcium, iron and copper. Mothers in Africa will often add an infusion of this tea to a bottle of milk for babies to cure colic. An application of cold Rooibos tea can also aid in clearing the skin or is recommended for allergies, indigestion, insomnia and nervous tension.  ---  --- This is one of the Tazo teas that should not be steeped for too long because of all the delicate flavors. If you enjoy this tea, you might also want to try Tazo Honeybush tea.  ---  --- The Tazo company really has my attention with their packaging, amusing tales of ancient Tazo wheels and they know how to blend tea to absolute perfection.  ---  --- ~TheRebeccaReview.com
I really liked this movie. I thought it was a great super hero movie that had some humor built into it. It was well told and the characters were well developed. The special effects were great too!! I am not one for comic book heros, but this one confinced me otherwise. I recommend this movie to anyone that wants to see a good over evil story that was orginally a comic book character.
The dash of my black car is anthracite gray, and it shows dust easily. The California duster is created for either exteriors or interiors of cars and is impregnated with paraffin wax. This picks up the dust and the soft fibers float over the uneven surfaces of the car interior, picking it all up in one swipe. ---  --- I keep this in the car and once a week I swipe down the interior all over to keep the car sparkling clean. It's small enough to keep handy under the seat. ---  --- This makes a really nice gift for someone to congratulate them on their new car, or for someone who likes doing their own detailing
I had the Chi Turbo (1"), but I got worried after reading some reviews about it being unreliable.  So part of the reason I wanted to buy the T3 iron was that it comes with a 4-YEAR comprehensive warranty.  The other difference is that the solid-ceramic plates are "infused" with tourmaline which I found intriguing. ---  --- 1-3/8" wide plates are the perfect width for my long-ish hair.  (I've used a 2 inch wide iron, which I found harder to maneuver.)  It heats up fast, and stays hot.  It does a great job gripping the hair without snagging.  My hair stays silky and straight all day, and does not feel damaged after a while, like it did with cheaper irons I've used in the past. ---  --- Another thing that this iron does that other irons do not do as well - it really curls.  It has heat vents along the sides of the plates that lets you curl your hair by twisting it near the root and pulling it through (different from the usual method of gripping the ends of the strands and then winding up).  It creates a springy curl better than any flat iron I've used.  (However, the heating vents make the exterior of the iron hotter to the touch.  So there is a drawback to this function.) ---  --- Overall, I enjoy using this flat iron.  Very happy with this purchase. ---  --- ETA: I've learned that HairArt will not honor the warranty unless you buy it from an authorized distributor (e.g., Sephora). So you might want to check that before you place your order
I received my Curious perfume not last christmas, but the christmas before.. and i was SO excited, i had already been through the shops at least 15 times just trying it on over and over, using every tester i could find. --- when i got it, i was just as happy and used it just *so* carefully, i wanted it to last for years.  --- i got the one that comes with the pump, the largest bottle.... anyway,  --- i now look over to my dresser and see it sitting there. YELLOW. --- my curious perfume --- WENT --- YELLOW --- and apparently mine was not the only one that went bright yellow, my brothers girlfriends is also a lovely urine coloured yellow.  --- it also grew a sticky coat of curious smelling...crud.. around the bottle and just today i went over to it, only to find it LEAKING all over my table... i squeeze the pump and it is rock hard... i look over to the nozzle and it is covered in a thick crust, the whole thing has crusted over and is leaking, i squeezed it again and  my curious perfume  splerted out.. --- it now smells off --- and doesn't really look all that fantastic as you may have guessed. --- i am DISGUSTED and so  --- so angry --- that perfume i wanted so bad and was so excited to get now sits on the table surrounded by it's own disgusting pool of crust and leaking hardened perfume (i didn't even know that was possible)  --- i am disgusted --- what a cheap nasty NASTY product. --- do NOT buy it unless you think you're going to use it within a period of 1 year. ---  --- good work! --- a product as cheap and nasty as the person endorsing it
I received this sheet and was immediately disappointed.  The quality is very cheap and it wasn't a perfect fit.  I am surprised that this is made by Graco - usually their products are good.  I would not recommend buying this. I would buy a regular crib sheet instead.
After researching several cameras in this price range, I bought the Rebel T2 last month. It has met my expectations and perhaps then some. After recently trying out a friends camera in the 150.-ish range, I partially regret spending what I did. It all comes down to what you need, want, and how many bells and whistles you like. For the money though, compared to the competitors, I still think I made a good purchase. After all, if I use it for ten years, which I most likely will, I will have surely got my moneys worth. Bottom line: no complaints with it
I am a female bowhunter who really had trouble judjing distances on green fields. This is a great product . It is easy to use and very accurate
I love this thing. I open most of my kids toys with it plus anything else in a plastic package. It is so simple so fast and just a brilliant tool to use. Forget using scissors or knives you can really get hurt. The Pyranna is safe, fast and easy. Thanks for making a great product
I wanted to use this product to tape sporting events, as part of a promotions unit I belong to. I had used Videowave 7 which was OK and produced a more than adequate product, but would on occassion crash to the extent I would have to reload the software. I thought I would give PE 3.0 ago, since Adobe products generally have a good reputation.  ---  --- Well, it goes to show that you can't just rely on reputation. The program lets me down horribly when capturing the video from the camera. THe camera records DVD video (VOB files) straight to DVD. When I capture these files into the PE program, all moving images within the video become pixelated with lost resolution to the point of being useless. I have tried various other ways of capturing but always the same result. There is nothing to be done from that point...for me this program falls on the first hurdle!! It is unbelievable to me that a professionally released image processing algorithm could corrupt video so badly, and frustrating that I actually paid money for it...a first year undergraduate could have provided a better effort.  ---  --- I have subsequently gone through the motions to produce a video, and to be honest he layout of the settings, ease of applicaiton of various functions is quite good and better than Videowave 7 IMHO. I was able to produce quite nice edited products with intro, text and audio overlays very quickly. Still this isn't much use when the video itself had already been digitally butchered. ---  --- If you are videoing things that don't move you may well like this product. If you are videoing dynamic scenes, give it a miss. Big disappointment
The product was in very good condition and it was delivered very promptly
This DVD is tough... but don't be scared. Cathe does a great job with the premixes and you can pick shorter versions of the workout. I love the music on this DVD.... It's so much fun... it makes me want to keep jumping!!! The upper body routine is about 20 minutes long. It's efficient and straight to the point. ---  --- I've never seen results as quickly before... Cathe will definitely delivery results!!!
This movie has the best opening scene ever!  It's amazing how great they made this movie considering the first one was only eh... ---  --- Highly recommended
hard to set up and use. no directions and can't find anything on the web.  Would not buy if I knew this
I'm about halfway thru this and trying to decide whether or not to sell it to a used bookstore without finishing.  I kept thinking, maybe it's me, maybe there's something wrong with my attention span that I lose interest in these stories half way thru.  They all seem too long, unfocussed. What they really feel like is novels that have been brutally hacked down to the maximum allowable length for short stories.  The quality puzzles me because I'm almost always happily surprised by the quality and variety of short sf I read in the zines.  I haven't followed this anthology over the years, but this particular edition, imho, shows bad selection and worse editing
These were ordered for my son for regular sledding and tubing activities. He thinks they are warm and comfortable - not stiff like similar snow pants from other manufacturers.  They are a great value
I have used this bench for a little over a week. For the price you can't go wrong. It is sturdy and seems to be well made. The adjustment is smooth and locks firmly in place. (Great for lying leg lifts). All and all this is a good bench, I would have given it five stars, but the description says it can be fully up right for use during military presses, this is not true, it can almost go vertical, but not completely.  Still, I think you would be happy with it, I am. 
I bought this for my husbands birthday.  He was very excited.  He had been looking at bags at a local store and hadn't found anything as nice as this, especially for the price.  Plenty of room for his laptop and pens, notebooks, extra books, etc.  Very durable, highly recommend
Anthony Hopkins is absolutely riveting as Adolf Hitler.  He captures all of Hitler's mannerisms, quirks, and facial expressions.  My only complaint is that he doesn't use a German accent.  The production is poor, and there are some flaws in the story.  For example, Albert Speer is made out to be almost a hero in the film.  It has been proven that there was actually no assassination attempt made by Speer.  The guy who plays Joseph Goebbels is horrible, one of the worst acting jobs I've seen.  But overall the acting is great, and the performance by Hopkins makes this movie worth owning
Flavor is very good.   The reason I couldn't rate it higher is that I have trouble getting it to thoroughly mix in.   
Purchased this album because of the great Album cover, was I surprised when I popped it into my CD player. I hadn't heard of Rick Braun before but  after listening to this CD, I ran out and purchased everything he has ever  recorded. Never have I heard a trumpet sound so beautiful. Share this music  with someone you love
The sound was great, but the DVD would lag every 10-15 seconds during any and all movies.  It drove me nuts. I had to return it.
Like the other reviews, I find this game a rip-off of Caesare III. (I didn't know there was a IV! Must look into that.) While the graphics are admirable, the gameplay wasn't challenging at all. It didn't take me any time at all to win, and I'm one of the worst game players ever. OTOH, it's a good afternoon waster if all you want to do is build and perfect your city in open play with no goals. Don't buy it now. Wait until it's cheap, like $9.95 or something.
I've had a Treo 650 for a long time.  I wasn't 100% sure I'd want the 680, when it was first announced, but a big nasty scratch on my 650's screen helped me decide to take the plunge.  I'm so glad I did.  The lack of a protruding antenna makes it fit in my pocket much better, the internal slot for the SIM card eliminates my worry that it might get lost, and the covered SD card slot is very welcome, because the darned thing always popped out in my 650.  The only thing lost from the 650 is the reset button.  To reset the 680, you have to take out the battery.  That's not a big deal, since even on the 650, you have to remove the battery cover to get to the reset switch.  What's better on the 650?  The main thing for me is that the cell phone's radio is slightly more sensitive and that it will take 8gb SD cards (SDHC).  I use this phone for everything, since it's also a great Palm organizer.  In addition to that, I've installed a registered version of Pocket Tunes, so it's a very good MP3 player.  It's even compatible with PlaysForSure, if you're into that.  That's why I'm so happy to see the 8gb support.  I also use the phone to play games, like Monopoly and Scrabble, when I'm waiting on line or in a boring meeting.  I have absolutely zero complaints about this phone.
I love the Bears. It's impossible for any Bears fan to not love Walter Payton. With that love I ordered this jersey and it shipped to me from FansEdge. The shipping and billing was very speedy and with little delay I had the jersey delivered to my doorstep. It went downhill from there. ---  --- As soon as I opened the package I noticed that the 'GSH' (George S. Halas) initials had been sewn over and was broken. Very disappointing. I called FansEdge and they were great on the phone and sent me another jersey. While waiting for the replacement jersey I wore the defective one. By the time the replacement jersey came the iron-on stripes on the sleeves started to peel off. I figured it was just a defective jersey and opened the replacement one. It was exactly the same way. So either FansEdge received a batch of jerseys that were of poor quality or Reebok is maximizing their profit margins and overpricing a cheaply made jersey with one of the most incredible athletes ever name on it. ---  --- After asking and waiting 2 weeks for FansEdge to check their supply of jerseys to see if they were all like this with no reply...I cancelled my order. I am still waiting for a refund. This has been over a month now. ---  --- With the poor support of FansEdge and what appears like a poorly made jersey I cannot recommend anyone getting this. If you absolutely want one I recommend buying from a brick and mortar store. ---  --- 1/
Beware of KINGSTON rebates! ---  --- Of course, I hope your experience would differ, if you were to buy Kingston product(s), but mine was terrible. ---  --- I bought a Kingston CompactFlash card that offered a $50 mail-in rebate.  I promptly (as in, the day AFTER I received the item delivery) went to photocopy my rebate certificate and UPC code and sales receipt; then sent it all on its merry way.  Yes, I was well within the rebate period, both for the purchase AND for the postmark date.  My purchase was a valid retailer (think HUGE online e-tailer). ---  --- The rebate REQUIRED sending THE ENTIRE ORIGINAL UPC label, which was like the entire outside package for my CF card, about the size of 1 ½ business cards when flattened.  No problem. ---  --- About TWO MONTHS later, I get a letter saying "your rebate request was denied because you failed to furnish the appropriate ORIGINAL UPC code as required by the rebate offer." ---  --- Well, now  WHAT?  I can't RE-SEND the original (it was already in their possession).  I called, and they insisted on repeating what the letter said.  I re-sent my PHOTOCOPIES and they said a photocopy is invalid proof of purchase. ---  --- After another 6 weeks of pursuing this, I figured this is their scam.  They simply wouldn't honor the rebate.  And without the ORIGINAL UPC in my possession, I couldn't really submit to their requirements. ---  --- If you're looking for a RAM upgrade, I'd suggest you look at a quality company like OCZ (the BEST!), or Patriot, Geil, or Corsair.  If you're looking for a value Flash Memory Card, I might suggest SanDisk. ---  --- For one, Kingston does NOT make the best products, they are VALUE-driven products. ---  --- Two, there are competitors to Kingston with just as good or better value-to-performance ratios at the same prices. ---  --- Three, Kingston will not stand behind their customer as I have experienced. ---  --- I urge you to, please, be cautious of Kingston and their rebate scams
The product features are ok, but the screen is very small. Also, the resolution needs to be better. The photos were very grainy. An impressive looking product with not so impressive output
After reading so many positive reviews, I was very exited when I recieved this cd in the mail. I popped it in my bose wave radio, turned it up to 85, and listened to the most annoying hissing sound I've ever heard coming from my system. I regret purchasing this cd
Who would sell a treadmill for a weight limit of 250 lbs.???? --- Are only skinny people allowed to loose weight? --- Please - find a brain and make it those of us who REALLY need it
I purchased two of the 9-foot Oxford Garden Market Umbrellas in desperation; we were having a backyard party at our home and my local stores were all out.  When they arrived a short time later, I was very pleased to see how well made they were.  I especially like the pull cord to open and help close the umbrellas.  Not only are these umbrellas attractive, they are easy to use, study, and detail-oriented.  I'll probably get one more before the end of summer
This movie is possibly one of the best movies I have ever seen.  Christopher Nolan is a genius along with all of his other movies.  This movie is very unique and will never get old
A lot of reviewers share similar views, as seen in the recurrence of similar criticism of today's magazines.  What these complaints also have in common is that they can tend to be fairly uninformed in regard to certain issues.  First off, we all know that T+L is for "affluent travelers."  Read the publisher's description, and it will tell you just that.  So if you're not an affluent traveler, then don't waste your money on T+L and stick to Budget Travel.  T+L occassionally has "affordable" stories, especially in their affordable issue in March.  But don't expect the hotels to be to be under $200 a night.  You know why?  Because nowadays under $200 a night means you're a step above a youth hostal, especially in Europe where you pay an extra 20% on top of every dollar with today's exchange rate.  The point is that T+L never positioned itself as an affordable travel mag, so to criticize its shortcomings in that respect is an invalid complaint. ---  --- Anyone who claims the photography is blown out and out of focus hasn't picked up a copy of the magazine since 1999.  Furthermore, if all you saw were straightforward photographs of hotel rooms, you'd go out of your mind with boredom.  There's nothing wrong with adding a little art to your photography, after all photography is in fact art, and T+L does a pretty good job of that.  And so what if there's a beautiful woman in the photo.  No one's saying you have to look like her or promising that she'll be strewn across the bed in your hotel room.  Use your imagination - this is travel photography in Travel + Leisure magazine - it ain't Newsweek.  And with all of the other offensive problems with media today, only in America do people complain about too much skin. ---  --- Lastly, readers need to understand that magazines don't put in more ads for giggles.  A magazine is a business, and ad revenue is THE way a magazine earns money.  So the more ads they have, the more profit they have, the more money they have to pay better photographers and writers and hire more staff and do more research, etc, etc, etc.  No magazine is going to choose to throw away money in order to not offend its readers with fewer ad pages.  In fact, high ad content is an indication of a high circulation, which is an indication of reader satisfaction.  The more people a magazine reaches, the more companies want to advertise there. ---  --- The fact of the matter is that there is no perfect travel magazine in existence.  They are either too service heavy, or editorial fluff, or too scientific and adventure-y, or just a b-level publication.  T+L has its shortcomings, it has its top whatever lists and there's a lot of high-end service in there.  But it's stunning and has its share of well written and interesting articles
I got these for my 28 month old daughter for Valentines Day as she is fascinated by skating. They are a pain to put on, but she doesn't mind. They have "beginner" settings, which she used for the first hour and then it was on to the "expert" setting! What I like is all the safety gear come with them, so she knows that she has to wear it "all or nothing". These are great and seem to be safe and sturdy...with supervision, of course
If your a fan of progressive rock, you probably already know how good this CD is. In my mind it is the single greatest CD of all time (followed closely by Operation Mindcrime, any of the great Pink Floyd and Rush records) ---  --- My only complaint on this DVD, is the sound. I was at this show and the sound at the theater was great. Somewhere, it didn't transfer to the recording. It is not the worst thing I have ever heard, but it doesn't show the bands power live.  ---  --- Every other aspect of this DVD is well worth the price. I would not want to be with out it.
I used this razor for a few months and was happy with everything except the price of the blades. I have always cut myself occasionally, but when I cut myself with the Fusion Power, I got this huge cut under my chin that eventually left a scar! Talk about sharp! I went back to using it and then a month or so later I cut myself AGAIN and this one was even worse. You could almost see five lines of blood on the point of my chin. I tossed the Fusion in the garbage, went back to the 3-blade, and wrote Gillette an e-mail to complain, to which they did not respond. ---  --- I've read all 60 reviews before mine, and was surprised to see that no one else reported this problem. Maybe it's my shaving technique, but this thing is a weapon
The characters are uninteresting and 2-dimensional, the dialog hackneyed. I have no idea why it's on the New York Times Bestseller list. It was more of an obligation for me to finish this book than anything else. Don't waste your money
Some digital cameras have no viewfinder at all, but the Nikon 8400 has a "electronic viewfinder" and the reviews have been good and the price is great, so I bought the camera. ---  --- The electronic viewfinder turns out to be too dark to see the face of the person you are trying to photograph indoors with the flash, you cannot see any expressions, just the outline of the person's head, so you guess and shoot several times and then see the photos you just shot in the viewfinder.  Outdoors you cannot see enough detail in the viewfinder to know what you are including in your shot.  ---  --- The "display" LCD monitor is small and washes out in sunlight. ---  --- The background of the flash shots is unacceptably dark. ---  --- After 3 days of use and 90 shots I mailed it back to "Ritz on Amazon" this morning, Dec 5.  They require it back "within 10 days of receipt of purchase", their "date of order" was Nov 29 and it arrived at my house on Dec 3.  It's a good thing I already had a compact flash card to use, there is not one in the box and if I had waited for the one I ordered to arrive, well, it's not here yet.  It cost me $11.65 to return it, insured, with 2 day delivery and a "delivery confirmation receipt". ---  --- The camera had some strengths as well as it's weaknesses, but with only a short time to try it out before the "10 days" ran out and serious difficulty trying to see what I was shooting I gave up on it
The Wolf Man Legacy set a no brainer.Like all the classic Universal Legacy sets the special features are worth the price alone. Jack Pierce's Make up and Wolfman Creation are still the best! This set along with Dracula and Frankenstein Legacy collections enables you to see the entire series in order as sequels to the inferior but still hard to dislike monster rallies they would end with. You still need Abbott and Costello meets Frankenstein to truely complete the series
I can't say enough good things about this variety and brand of tea.  The bergamot and other citrus elements in the tea and the delicacy of the tannins make milk, sweetener or lemon completely unnecessary.  The color and aroma are just lovely, making this a fantastic treat for the novice or experienced tea drinker, and it has just enough caffeine to get me through tedious afternoons without making me jittery.  I carry the bagged variety everywhere I go
Material extremely thin and almost transparent when it is held up to light. It's very dissappointing for an Izod product.  I would have returned it had I not bought it for my 82 year old father whom discarded the packaging
Don't discount this film because you are dismayed by Tom Cruise. This film is excellent and a must see. The symbolism in this film alone makes it worth a look. Attempt to ignore good old Tom and rekindle your love for him pre-insanity. Kubrick rarely gets enough accolades for this movie, as he should
I was with Sprint for almost 10 years, all told. I had a picture mail account with them for about 3 years. Just recently, without any warning, whatsoever, they deleted over 500 of my precious pictures from my picture mail account...pics that had been accumulating and many of which had been safely and soundly sitting there for most of that period of time.  Most of these pics were VERY important to me and are now lost forever.(I had only backed up about 45 of them.) I guess it was my own fault for trusting Sprint, but they offered no real explanation and when I tried to have the pics recovered, not only could they not do that, but they said they had NO RECORD of me ever having the picture account that I had with them for almost three years!!! This is the worst thing any service company has ever done to me! So, my advice: DON'T TRUST SPRINT!!! Again, this happened with any warning! It could happen to you too! Trust me: avoid Sprint at all costs! I should have
This is a very cute bouncer chair.  However, I feel it was poorly designed.  It sets the baby almost laying down so it is difficult to play with the toys.  In addition, our baby has acid reflux and it was not a good chair for him because it sets him back too far.  We had to find one that set more upright
Heinlein loads this book up with hooks in the early pages to catch your attention.  Unfortunately, these hooks turn out to be superfluous and lead nowhere.  This shoddy technique is found in all four of Hienlein's final books.  We are also treated to some of Heinlein's stock characters, dirty old men, horny female computers, naked adolescent girls, and dominant beauties who would be right at home in leather and whips.  Without these archetype characters most Heinlein novels written after 1970 would have a sparse population indeed.  As if this isn't enough, Heinlein drags in his usual cast of characters from his other novels as he is so prone to doing.  In spite of all their cameo appearances, this group remains dull and one dimensional throughout.  Heinlein's earlier novels written prior to 1960 are still fine fare for young people, especially boys.  This novel, as well as most of Heinlein's later work will be enjoyed primarily by a group of die hard fans and is definitely not for general consumption
I loved the concept of this item, but it didn't live up to my expectations.  The top was extremely loose in the bra portion and provided no support.  The pants, however, were comfortable and I really loved them.   ---  --- The top needs to be reworked
"Being a lover of freedom, when the [Nazi] revolution came, I looked to the universities to defend it, knowing that they had always boasted of their devotion to the cause of truth; but no, the universities were immediately silenced. Then I looked to the great editors of the newspapers, whose flaming editorials in days gone had proclaimed their love of freedom; but they, like the universities, were silenced in a few short weeks.... Only the Church stood squarely across the path of Hitler's campaign for suppressing the truth. I never had any special interest in the Church before, but now I feel a great affection and admiration for it because the Church alone has had the courage and persistence to stand for intellectual and moral freedom. I am forced to confess that what I once despised I now praise unreservedly."  --- -- Albert Einstein.  ---  --- What I'm getting at here is that you can propogate anyone to look bad, that's easy. When you have two sources contradicting each other so heavily, you may want to consider the source; i.e a protestant british author writing over fifty years after the fact, vice a prominent and liberal jewish figure who lived through the holcaust and has no biased motive to either slander or praise the beforementioned institution. ---  --- Or maybe Israel Zolli, chief rabbi of Rome whose conversion to Catholicism immediately after the war was prompted by the church's reaction to the plight of the jewish people.  ---  --- This book is extremely propagated and heavily editorialized. It is important to read a work like this however, in order to better understand the manipulation of truth and half truth in the author's motive
This clock works great!  It automatically picks up the accurate time through radiowave.  It did not come with a product manual but easy to figure out.  All you have to do is selct your time zone button (PT, MT, CT, and ET) and put a new AA battery.  I agree with another review which mentioned that this clock is not made for durable construction. As a matter of fact, when I picked up the clock from the package, a tiny screw came off.  It was one of the screws to hold back body panel to the main body.  It has not affected to the function as well as the visual part, anyway, so it may not a big deal.  Overall, this clock is good enough for the price
I first tried this when my Mum bought a bottle during her holiday in November. The weather was cold, wet & dark at home. When I sprayed some on my wrists I wasn't impressed. ---  --- Come June & sunny, hot & bright days, I found myself trying `Just Me' in the shops & buying a bottle (which I'm quickly making my way through). ---  --- Lighter & easier to wear then `Paris Hilton', I'm using it all the time. Scent wise; the strongest note for me is the pink peppercorn - sharp & tangy. It contrasts nicely with the floral notes, so neither individual note overpowers me. ---  --- Overall `Just Me' can be worn anywhere during the day; work, shopping or lunch. --- For evening and autumn/winter look elsewhere.
Juliette Binoche is an amazing actress.  Since her Best Supporting Actress Oscar for "The English Patient" in 1996 and her nomination for "Chocolat," she's an actress whose films I seek.  "The Widow of Saint-Pierre" has a bit of irony to the title.  The opening frames show Binoche in black staring out of a window.  We then move into the flashback in which most of the film moves forward.  We learn that the "widow" is the guillotine that must be shipped by boat from France before the big execution can take place.  We see director Emir Kusturica in an acting role as the very large prisoner Neel whose rehabilitation Binoche's Madame La seeks.  We keep wondering if the black dress is saved for the prisoner.  Daniel Autereil who won a Cesar (French Oscar) for his work with director Patrice Leconte for "Ridicule" in 1996 plays the lovestruck Captain who is in charge of the execution.  Spurred on by his wild and unconditional love for his wife, he thwarts the town's sentence of death at every turn, refusing to allow his soldiers to help haul the widow ship to shore.  In the moment of ultimate irony, Neel volunteers to help bring the widow to shore, which is sure to result in his own execution.  The bloody resolution and the final shots of Binoche in black bring the story to its somber conclusion.  Patrice Leconte has a great reserve, shooting this excellent screenplay in period costume and letting the depth of his cast work its magic.  This is an incredibly tragic romance, one that works exquisitely.  Enjoy! 
I bought this exact case at the local mall and was told there was no refunds or exchanges.  Doh!  This crappy case broke within 3 weeks of use.  I only took it off approximately 3 times and babied it when I did.  No jostling or forcing the case.  The little prongs that held the front faceplate on broke and the teal metallic color started wearing after only this short time. ---  --- Do not buy this POS unless you want to throw your money out
My child loves this little crib.  I think the canopy was the winning feature and the rollers.  She can easily move it without having to carry it to the next room.   All her dolls fit the crib.  We really think it works.  It isn't as sturdy as a wooden crib, but it hasn't come apart on us
I love this key and cell phone set so much I'm buying another one for a friend.  I looked into the the recall and found that these keys were not part of the recall.  My 3 year old loves the recording feature on the cell phone.  (Actually even my older kids think it's pretty neat.)  Great product.. great price
after reading glowing reviews of the DBTs I picked up three of their cds. While some of the lyrics are strong, the songs have no melodies whatsoever. Most of the arrangements consist of guitars blaring over a terrible singer. They're reputed to be carrying on the tradition of Skynyrd and the Allmans. But those bands weren't just loud guitars...they had memorable tunes and great singers. DBTs are a huge letdown
I have really bad luck with head sets (I dropped a vise on my last set, really)these are really well built headphones, it always seems to be the mic or the volume control that goes bad, but on this head set they are all separate so if any one goes out then you still have a good head set. They can get very loud and not crack, exceptional base, and mic is very very clear. They are light but feel solid, although I have not put them to the vise test they seem you be strong. I have very big ears that is one of the reasons I bought this head set, it is very comfortable. The only thing I don't like is that they do not block very much sound because there are holes behind the ear cups, but maybe it help keep your ears cool, maybe. I really give them 4 1/2 stars. I paid about $90 for them and I have no regrets. So if you want a head set to use is a relatively quit environment these are good but if not go for the Sony mdr-300/mdr-400 they don't have mics but good headphones. --- Hope this helped, good luck
What a great mortar and pestle!  It was a gift for my father-in-law and it was better than he had expected.  He has used it extensively and is very happy with the results
After an elaborate theft scheme at the Cannes film festival goes terribly wrong Rebecca Romijn Ex-Stamos must go into hiding.She assumes a new identity but 7 years later a photographer threatens to expose her unless she can outwit him.Full of twists,deceit and secrets where nothing is as it seems don't expect a  plot or memorable performances.Rebecca is incredibly sexy but along with the rest of the cast she's just a pawn in DePalma's clever mindbender.A huge Hitchcock fan DePalma is best at stylish suspense scenes with no dialogue(like the 15 minute opening scene at the Cannes film festival in this film)and nicely includes elements of his and Hitchcock's previous films from Vertigo to Dressed to Kill.It's a lot of fun spotting the cinematic references and on repeated viewings you'll notice plenty of sneaky touches.If you're looking for an actionpacked straightforward suspense film you won't like Femme Fatale.If however you're looking for a twisty challenging film Femme Fatale will reward your attention
I saw this design and thought it was a great idea. After using it twice my wrists still hurt. Now I know why I couldn't find this design at my local sporting goods store
I had a small but noticeable dent in the fender and I wanted a cheap way to mostly fix it before committing to a full body shop. Dent King can do some jobs, but not all. For what it does, it's a pretty good product. If you fall into the category where it can help, it's worth it. ---  --- It's a "do it yourself" dent repair kit for your car. It "pulls" dents back out and is a fairly good solution for dents that ONLY require pulling "back out". This includes door and shopping cart dings you'd get in a parking lot. It has to be minor, no larger than a grapefruit, and only cosmetic dent damage to a metal panel where there is NO crease. It does not address scratches. ---  --- The ideal dent for the Dent King to repair is damage from a blunt object, like a rounded plastic corner of a shopping car dinged the middle of your door and left an indentation that is small, did not cause creases, not on a crease. ---  --- I think this is but one tool of an arsenal of tools that body shops use. That means, it is only applicable to a specific type of damage. If the dent looks like it just needs to be "sucked back out a bit", then the Dent King probably can help. ---  --- Clean the surface with the included cleaner, which smells like regular rubbing alcohol. Use the supplied glue gun and special glue sticks and dab the melted glue onto the end of the "puller" stick and adhere to the dent where you want to pull it. Allow it to cool, then straddle the "puller stick" with the 2 point brace/bridge, and screw on the tightener to the puller stick. This will pull on the dent via the stick until the glue pops off. This action "snaps" the dent out a bit; depending upon how much force the glue was able to supply. This relies on a good paint job (OEM), as it's essentially pulling on the surface of the paint. ---  --- It ends up you will need to do this multiple times to slowly work out the dent ---  --- I can still see my dents but they are greatly reduced; that is, for the ones that the Dent King could be applied to. I don't think "good as new" will ever be achieved with Dent King, but it definitely can reduce "ugly ding" to "little annoying ding". ---  --- This is one of those products that is just a tool, and really is more dependent upon the skill of the operator. For the price paid, it delivered  value for its cost. But that's it
 The wife and me each got a set and tried it out today. We were surprised everything was great quality and looked nice. The fins are great cut right thru the water. The snorkle is also great, kept water totaly out in waves and when diving. The mask was good/ok. You can't go wrong with this package. ---   Wish I would have got the other US Divers kit with the little better mask and same fins for a few bucks more. ---  --- We are happy. ---  --- Dan & Melissa
Everything a mechanic needs, without having all those little bottles and cans leaking every where. The sticks allow precise application of thread sealer or anti-seize. The sticks don't leak or spill, the y don't have nozzles that clog... they are perfect. No waste! ---  --- They were a good deal before but now with the new low price you can afford to get two kits!, buy this and you will not be sorry
If you want a deep gloss, a smooth finish, and paint protection, then you will love the NXT. But be advised, the NXT paste, is a better product than the liquid. They both give the same look, but the paste seems to last longer, because liquid have more solvants in them. The paste is not hard to use at all, and the secret is to ues a very Small amount. If you try caking it on, you will have a hard time getting it off, and you will end up with streaks. I have a silver frost Lincoln Town car, and the NXT brings out the metal flake in the paint. The car looks as good as it did when it was new, and it is currently three years old. The cost is a littie on the high side, but don't forget, if you want the best look, and protection, it wil cost you a little more. If you just want wax, get a bottle of a less expencive product ans call it a day. If you want the best look your can have, then use the NXT. YOU WILL LOVE THE RESULTS
It arrived fast enough, but I should have sent the chair back. It's pretty cheaply made, the ends are taped with what looks like regular scotch tape. It's OK, but I'll keep my eyes open for a better one. And we won't swing on it. I don't think it would take it.
I bought this w/ the hippo travel high chair.  It worked great and kept things cleaner.  Unfortunately it was in the case w/ the chair when it was stolen out of our truck. 
DVD newcomer "Fort Apache" (1948) looks great, with minimal wear on its crisp black-and-white images (from original nitrate elements) and bugle-brisk audio. The film, ironically, finds Henry Fonda playing the maddeningly hawkish cavalry commander against John Wayne's humanistic officer willing to risk all for peace and justice. ---  --- The (single) DVD has no documentary on the exciting and heartfelt film, a shame. It does include a 15-minute piece on Monument Valley, covering Ford's significant and seemingly beneficial role in the Indian reservation's history. The Navajo, paid good wages for their appearances, called him "Giant Soldier." "I've kissed more babies than a politician," Ford said. ---  --- "Part of his vision of the world was that we're all very small in the scheme of things," film historian Joseph McBride says. "I think (Monument Valley) gives a dimension of moral seriousness to his work that was intensified as he went along." --- [...
This DVR works ok.  But when it is recording, forget about changing channels.  It is really really slow and takes like forever to even receive any remote clicks.  --- Broadband feature is nice; but USB doesn't come cheap. Its like [...].

WHAT HAPPENED TO THE CLUE CHRONICLES? ---  --- First off, you may notice a couple of things: --- 1. This is called Clue CHRONICLES  --- 2. It is refered to as EPISODE 1 sometimes. --- 3. It is a 1999 game with no sequel --- Why is this? Well, Clue Chronicles was from Hasbro Interactive and EAI. EAI quit the gaming business and Hasbro quit computer games and was left with board games. So, the promising series was "doomed." If you enjoy this game, I advise you to write into Atari. Why Atari? Well, Hasbro was left with all their computer games. They passed all the rights to Infogrames, which became Atari. So, in the complicated and confusing Clue Chronicles Timeline, the rights are held with Atari. I will, and if you like the game you should too, write to Atari and ask for a sequel. Now, for the real review. ---  --- MY REVIEW: ---  --- Clue Chronicles follows the story of 11 unlucky party guests on a mysterious yacht owned by Ian Masque. After he drops dead, the mystery begins. Did a box kill him? So it seems...Join the old cast-Miss Scarlet, Mr. Green, Mrs. Peacock, Colonel Mustard, Professer Plum, and Mrs. White-along with a new cast of characters including-Marina Popov, Julia Kell, Sabata, Martin Urfe, and (for a short time) Ian Masque. You are a detective. Nobody has ever met this man is person, what did he want with them, and you? There is an answer. But you need to play the game to find it out. With an airtight plot that doesn't stop-even after the story ends-you will be gasping for breathe at the heartstopping cliffhanger ending! ---  --- MY GRADES: ---  --- Story 10/10-Well thought out with an unexpected ending --- Gameplay 6/10-Minor Glitches that don't effect the gameplay, but involve disappearing characters in the background --- Soundtrack-9/10-Music mostly fits the scenes --- VO 9/10-The voiceovers are great except for one small part towards the end --- Graphics 8/10-Its an old game-that about sums it up, no? ---  --- FINAL --- A- ---  --- Will always be a favorite..
You won't have to use much lotion on your body after using this product.  I love it....

I eat popcorn all the time and have used this salt for a couple of years.  I disagree that it has a chemical taste, but taste is always pretty subjective. If you like alternatives to salt, give it a try.
 Every time I was flipping the channels and Dutch was on I would end up staying on the channel and watching it.   I hated Married with Children so I was very suprised that I like this movie
I've been a BIG fan of MS keyboards and mice for years now, and the Desktop 7000 is the first huge disappointment.  I do love the design and the feel of the keys, but the keyboard is constantly issuing commands from the 'touch sensitive' areas when I don't even touch them (I type 120+ WPM).  In addition, the middle mouse button only fires 50% of the time, and the delay in the bluetooth is problematic for anyone who needs precision.  On top of that I began having USB stability problems when I started using their USB Bluetooth connector.  This is with Vista x64.  I've already returned one unit and am having the same problems with another, and will be returning it for a full refund.  Rumor has it MS is issuing a recall on certain units of this particular keyboard. ---  --- Oh, and there's a bug with the IntelliType software that renders the pause/play button for media useless in Vista... ---  --- Guess it's time to look for something else :
Razor blades are expensive enough as it is, and the trend of "more is better" has reached almost ludicrous points in the industry.  What's that?  Five blades, you say?  Why, it must be better than four!  Meh. ---  --- I have fine stubble which grows in at varying angles across my neck.  The good news is that, while other razors have always been unable to remove all of my stubble on the first try, this blade does, in fact, take care of the problem.  In addition to this, it aggravated the skin quite a bit (this might have as much to do with the vibrating action as with the five blades).  The precious soothing-aloe strip had little to no effect on my skin (particularly in the neck area).  If you have sensitive skin at all, this might not be the razor for you. ---  --- Contrary to the experience of others, however, the extra "trimming" blade worked well for me when getting the spots along the edge of my mouth, under my nose, and when shaping my vast hedge-like sideburns.   ---  --- However, the five blades on the other side dulled remarkably fast.  Considering my rather fine hairs, I'm used to exchanging blades once every week or so.  Now I'm exchanging them twice a week.  Seeing as how this product is already so much more expensive than competitors' products, and seeing as how it is designed to work exclusively with the Fusion razor (and vice versa), and seeing as how its lavish wealth of cutting action has clawed at my skin, I find it hard to recommend
I didn't have especailly high hopes for this book. I think there has been a gradual decline in the quality of HH books over the years, and this one brings it to a new low. Basically, it's waaaaaay too long. At 850 pages, it's a monster read, and a slow one. That's not always a bad thing - sometimes if you like the characters it's nice to just hang out with your friends for page after page. But not here. Why is it necessary to describe in detail the exact movements of a treecat using sign language? For several paragraphs? More than once? Why are we given pages of liturgy for religious services? I think I'd be in a very small minority when I confess that I quite like the 1662 Prayer Book, though I can't quite work out why it would be revived in the distant future when it's been out of use here for decades! Maybe it was easy to cut and paste, and got the word count up. ---  --- And then there's the space combat - a strength of the series, especially the first three or four. But there's the rub - there are only so many ways you can describe a spaceship blowing up. By the 11th book in the series I can't be the only person out there whose eyes are beginning to glaze over when we get to the battle sequences. ---  --- But the big problem - spoiler alert! - is the way in which Weber solves the love triangle we left the last book with. Honor loves Hamish. Emily loves Hamish. Hamish loves Honor and Emily. What to do? It turns out that there's an easy solution. After about 400 pages of agonising (not to mention most of the previous book) it seems that Honor can marry them both. A bit outre? Seemingly not - apparently such arrangements fall well within the accepted norms of Manticoran law and custom. (Although we've never had a whiff of this before.) But what really gets me is that the reason it didn't happen about halfway through the last book is that (get this), gosh, no-one thought of it. It seems that no-one ever told Mr Weber that if you shoot someone with a gun in Act V, the gun better have been hanging on the wall in Act I. ---  --- All-in-all, I can only say, please Mr Weber. It is time to bring the series to an end. Please do it soon
I absolutely love this product! It's been effective on both my natural and now permed hair. It's worth the price. I haven't found anything on the market to match it yet. 
It's doesn't look like as it appears in the photos...i bought it to gift  my husband and i wz very disappointed !! I returned it back !
I subscribed to Cooks Magazine some years ago, back when it  began publishing again.  I had problems with issues that failed to arrive, and wrote to them about it - never received a reply or any note of concern. ---  --- Since that time, I occasionally glance through it at newsstands to see if there are any articles of interest.  Even by dint of casual glance, I've begun to tire of the formulaic articles in which some drone tirelessly adds or deletes ingredients in order to finally come up with the "perfect recipe" for something or other.  I now skip right to the "perfected" recipe, and decide whether its worth committing to memory.  Some of the explanations for the success or lack thereof of the inclusion or exclusion of a particular ingredient are hare-brained at best. ---  --- There are also two other areas of this magazine that have disappointed me: ---  --- 1.  Product Reviews:  They range from just plain wrong to idiotic. ---  --- The KitchenAid Pro 600 was hailed by Cook's as the best in its class for many mixing chores.  Yet, the Amazon reviews tell a different tale - one of a short lifespan when used to mix bread dough because of a plastic gear cover that deforms and finally comes apart, allowing the metal gears to separate. ---  --- Christopher Kimball (the editor) once performed an evaluation of cookware in which he calculated the price of the cookware per pound of its weight.  No, I'm not joking.  In that evaluation, Le Creuset came out on top simply because it was heavy.  All-Clad, even though it conducts heat very evenly, suffered for not having as much heft, and therefore was judged pricey, on a pound weight basis. ---  --- One issue of Cooks boasted on its cover "Unsweetened chocolate -supermarket brand beats others".  Apparently, Hershey's was designated best.  Not too many months later, Callebaut was recommended above all others, and Hershey's was judged barely acceptable.  Feeling manipulated yet? ---  --- 2.  Finally, there are those dreadful editorials by Mr. Kimball.  Rambling, painfully written, and punctuated with a picture of Mr. Kimball wearing a bow tie, and looking very much as if his head were being held on by it. Mr. Kimball is a humble man, with much to be humble about.  He writes as if he were chanelling Helen Gurley Brown, but in red and black flannel watch-plaid and without her sense of play.   ---  --- Time to re-vamp this magazine, folks
both of my kids have a LeapPad and several books ... this is a great way to keep them all together.  It's durable and kid friendly--so they can keep track of their cartridges and books ... and it's great b/c they can just grab it and go which makes it nice for travel too
I and my wife have been very pleased with the Jeep Wrangler All-Weather umbrella stroller.  Unlike the cheap umbrella stroller we used to have, this one has better construction for the main folding support tubes. Plus, the handles are longer which means I (5'-1'' guy) don't have to walk like a neanderthal to push my toddler. The wheels do work pretty well on most surfaces even in very light snow.  The brakes are durable plastic and should last longer than my previous stroller. The pouches are an added plus for storing snacks or bus passes.  ---  --- My only disappointment has been the sun screen. It is not that useful for blocking the sun from my son's eyes unless I pull it directly in front of him. At that point, he can't see anything. That's OK if he falls asleep, but otherwise he (an independent todler) will pull the sunscreen off if it blocks his view. ---  --- An added bonus would be a shoulder strap that I could use to carry the stroller for walking more than a few feet. While it's light and compact for a stroller, it is still cumbersome to carry if you have to fold it on the bus or walk anywhere with it. Frequently my son wants to walk so I take the stroller with me because I know he'll get tired. So again, a shoulder strap would make toting the stroller much easier
I affirm the positive comments of the other reviewers. I am a truck driver and dairy farmer and just finished the books on tape version of this book. I want to run away to graduate school and get at PHD in physics. I hated science in school. ---  --- I especialy recommend this book because it affirms  true learning. It really doesn't start until you fall in love with a subject and go after it just for the fun of it and for the most part on your own. Much of the book is about his love of physics and scientific exploration. He touches upon how to do education wrong with his stories about science education in Brazil and his  work selecting K-12 science texts for the LA school system. My independent road of becoming a dairy farmer affirms his thinking, and I am so glad I did not try to get an Ag degree
Shawn Hatosy (The Faculty, Outside Providence) is in love with Rachael Leigh Cook (She's All That, Antitrust) but she doesnt love him, she only wants to be his friend, then enter Hatosy's friend, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers (Tv's Elvis, Velvet Goldmine) who becomes Cook's boyfriend and Hatosy becomes jealous from this....who hasnt gotten made when a friend seduces the girl you love....you know what, who cares really. Hatosy tells the story in flashback telling the story to cop Lorraine Bracco (The Sopranos, Medicine Man). This boring story has no likable characters and invokes really thin interest with me. Cook is really stale, Hatosy, as much as a good actor he is is rendered dull and Meyers plays another sleaze ball like in most of his thrillers. Worth a look and by god Im not looking again and towards the end you're like....WHY I DID I RENT THIS?!!. Also starring Estella Warren (Planet of the Apes remake).
Please be aware of an important issue with this cable, even though it is recommended for the eTrex GPS series it will not fit their flat 4 pin connector. --- I had to return mine and bought one at the local REI --- 
I enjoy reading books of trivia and fun facts, but I didn't even make it through the first chapter before I put this book down in disgust. Almost every entry had to do with sex or male endowments. As I was flipping through the book, I found x-rated pictures and drawings that I would hate to have to explain to my children if they were to pick up this book. I never would have bought this book if I had seen it in a bookstore, and I regret throwing it in the trash before I could see if I could get my money back
After reading several digital photography books, and going to grad school classes... I found this magazine to be far superior to anything published in this country.  There are many articles on artists, workshop-type tutorials, as well as the latest and most fantastic hardware and software for the digital fan.  I believe this magazine has something for everyone... from beginner to more advanced at relatively low cost.  In addition, I have found two other British publications, Digital Camera World, and Digital Photography Techniques (both at www.dcmag.co.uk), that I would strongly recommend for those who can afford them
Ick.  I bought Ultra Light Kirsch because I thought it would be similar to a discontinued grapey color that I used to love by Loreal. ---  --- Smell - Fake grade-school grape-aid smell grossed me out. ---  --- Feel - I LIKE lip gloss that feels glossy.  This stuff did not shine enough or last long enough. ---  --- Color - The color was to mild for me.   ---  --- I was very disappointed.  I felt like I had wasted money and time. I still recommend Loreal Lip Juice, though. I believe it's the same company, and Lip Juice is glossy, shiny, long-lasting and way more cost-effective
This thing is amazing.. My Plasma is like a whole new tv.. My 60" Sony SXRD paired with a PS3 is the best looking picture I have ever seen, after using the STV100. This is a must have
I first purchased this watch in 1994 when I entered the selection coarse to be an Air Force CCT.  I lost the watch years later but I would occasionally try to find a replacement with no luck.  I now work for US DOJ and will be deployed to Baghdad for a while and I need a watch I will be able to absolutely depend on in extreme conditions.  This is the only watch I will ever own.  I cannot say enough about it.  Maybe I'm sentimental but I love this watch
I have been looking for an easier way to protect the front my my lens without having to either take off my lens hood or trying to fumble around with the lens cap with the hood still on.  Op/Tech came up with the solution!  All you have to do is stretch the proper size hood hat over the hood and everything is protected and ready to go.  Super easy to take off, putting on takes a little more time, but you never miss a picture putting it on anyway.  Basically this is an inexpensive way to add some extra insurance against getting dirt, water, etc on your front element while you are walking around looking for shots.  It is also very flexible and easy to stick in a pouch or pocket when not being used
I purchased these skates for my Grand-daughter and she just loves these skates. I thought that with her being only 4 years old she would not be able to pop out the wheels but she did it and off she went. She tries to wear these skates everywhere
I bought this watch as a gift for my boyfriend, and he was pleasantly surprised to say the least.  The human-powered kinetic movement of the watch really appeals to the gadget lover in any guy, and the sapphire crystal face of the watch will not scratch.  Although I bought the black-faced Kinetic Coutoura Seiko, the gold/silver version of this watch is lovely also.  Great quality, gorgeous appearance, reasonable price - definitely consider this watch
I bought this for my wife because of it's low cost. You get what you pay for. She uses it a few times a week. After a little more then a month, the left pedal broke. She is not overweight at all, so that wasn't the problem. --- I'll spend the money for a good one next time
I opened my falling in love compact expecting a lovely smell after reading the hype.This is the worst smelling perfume-ever.When I put it on it smelled like burnt clothing-like an iron had just done it's worst on cotton.It was so awful I put it straight in the bin
 I picked this up in a bootleg store in Korea a few years back, since it was cheap, and I had loved the movie (perhaps more so than any other of Mallicks's others, even - speaking of which, if you get a chance to see Badlands on the big screen, do yourself a huge favour and do so). ---  ---  As I recall, I didn't really enjoy it on first listen. But then, somehow, I got sucked in. Almost as much as the film itself, this is a hypnotic, haunting slice of poetry. Nothing happens for about a minute, and then it builds and builds.  ---  --- Unforgettable, otherwordly and quite beguiling.  ---  ---  The structure of the soundtrack (especially the songs toward the end featuring Polynesian gospel-style singing) is strongly reminiscent of the Mike Oldfield cd, 'Songs of Distant Earth'. Highly recommended, but do give it a couple of listens, because it might take a while to make its charms felt
Its a good accessory for Archos product, I have 604 wifi. Its compatible with generation 4 Archos devices.  --- Pros: --- 1) Good build --- 2) Enough connections to expand ---  --- cons: --- 1) It very much costly as compare to it utility. --- 2) It comes with charger which should be a part of standard item. --- 3) There could be more cables included in this package like SPDIF, USB Mini cable. --- 4) In this cost it could have a backup battery (extra) that could be part of (built in) the Docking station, so that Archos device can have longer play time.  ---  --- I think Archos has a built in mentality of making as much as money they can, if it is then it would not go a long
More wonderful and inspiring poems. Time to be still and thoughtful
Though it may lack some of the integrated tools of Quicken or other financial software, MS Money continues to be the best entry level software of its genre and the best value for the money.  Particularly notable is the ease of integrating it with your on-line banking tools to create a one stop shop for your financial needs
This camera is a waste of money and should be taken off the market.  After purchase we were never able to retreive pictures.  The computer would recognize the camera but stated that no pictures were available to download.  It not only is difficult to use but not even an adult could figure out how to take a picture and this product is made for a child.  The instructions are complicated and eventually you give up.  Even putting in the batteries is complicated and you need a screwdriver (the smallest one you can find) to achieve it.  Unfortunately, I have wasted my money but luckily you don't have to
The clean, crisp smell of this 3-in-1 product will wake you up in the morning and keep you smelling fresh without overdoing it.
I own all of Bebo Norman's CDs, and I LOVE all of them, except for this one.  I bought it and listened to it once, and I hated it.  It does not sound like Bebo.  This sounds like Steven Curtis Chapman or Michael W. Smith or any of the other mass produced Christian/pop music artists.  On all of his previous albums, even though he changed his sound slightly, it was still generally very acoustic and Bebo-ish.  This album sounds nothing like his previous music.  I was disappointed. 
- --- The barrel of this pen is all stainless steel, which looks nice but feels slippery as you're trying to write.  Parker makes the same pen with a plastic barrel, which is easier to grip but looks less sleek.  In other words, there is a tradeoff between looks and functionality, in my opinion.  This is an excellent pen in every other way, with solid build quality, sturdy clip, and confident push-button mechanism.  Parker's ballpoint refill, which was reformulated sometime around 2002, is the best I've used, beating Montblanc, Pelikan, Cross, PaperMate, and BIC ballpoint refills in terms of smoothness, consistency, and smudge resistance.  For me, this pen (with plastic barrel) is the ideal ballpoint for everyday, all-purpose use.
THIS ITEM SMELLS LIKE LEMON PINE SOL. IT IS NOT WHAT YOU THINK YOU ARE PAYING FOR. ITS NOT WORTH THE MONEY.
Sumac is a great spice, used all over the middle east.  Try it as the Persians do - sprinkled over steamed Basmati rice and grilled kababs.  Or for a Lebanese style breakfast, cook eggs sunny side up in olive oil and sprinkle with Sumac.  Perfect with some warm pita bread
This is the 3rd, and unfortunately final, chapter in the triology.  I got my husband to run out and buy it the Tuesday it was released and finished it within 2 (very late) nights of reading.  If you have read the 1st two books you will not be disappointed with this one.  If anything, it is the best in the series with 2 really likeable characters - Yo! And if you haven't read "Caught Stealing" and "Six Bad Things", head to Borders now so you can read them before "A Dangerous Man".  Plan on not doing anything else for awhile because these books are just too intense to put down.  Pulp noir at its' finest
I've had my Tracfone for about 5 months now. The reception has been generally good. Once i got the phone activated, I haven't had any problems. Tracfone has a 'refer a friend' program that will give each of 100 free minutes. All you have to do is send me an email asking for a referral. My email is debsclay@gmail.com  --- thank you
This edition of the film sucks and sucks again. The wide screen version of this is a Masterpiece - without the widescreen ratio this edition cannot be true to the comic book sensibility that Bava intended.  Each shot was carefully composed(and not intended to be butchered) - this edition is a travesty -- especially when it's purported to be put out by fans - do you're homework. There are also scenes missing from this print, scenes that are important and add to the overall ambience. Hey I thought the folks behind this were enthusiasts -- instead its just sloppy and self indulgent. Look for the earlier laser disc edition ........... as for the extras do we really need the - it's great because I used it in my video slop .... and it's great because I did a bad homage/rip-off slop. The documentary in the extras takes great pains to point out that this film was intended to look like a comic book and that's what was great about it. Then when you watch the film what you get is less than a third of the original image! Strikes me a total scumminess. All in a all a fabulous opportunity wasted ... by a few lazy lard-asses with a quick-fix mentality.
Great product---what else can I say? While I lived in the caribbean, I ordered food since it was too expensive to buy good quality food there
I have this seat for my 4 month old and I love it... Yes it is larger than your average infant car seat but I have no problems getting it in and out of my car which is a Toyota Avalon not the smallest car on the market but certainly not the biggest... With my daughter who is 5 when she moved to the convertible car seat the biggest downfall was having to wake her up to get out of the car... Graco has made it so that I no longer have to do this. My son is nearly 20lbs already and had I been using your average infant seat I would have to buy him a new one already... Bravo to Graco for making a seat with extra weight/height limits... Another perk is it has the canopy so the sun isn't in his eyes which I also wouldn't get if he were in a convertible car seat. ---  --- My one and only complaint is that the fabric isn't breathable so my son sweats a lot in this seat but I just put a receiving blanket between him and the seat and he is fine... This in itself isn't enough to make me trade this seat for another
I purchased this product in hopes of a wonderful nights sleep. Well folks this is not what happened at all. I turned on my Conair SU1W and snuggled under the covers after a very stressful day. About 5 minutes into my relaxation I almost received heart failure due its soothing sounds of a train wreck. The volume which seemed to have been controlled by Satan reached top volume, although I never had touched it myself. I tried to turn it down and the volume still was blaring. I unplugged and plugged it back in numerous times, and still it would not work
Our granddaughter loves her horse necklace!  She wears it all the time and is so proud of it!  This necklace made her very happy
This is a great (and relatively cheap) way to expand your Brio starter set.  A nice selection of straights, curves, and a few switch tracks that really add to the interaction / fun.   ---  --- While Brio in general is expensive, this track pack represents a pretty good value (v. buying switches, curves, straights, etc on their own.... although you'll "need" to do that eventually too!). ---  --- The finish, fit, and quality is great.  Worth the money considering the play it'll get & it's durability
I am very dissapointed with this DualDisc, because there is no comment (worning) about DVD region protection. What can I do with this disc - region 1, in Europe (region 2)? My message for Sony Corporation is: "This format will not exist for long with DVD region protection! Sorry.". --- My first, and last DualDisc. Back to the SACD
I have been a Smart Money subscriber for over three years. I must say that each month I look forward to receiving the new issue. It needs to be said (to those who aren't aware) that this is a publication of the Wall Street Journal. There isn't as much market news but the writing is just as good. From undervalued stock picks, to mutual fund screening and research, finding cheap bottles of good wine, car ratings, retirement planning and portfolio health - this magazine hits on many important topics for people in their working years. I find the writing to be accurate and insightful. I would still be a subscriber if the subscription was $3 per issue. That's the true value I find in it. Hands down it's the best personal finance magazine around. Head and shoulders above Money & Kiplingers
I received this set at a baby shower back in 2005.  It has held up really well.  My only advice: with a retail price of $232.00 and even an Amazon price of $152, it's still too steep.  I never had the quilt in the crib because it is dangerous to do so with a baby - and he was constantly napping, so I hardly ever "made" the bed.  Next time around, I'm going to find a pattern I like and just buy all of the decorative things associated with it, then buy an inexpensive and plain bumper and sheet. The room itself is what you and everyone else sees.  The bedding is almost impossible to see, unless you're hovering over the crib.   ---  --- I do especially love the lamp, switchplate, mobile and 5-pc wall hanging from this collection.  You could buy all the accessories to truly create a safari room for less than the cost of the bedding alone.
Great product that works exactly as described. I have not used this as a stand-alone label maker; I've only used it with my computer. The software is fairly easy to use, and it will pull data from an Excel spreadsheet, which is a definite plus. I had a spreadsheet of over 300 items for which I needed to make labels, and linking to the Excel doc made the process very quick and convenient. The only complaint I have is that the tape for the label maker is rather pricey. I spent $40 on the label maker, and so far I've spent $60 on tape
I sent these for my cousin (who has everything!)on her 16th Birthday.  When i saw them later they were smaller than I expected----but she wears them everyday and they look very cute and understated.  They are a nice color and look better than cheap silver ones.  Plus if you are like my cousin and your ears get irritated with anything but gold--I would recommend these
Never guess these are wheat free!  Whole family loves them.  Will continue to purchase
I bought this tuner to use with my daughter's new violin.  It is doing a good job.  Sometimes it gives a strange note reading but trying the same string again usually gives an accurate reading.  It is an inexpensive model for people like me who don't have a good ear for a pitch pipe and don't want to spend a lot of money on a tuner.  I can't compare it to other tuners, because it is the only one I have tried.  My daughter's teacher tried it and he said it was fine.  I would recommend it for someone needing a functional, inexpensive tuner
Boring, tasteless and unoriginal. Photographer has an obvious fixation...which has kept him from paying attention in many cases to contrast, tone, and line. One star for the big you know what, the real model here. I'm sure book has its merits, but they aren't artistic. Putting my copy up for sale
This game is pretty cool u are in a 4 man squad made up of you the Leader (Orange) Scorch the demoshing guy (yellow) Fixer the guy who hacks into stuff (green) and Sev the sniper (red). I in this game it basicly is the battle of geonsis and wht happens from there to eposode 3. And amazingly it is almost just like halo! Ad in some parts has more blood to it like when you stab a alien with your knife the blood shoots on your visor (yes this game has more than robots). anyhow this game is becoming out dated so by it here. you'll love it 
I was happy to order this early so they wouldn't run out, but I later saw the same set at a local store. There was only one left on the shelf, so I'm glad I ordered them anyway. They are my youngest son's favorite cars to start off with every morning
High ISO and large screen were the reasons for my purchase. The screen is great but, when you force the ISO 1600, it seems to darken the pictures more than in 800. I have a S5200 and that one seems to adjust other options like white balance much better when an ISO is set w/o having to go to full Manual option. Definitely something to improve! The auto option seems to work much better and I was surprised with how good the high speed three frame shooting works. Also, the two picture function(it takes two with slightly different sets automatically) saves me on a lot of 're-posing
NWA was an original rap group and with that being said, this is definitely a must have album for rap lovers. Along with Public Enemy, NWA christened their genre with hard core lyrics and tight bass beats. Although I don't agree with some of their lyrics, one would not expect this white kid to fully understand their view on life. Anyways, buy this album, I recommend it. Keep it away from the kiddies though
This frame looks great until you turn it on. The picture quality is less than stellar, but that isn't what annoyed me about this frame. When you buy this frame don't expect to view your photos at the 16:9 ratio without some work in a photo manipulation program. What does that mean you ask? That means that your photos won't fill the entire screen in the 4:3 mode. You will have 2 black bars on either side of your images; This will not take advantage of the entire frame. If you switch to the 16:9 mode your images will stretch to the width of the frame, making peoples faces distorted. I have a workaround for those who are familiar with image manipulation. See below. ---  --- The build quality of the frame is pretty good. If Mustek would fix the 16:9 problem and get a better quality screen, this would be a nice little frame. ---  --- A little work is evolved setting up the pictures for the 16:9 ratio, but I figured it out. 16:9 stretches the image, making it look distorted. These steps compensate for the stretch and make your images appear normal. I set up a macro in Photoshop allowing me to do a batch in one click of the mouse. You will just need to keep an eye out on how it crops the image. Some of your images might be better served one at a time. ---   --- Start with an image that is 1024x768 in your image editing program. ---   --- 1. Go to the image size menu and change the width of the image to 77% (or 788 pixels) ---   --- This will make the image look distorted. That is ok. ---   --- 2. Then go to the canvas size menu and crop the height of the image to 77% (or 591 pixels) ---              --- The image is ready to save. You might want to save as in to another folder so you --- can go back to your original if needed. ---   --- 3. Copy your edited images on to the flash card and insert into the frame
What a disjointed mess, talk about cashing in on fame.  All he did here was take a bunch of columns he wrote in the paper and called it a book.   I could have done better with the letter to the editor section of the paper.  I was not that enamored with Liar's Poker and this book has done it for me with this author.   It was just that the articles were not that relevant any more and his writing is not that good
Installed this on my laptop and desktop computers.  One installation was late in 2005, the other was in 2nd quarter of 2006.  Both have tried to fail.  The laptop will no longer do automatic updates.  I can manually download and install the updates, but it is a bit of a hassle.  The desktop will no longer download the Symantec updates at all.  I attempted several uninstalls and reinstalls, won't do it.  The only remedy is to take both computers to a computer shop and needlessly pay someone to fix the mess this junk software has made on both computers.  Because of the problems, I've run into several problems, mostly related to .cab files when I attempt downloads.  I've switched to AVG and Zone Alarm - both FREE and they work
If you've been living under a rock for the past year or so, perhaps you can be excused for not having heard about Microsoft's new edition to the  --- Windows canon.  For all others, Vista has become a fact of life, whether or not you actually run the operating system yet.  Check out a tech website and you'll find a Vista screen shot somewhere, either depicting some impressive overclocking results via CPU-Z, or else simply for no other purpose than to show the world, "Yes, I can run Aero--aren't you jealous?"  In fact, it's hard to avoid Vista these days.  And, as always seems to be the case, most of what you hear is probably negative. ---  --- That's where I come in.  I've waited a while before writing this review, both to test the operating system and to wait for the horror stories to fade away.  They haven't.  And this can only mean one thing: the positive stories aren't getting through because most people who are satisfied with a product generally don't feel the need to comment on it.  Now of course you've probably seen quite a few anxious posts (most likely in all capital letters) either bashing Microsoft for everything under the sun, praising Vista indiscriminately, making it seem as though you need a $5000.00 enthusiast-class computer to run the thing, or boasting about Mac's venerable OS X and how Windows Vista is nothing more than a bad copy thereof.  Needless to say, none of these sorts of things helps, and all of them create a sense of confusion and negativity that reflects heavily on the product.  And, if you analyze them closely, you'll realize that *none of them actually says anything about Windows Vista.*  If you don't believe me, then just go visit Apple's discussion area and check out the iPod pages.  You'd get the impression that iPods were the worst products ever made and that every single one has problems.  Yet, if this were the case, then why have in excess of 100 million units been sold thus far?  The answer is obvious: people seem compelled to review products only if something went wrong with their experience.  In short, people confuse review sites with complaint forums. ---  --- Therefore, as the self-proclaimed Dr. Prog, I feel it my duty to step out of my usual mode of reviewing progressive rock albums and give an honest, no nonsense review of Microsoft Windows Vista Home Premium. ---  --- -THE INTERFACE- ---  --- Ah, yes.  You've heard all about the new Windows Vista Aero interface by now.  And virtually every screen shot you'll ever see will feature Aero.  But it's much more than just pretty, glass-like window frames.  Aero includes many new enhancements to the UI, such as the live thumbnails that appear when you mouse-over minimized windows.  As the name suggests, these actually update in real time, so if there is a video or an animation playing in the window, it will appear in the live thumbnail.  This is very useful.  Perhaps less useful but scoring about an 8 on the 1-10 "coolness factor" scale is the oft-mentioned 3D-Flip, which allows the user to view a three-dimensional representation of all open windows, along with offering the ability to virtually paw through these to bring the desired window to the forefront.  These are the things you'll hear the most about. ---  --- What you don't hear so much is all the general changes that have been made to the overall interface.  The new icons are photo-realistic and size-scalable.  They start out a little large, but you can set them to any size within a wide spectrum.  The explorer windows have been radically redressed, with a new breadcrumbs backward navigation tool that beats the old address bar hands down (you can retrace your steps in a logical, step-by-step manner, instead of using the cryptic addresses).  Also, they're spruced up with decorations that recall the visual aura style of some of the new wallpapers.  Speaking of which, these are for the first time actually usable, unlike in previous versions of Windows, where the wallpapers have been small and grainy. ---  --- More general changes include the absence of menu bars in most areas of Explorer, including IE.  These can be replaced momentarily with a tap of the Alt key, at least until you learn how to navigate without them.  Also, the animations are much better than in previous versions of Windows, particularly the one you see when copying a file.  In addition, the Start menu has been reworked drastically.  It doesn't even say "Start," anymore; instead, it's simply a blue orb with the Windows logo.  The first big change is the way programs are accessed: gone is the delicate and finicky ever-expanding hierarchy system, where a slightly overzealous hand could miss the mark and close the entire desired level.  Now, the All Programs button leads to an Explorer-like listing of folders, each clearly named, and each of which opens and closes with a single mouse click.  Each time the Start menu is opened, the folders reset themselves.  Also, they are automatically alphabetized.  The Start menu also contains most of the system links usually found on the Desktop (Computer, Documents, etc.), which is why the only thing on the Desktop the first time you boot up is the Recycle Bin.  And, in case you have seen screen shots or have tried out Vista already, the search bar at the bottom pulls double duty as a replacement for the Run command utility. ---  --- Speaking of search, though I seldom ever find myself wondering where my files are (I suppose I'm unique in this respect), many people have far more data to keep track of than me, and thus they will greatly appreciate the enhanced and pervasive searching facilities of Vista.  There are search boxes virtually everywhere in Explorer, including the Start menu.  There is even one in IE7, though it is not integrated with the system search. ---  --- But, as you've probably noticed, this is but a list of interface changes and additions.  I assure you the list could go on and on, and I know I'll receive more than one comment reminding me about some feature or other I've forgotten.  I'll read those when they come and add material as necessary.  But, aside from this, how does this new interface really impact the end user?  To be perfectly honest, though it's certainly pretty and a few parts of it required a little adjustment, it didn't feel much different from previous Windows versions to me.  But, to be honest, this is a good thing.  Perhaps you've heard that it's a nightmare to learn Vista.  That's a load of hogwash.  A few things are renamed, a few things have been moved around, and on the whole everything looks prettier.  But it's still Windows; it accomplishes the same tasks and it works virtually the same as it always did. ---  --- -INCLUDED SOFTWARE BUNDLE- ---  --- Taking a hint from Apple, Microsoft has included a compliment of digital media manipulation software.  While of course iLife is superior, there is one issue that must be cleared up: iLife is not an integral part of Mac OS X as you may have been led to believe.  Older Mac users must purchase it; it only comes with the newer Macs.  Therefore, Microsoft Windows Vista, to be purely technical, offers the most comprehensive digital media suite ever offered stock with an OS.  However, technicality is seldom practical, and Microsoft's inclusion is no iLife killer.  Still, the included calendar (new in Vista), photo viewing and editing application (new), Windows Media Player 11, Windows Movie Maker, and Windows DVD burning program (new) are nothing to scoff at.  No, they won't replace dedicated, professional stand-alone programs, but let's be honest: neither will iLife. ---  --- The new Internet Explorer 7 is a step forward from the piece of Swiss cheese IE6 was, insofar as security.  New features include a phishing filter, tabbed browsing, and improved security.  Additionally, IE7 runs in protected mode, also called a "sandbox."  The idea is that this one application is cordoned off from the rest of the system, thereby making it more difficult for malicious software to take control of your computer.  But that's more for the security section of the review.  The new IE7 is certainly more attractive than the older versions, and the version in Vista offers enhanced visual appeal that the XP port of the software lacks.  To be perfectly honest, I still use Mozilla Firefox (mostly because I can't stand those blinking ads on Web pages, and there is a Firefox extension that gets rid of that annoyance once and for all), but if I had to, I would have no qualms using IE7.  ---  --- The new incarnation of Window Media Player is really no different from the XP port.  It still doesn't support AAC, and it still doesn't handle gapless playback.  As an iPod user and a progressive rock fan, respectively, I can gather only one thing from these shortcomings: it's time to break out iTunes.  Don't get me wrong: WMP is not at all a bad tool.  It's still the default player on my system for most audio types.  However, once an iPod owner and prog rocker, always an iPod owner/progger.  I still say iTunes is king, if only because its interface is cleaner, it supports my audio device, and it offers gapless playback. ---  --- I haven't extensively tested the Windows Movie Maker application, but I have read that it is updated very slightly from the XP version.  The photo  editing tool is completely new for Vista, and after a little experimenting I was pleased that, though simple, the controls offer nice results.  This  application is on par with many of the basic image editing software packages you'll see offered with digital cameras, printers, and the like.  The other applications have yet to receive my testing, only because I don't often burn DVD movies, and I haven't entered an event in a calendar in about ten years. ---  --- As far as Windows Mail, I cannot be objective because I have never used Outlook or Outlook Express.  Reports seem to indicate that Windows Mail is simply a dressed-up Outlook Express, with many of the same features.  As I said, I have never used a mail program.  Call me old-fashioned, but I just check and write my mail from my Internet browser.  Either way, I don't honestly believe Microsoft would offer Outlook-level functionality in the stripped down version of Outlook 2007. ---  --- All in all, I was rather impressed at the steps Microsoft has taken to embrace the digital media age.  The effort falls short of iLife and proprietary solutions in this regard, but then, that is simply to be expected.  I haven't really benefited tremendously from the new additions, but there is certainly nothing wrong with them, and I know many people will be very happy with this digital media suite. ---  --- -SECURITY- ---  --- This is the big picking point many people (rightfully) have with Windows XP.  It seems as though there's at least two critical security updates every week.  The Mac commercials definitely have a point, but that's only because Macs make up so small a percentage of the market share (though it is indeed a growing share) that it is not advantageous for malware to be written for OS X users.  Even so, XP doesn't get a free pass here.  Something had to be done.  And that something was the security measures taken in Windows Vista. ---  --- The "sandbox" has already been mentioned above, but other features have been added.  One of these, Windows Defender (Microsoft's anti-spyware program), is one of those rare pieces of software that is just perfect: It may not be the best at what it does, but it's unobtrusive, it's simple to use, and it's totally and completely free.  Leave it on to supplement your already existing spyware solution, and you can only benefit. ---  --- Also featured in Vista is the now infamous User Account Control (UAC).  Basically, it prompts you every time your computer does basically anything, including installing programs, running some programs, updating settings, etc.  And, if you were wondering, the Mac commercials have it right: It really is that annoying.  To be fair, you will see far fewer of these alerts once the bulk of your software has been installed, but until then you will be very, very sick of UAC.  I don't advise this, but since I was able to get my anti-virus and anti-spyware software up and running on Vista, I finally turned off UAC.  Symantic seems to think this was unwise, but Norton Virus Scan doesn't bother me about it other than to recommend, on its information page, that I leave UAC activated.  Yeah.  Like that's going to happen. ---  --- Beyond these broad, tangible aspects of security, there is a lot of new stuff under the hood of Vista that makes it less susceptible to malicious attacks.  Mostly, unless you're very savvy, you don't need to understand it all and, to be frank, don't ask me because I haven't the foggiest how it all works.  I'm just glad it's there. ---  --- Overall, I think Microsoft has made a valiant effort with security.  I would still not advise running any Windows operating system without active virus and spyware protection, but at least Vista has taken a step in the right direction.  Plus, you likely have anti-virus and anti-spyware software from running Windows XP, which you can then install on Vista. ---  --- -THE HARDWARE- ---  --- Graphics: ---  --- This is the part I have been waiting for.  Everything I read up until I finally installed Vista told me I needed a dedicated graphics card with at least 256 MB of memory in order to run Aero.  I'll be honest: I fell for it.  I had a graphics card *in my hand*, but on the way to the checkout I realized I had left my gift certificate at home.  So I decided to wait and see how my hardware would react.  This is where I realized the utter bias among the tech community: I had absolutely no trouble running Aero on integrated graphics.  And that only makes sense because my setup is rather typical: a 17" flat panel monitor and a modern computer.  This will be what the majority of people have at the moment, and at this size, IG should have no trouble running Aero.  Now use logic: If you want to run dual 24" widescreen monitors, yeah, you'll need a graphics card.  Especially since I don't believe there even exists a dual monitor-capable IG motherboard (if there is such a thing, it's certainly not available on the OEM consumer market).  But if you have a fairly typical single monitor scenario on a computer that you bought within the past few years, you should have no trouble at all insofar as graphics.  Don't be fooled.  If you want to be absolutely sure, however, there is no harm--and plenty of good sense--in downloading Microsoft's free Upgrade Advisor utility to see if your setup is in any way deficient.  Plus, if you find you can't run Aero for any reason, you were going to upgrade to Vista anyway, so you  can still buy dedicated graphics at that point.  You don't need the top-of-the-line card unless you want to make this an excuse to foray into gaming; older technology that will get you up and running can be had for very reasonable prices. ---  --- RAM: ---  --- There is one area, however, where many computers will be deficient: RAM.  Oddly enough, while many sources are pushing the graphics card brigade, an almost equally strong force--the computer manufacturers themselves--seems to think that RAM is no big deal.  Trust me: If you've ever tried to run Windows XP on 256 MB of RAM, it's a painful experience.  That's what Vista is like on 512 MB--you don't even want to go there.  Dell is shockingly honest when they qualify the "minimum" Vista requirement of 512 MB of RAM (as per Microsoft) as "Great for booting the operating system, without running any applications or games."  This is where most people will have to upgrade their machines.  1 GB is perfectly acceptable; if you want true multitasking power (and you have the dual-core processor to support it), then go for 2 GB or more.  For most people, however, 1 GB will be fine.  My first of two Vista machines has 1 GB and it works perfectly.  I will warn you, though, that often times memory is installed in pairs, so your 512 MB is most likely two 256 MB modules.  The paired method offers better performance, but it will make upgrading a system with only two memory slots somewhat expensive (though not exorbitant by any means).  But this is not somewhere you want to skimp, so at least one pair of 512 MB memory modules should be on your list of extra hardware if you have only 512 MB of memory currently installed. ---  --- Processor: ---  --- This is perhaps the most accurate in terms of the hype.  You'll need at least a 1 GHz processor to run Aero.  Many computers with such processors don't even support 1 GB of RAM, so if you're in that situation, you will definitely be looking at a new computer with Vista pre-installed.  However, these are very old machines by this point, and most of us have something slightly newer.  One myth that needs to be dispelled is that dual-core processors will run Vista better than single-core CPUs: Vista is, for the most part, based on the Microsoft Server 2003 code, which is, in turn, based on the XP code, both of which came before the advent of multi-core processing.  Therefore, to the effect that the operating system is run, there will be only a marginal difference between a single-core or a dual-core CPU, provided both use identical core architectures.  Of course any applications that take advantage of multi-threading will benefit from multiple cores, but this was, is, and will always be the case, independent of the operating system.  The question is simply whether you see yourself multitasking more with Vista.  If that's the case, then a new computer with a dual-core processor installed is probably your best bet; if you're fine with your current setup, then it will most likely run Vista and Aero without any problems.  It is interesting to note, however, that some upgrade aptitude utilities have some small quirks and will give conflicting and non-real results.  For example, such a utility offered by Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) passed both my A64 X2-based machines without a hitch.  However, when on a whim I ran it on my old P4-based desktop, the utility seemed to think that a 2.40B GHz Pentium 4 Northwood (533 FSB) would be insufficient to run Vista.  I smell AMD bias, even though I happen to favor AMD over Intel.  Just take what such utilities tell you with a grain of salt, and remember that Microsoft's own utility is likely the most reliable.  Generally, your processor will not be an issue when upgrading to Vista. ---  --- Hard Drive: ---  --- Again, this one is pretty straightforward.  If you have a 40 GB hard drive or better, you're good to go.  And if you don't have that, hard drives are so cheap these days that you could easily at least triple your current capacity for about what it costs to take the family out to dinner one evening (Amazon does not allow price figures, hence my vagueness regarding pricing throughout this review). ---  --- Things get interesting when you consider a dual boot scenario.  This is when you have two operating systems running on the same system, either on the same or on different hard drives.  In my honest opinion, this is the best way to go because you get to keep your current operating system (just in case you run into problems with Vista), and you also get to have Vista.  Keep in mind that, in order to run Vista on the same hard drive as your current OS, you'll need to install each OS on a separate partition.  You can either purchase a third party partitioning tool, or do what I did, which was use the Ubuntu Linux live boot disc's built-in partitioning utility.  Of course there is risk involved with this last solution (but, in my experience, I've used it dozens of times with no problems), so do the latter only at your own risk. ---  --- -COMPATIBILITY- ---  --- This is where most of the horror stories have come from.  Both hardware and software compatibility nightmares are flitting around in denser clusters than fish flies in June.  Up until recently, anti-virus and anti-spyware programs have been unable to install on Vista.  In addition, many proprietary printer applications are incompatible, yet the printer itself will often times function perfectly.  Graphics and sound card drivers still haven't really caught up, despite the fact that they've had a little over two years to do so.  I won't deny that, if your system just happens to roll the snake eyes, you're in for some hell. ---  --- But it's not half as bad as you hear.  I installed Vista without a hitch; there is a separate part of the process where the OS scans the system for hardware, installs the necessary drivers, and then generates a list of anything that doesn't install properly.  Every piece of hardware I had was recognized.  In addition, my printer was recognized and installed in about five seconds, despite the fact that its own software would not install (and that its maker, HP, still hadn't posted a Vista-compatible version).  Even my USB Internet modem, which the Upgrade Advisor flat out said would not work with Vista, installed and ran perfectly when I supplied the drivers from the manufacturer's website.  The fact is, Vista has shipped with exponentially more drivers than any edition of XP.  Plus, it's possible to supply drivers from manufacturers' websites for the odd, esoteric bit of hardware that isn't immediately detected.  Sometimes it will work, sometimes not.  But this is only to be expected when upgrading to a new OS.  I don't seem to remember everything being rosy when XP came out, either.  This is yet another item of strong support for a dual boot scenario. ---  --- Software is no different from hardware.  All my software titles, with the possible exception of the ancient original Roller Coaster Tycoon, work flawlessly with Vista.  And the latter didn't work with Windows XP MCE 2005, either, so I don't blame Vista for this.  If your software acts buggy or otherwise just won't work, check the manufacturer's website.  If it's a fairly recent title, there will most likely be some compatibility patches or a whole new version of the application, all free of charge.  Just be ready to insert your product key, if required, in the latter case.  Now of course chances are that if you have some pet application from the mid-nineties, it might kick up a few Dickens.  Again, a strong case for dual boot. ---  --- The final and perhaps most prolific source of upgrade hell is, ironically, the upgrade itself.  This process works by performing an in-place upgrade of an already existing operating system (XP).  These sorts of upgrades are notorious for problems, and the Vista crop is no exception.  However, since you're currently viewing the full version page, this obviously isn't an issue for you.  Just remember, the best ways to install Vista are either as a clean installation (if necessary obliterating an existing OS) or a dual boot scenario.  Anything else and you might experience problems.  But this has always been the case with in-place upgrades. ---  --- -OVERALL- ---  --- I thank you for reading this far.  Most people won't.  I know this was pretty long, but I wanted to get it all out there for people to read.  Vista is not a bad operating system.  Was I absolutely floored with it?  It may require some more time, but it hasn't been the revelation Microsoft promised.  This is somewhat disappointing, and yet, somewhat reassuring as well.  I didn't suffer any downtime because I couldn't figure out how the operating system works, I didn't have any glaring compatibility issues, and my computer has worked virtually error-free ever since I first installed the OS. In short, the change, while not mind blowing, wasn't drastic or disturbing, either.  At the end of the day, just remember: It's Windows.  Love it or leave it, it's just Microsoft's operating system.  Vista will do the same thing as XP and earlier editions; it's not a source of inspiration or drive.  It's only as good as the person who's using it.
JS CONCERT WAS THE MOST BORING THING I HAVE EVER SEEN ON DVD! MY CAT WAS MORE INTERESTED IN WATCHING IT THEN I WAS, AND THAT WAS ONLY BECAUSE OF JESSICA'S FRILLY COSTUMES! THE SOUND SYSTEM STANK! I WAS EXPECTING HER VOICE TO ECHO LIKE CRAZY. ALL OF JESSICA'S SONGS WERE ABOUT EXPRESSING HER LOVE FOR NICK. THIS DVD IS SO BORING I'M FALLING ASLEEP JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO SAY ABOUT IT.  OH YEAH...HER VOCALS WERE TOO BREATHY, THAT PINK THING SHE WORE LOOKED LIKE A FLAMINGO CAUGHT IN A SHREDDER, AND SHE SHOULD HAVE LEFT TAKE MY BREATH AWAY ALONE!  NICK DIDN'T TAKE HER BREATH AWAY SHE TOOK HIS WHEN SHE DECIDED TO WALK OUT OF THEIR MARRIAGE! NICK WILL BE SINIGING I'M TAKING HALF AWAY!, AND JESSICA WILL BE SINGING I SHOULD HAVE PRENUP
These are just great for cooling of quickly without a sticky feeling...unable to find them in the stores. 
Excellent cookies-my boys love them & know they are a treat that is on the healthy side. We will buy these again.
Making ancient history entertaining?  For children?!?  You bet....  Enhance your history studies by reading books that are written specifically to a child.  Great book complete with historical accuracy & lively illustrations.  Approximately 3rd grade reading level, interesting to even older elementary students.  Don't rely on it for a primary source, but include it in a study of Greece.  Nice book
This pillow is totally functional and comes in handy when traveling and space is limited. I even use it at home when just watching television.  It creates a natural relaxing position, it is a must have
The color of the product I received is nothing like the picture! If you want Royal Blue then this is the case for you
I bought this at a fossil store for $85, and its worth every cent. It has the time, day of week, date, and military time. Its waterproof up to 100 meters. It has a double lock to stay on your arm. It is glow in the dark. It has a spinning number thing. It looks good and is always shinny. its only 85 bucks. ITS PERFECT!!!!!!!!!!!!!
First of all i'm a die hard UFO fan,i own EVERY UFO album not just the michael shenker cd's...some of you fools reviewing the ufo albums without michael ..1) do the band a disservice 2)are smokin crack, and 3) are very inept in your musical judgement. While i'm a huge shenker fan he is far from the greatest guitar god,and i hate to break the news to ya's but for overall sound/effect and appeal paul chapmans just good as michael on many a song. That bein said MAKING CONTACT is one of the top five UFO albums MADE!!!! the top five UFO albums any fan should get are (PHENOMENON,LIGHTS OUT,NO PLACE TO RUN,MAKING CONTACT,and WALK ON WATER) along with the two live cd's BBC,and strangers in the night. Misdemeaner has some cool 80's guitar and is an attempt at mainstream(and they deserve to be mainstream) so who can blame them,and some of these songs are pretty cool...IF,I might add if you have an open mind (so that excludes most of you shenker diehards)...........
This is an excellent product.  My 7 year old son had ADHD and he is constantly moving.  He has to take medicine to focus at school during the day and moves non-stop from waking up to going to bed at night.  His teacher was happy with his attention at school, but he was still fidgeting a lot.  She gave him this "Wiggle Seat" for his desk and has seen an amazing improvement in his ability to focus and and participate in class.  My son has noticed as well.  He has a hard time sitting at the table when doing his homework at night.  He told me I needed to get him a "Wiggle Seat" for home because it helps him concentrate. ---  --- If you have a child with ADHD and you're looking for alternatives to medication, this is a great product to try.  And they'll get great posture as a bonus! :
Excellent independent research!  Investigative journalism at its best.  It is neither a liberal nor a conservative publication, for neither Republicans nor Democrats are spared.  Politicians make a lot of claims, and Mother Jones looks beyond their words to see if they actually put them into action.  As you will see when you read Mother Jones, many politicians (both Democrats and Republicans) do not "put their money where their mouth is." Also, ignore the reviews saying that it is biased.  Apparently, they consider facts that are inconvenient and run counter to their beliefs to be biased.  What is interesting is that if they came across an article in Mother Jones that supported their beliefs, that they agreed with, then they would probably say that the article was impartial and fair.  Hey, the truth hurts sometimes.   Finally, the reviewers claiming that this is a liberal magazine    --- because it talks about Bush so often are misguided.  Mother Jones does so many articles on Bush because he makes so many claims and says so many things that are not supported by his actions.  He is an easy target.  They do articles on Kerry and others too.  
I bought this product in the color Paparazzi from Sephora - online, I read wonderful reviews about it in the magazines.  I was very disappointed when I finally got it and tried it. There is way too much glitter in it for anyone over 13.  I could not wear this to work or even an evening out as I would feel like a clown.  The only place this would look semi-good at would be a nightclub where it is dark. I was hoping for more of a shimmer than pure glitter.  I do not recommend this product at all. I also returned this promptly back to Sephora.     
My daughter got this for Christmas this year and almost immediately pulled off the top half of the Greg character on the keyboard.  In their defense, none of the other characters have come off so we will try to return this in case it was an isolated incident.  Other than that, she seems to like it.  She also received the accordian and LOVES it so I would recommend that over the keyboard
i love these shoes and wear them at least 4 days a week
This is J.A. Jance at her worst and the readers simpering narrations doesn't help
The sound is low, static-ky, and it frequently dropped calls. Boo.
I hate it when rock stars form those g0d awful "supergroups".  Can't people see that putting a whole bunch of different people from different bands together in one band is just a marketing scam and nothing more?  There's no such thing as a good supergroup.  The Supergroup is the only kind of band that deliberately tries to $uck. ---  --- When Damn Yankees released their 1990 debut, every song on it was so incredibly generic, there was no hope for this band.  The whole album seemed rushed and thrown together.  They had nothing meaningful to say with these songs, it just seemed like they were pumping out filler and hoping somebody would be stupid enough to fall for their "supergroup" scam.  The big, booming, arena rock choruses just ring hollow.  I guess they're trying to be catchy and have memorable hooks, but to me, it just sounds like a lot of filler. ---  --- Supergroups will always suck, because they diliberately try to sound bad!  Thats right people!  Supergroup members know that since they're already popular, the album they're putting out is guaranteed to be a big seller----"Why bother trying to come up with good songs?  We're already popular, so people will buy it no matter how bad it is! Lets just put out filler."  Supergroups are a TOTAL farce, its just easy money for the people involved, and nothing more.  If you buy ANY album by ANY supergroup, than you my friend, are a sucker! ---  --- If you want to hear Shaw or Blades at their best, just keep listening to any Styx or Night Ranger album, and avoid anything by Damn Yankees, or any other supergroup
The Schumann that is presented here is a forgery. Don't get me wrong. I'm not railing against Schumann at all. The question here is what makes Schumann great, and the way that Bernstein presents these symphonies says Schumann is great for the wrong reasons. The real Schumann that lived was a completely different person than what we might assume from listening to this particular presentation of his music. Schumann was not a hopeless romantic. He was one composer in a long line of "classicists" which ended with Brahms, yet at the same time he was an innovator, pushing forward, trying to find new stylistic and technical means of expression. He had plenty of dignity, and he didn't write his music as a desperate plea for the world to like him, which is exactly what it sounds like here. Bernstein trudges through these fine works as if he were dying. Yes, many of these performances are the slowest on record, but this is a BAD thing. These beautiful works lose value immeasurably when they are saturated with thick, waxy, overly romantic textures and phrasing. Tell me, did Schumann ever write: "To be played extremely histrionically and melodramatically, with the greatest possible amount of cheese and theatrics" in his score? No! HE DID NOT. These performances are not more expressive than others in the real sense of the word, and any person in his/her right mind should be able to see this. You may be able to hear the orchestration more clearly than in Karajan's filth, but that's not saying much at all. And for this slight favor Bernstein does for the music, he makes it infinitely worse when he stretches the fabric of these works beyond their limit. The most blatant example is the third movement of the second symphony, taken at half tempo. All semblance of melody and motion is lost. This movement is supposed to be several minutes shorter than the first, and not the longest movement of the symphony, not to mention the longest movement in the entire set. In fact, almost every movement of every symphony could stand to have at least a minute hacked off of its timing. Also, while looking at the scores, you might notice that Bernstein does away with detail work this time around. Carefully laid out phrasing and the dynamic arch are thrown out of the window in favor of grand "romantic" gestures. Observing details in Schumann, ironically, helps to make the music speak more freely and honestly. This isn't honest music-making here, only a self-indulgent conductor once again plastering his image over the face of great art
Modern dub stylings from an assortment of recording artists, ranging from the bizarre and brilliant (check The Lost Scrolls of Hamarik's darkly deranged How To Find Royal Jelly), to the utterly unforgiveable (namely, Luciano's appaling attempt at Police & Thieves). Luckily for us, most of the tunes here fall into or around the former category, with great contributions from St. Germain (bouncing dub-disco on A Dub Experience), Grant Phabao (updated roots righteousness on Andub Head Yudu) and Boozoo Bajou (with the wonderfully cheesey Divers). And let's not overlook Cottonbelly's 90's classic Tempest Dub, which resurrects an old Scientist tune to spine-tingling effect. Only the fairly plain Seven Dub and the aforementioned Luciano really fail to ignite...All in all then, a worthwhile collection which works very nicely as a whole - providing you program the CD player to skip the occassional duffer
I used to have a hard time getting my kids to eat fruit until we tried the Just Tomatoes products. Now I have a hard time getting them not to eat the whole tub in one sitting. To have a picky eater eat all the fruits from this company is amazing to me. I love them too, great for a quick low calorie healthy snack
I have to say, growing up my marshmallow Cream always came out of a jar, so half way through the jar you'd have to put your hand inside and get it all sticky.  Now with this tub with a wide mouth, my hands aren't sticky.  PLUS because it has no carbs or sugar, I can eat more straight then I ever could... without having to worry as much either
This monitor worked pretty well for 4 months. We purchased this monitor and it worked well provided we were in the next room or on the same floor as the receiver. However, when we were downstairs (baby's room upstairs next to our's) the monitor was fuzzy, and had static and lines running thru. We were still able to have audio recpetion. After 4 months, the picture disappeared, audio was still operational. Not a good camera for long term
Atomic watches are highly-accurate quartz watches which are synchronized each day with a time signal broadcast from the definitive U.S. Atomic Clock in Ft. Collins, Colorado. Thus, all atomic watches are always accurate to within a fraction of a second at any time. Since atomic watches adjust automaticaly to and from daylight saving time they are the ultimate in accurate watches. Casio makes -- and Amazon sells -- a wide selection of styles of atomic watches to suit various needs and tastes, but all are equally accurate. The Casio G-Shock series is especially rugged and the solar powered models, such as this, never require battery replacement. Atomic accurary, solar power, and G-Shock ruggedness is an appealing combination at a quite reasonable price
A delicious, nutritious cereal that rebounds energy at breakfast or for a quick snack.  Very vegan and very good
I would recommend The Power of Simplicity to everyone.  This book goes far beyond a discussion of marketing strategy.  The idea of simplicity is relevent to all aspects of life.  This book is full of useful information and contraversial suggestions pertaining to marketing strategy.  Although the book is considered an educational read, I feel that it is extremily entertaining as well.  It's just an interesting book, it doesnt get much simpler than that
its a nice necklace for your mom. no matter the age im sure she'll appreciate it. i was not quite sure what to expect but i was unexpectedly surprised that  it is really pretty and lustrous. i guarantee that you will be pleased and your mom will love it
You will see for your self why I like this magazine when you bought it & did you see her big ass
These truffles are very, very sweet and very, very rich.  The powdered sugar forms a thin, crisp shell around a thick layer of creamy white chocolate which is filled by a dark chocolate/champagne ganache.  I don't hesitate to offer them to friends because nobody eats more than one or two at a time.  They're just that rich.   ---  --- I recommend them for a totally luxurious experience, especially if you are giving small gift boxes w/ only a few chocolates.  I don't recommend for people who prefer their chocolate less sweet.  Actually, they are a bit too sweet for me, but I gave five stars because the product description warned me and they're still really good.  People who have a bigger sweet tooth than mine probably won't share. ---  --- The packaging is a gold box, wrapped in blue and white Leonidas paper with a gilt deep purple box.  For shipping, the package was placed inside a sturdy styrofoam shell.  Mine arrived within three days and looked like I'd purchased it at the store to give as a gift
I played this at a friend's party, and it was a wretched party game. It basically consists of a person reading the puzzle in a monotone voice and allowing everyone else to attempt to figure it out. It is incredibly monotonous, and a throughly awful game to play at a party. ---  --- I admire its cleverness. It took a lot of creativity and know-how to make up these challenging puzzles. But for the sake of all your guests, I emplore you: Hide this boring game. Hide it as well as possible. ---  --- The painful thing is that out of a choice between Mad Gab and Lost: The Game my friend chose Mad Gab. It's sad, really
 --- I was a little wary about the title but this was not at all about weight gain and/or loss; weight was incidental. In this fiercely intelligent novel, Dorothy and Justine are both desperately lonely women, both victims of abuse, and yet are different in other ways. Their parents often failed them, their childhood was often full of shame and self-sabotage, but Gaitskill writes this with complexity, always aware that a victim can also be a victimizer. Gaitskill is never sentimental. Underneath her narrative, underneath the pain and the sex scenes (which are never fully loving) and the disappointments and loneliness, is a raging anger at the inability of human beings to connect - on race, on class, but mostly on gender. I sensed that Anna Granite, the intellectual whose shadow dominates this narrative, and who is the reason Dorothy and Justine first meet, is Gaitskill's platform for displaying her keen intellect; and sometimes there is a hint of didactism. But this is a minor quibble. The last section moved me very much and proved that although Gaitskill abhors sentimentality, she can certainly do sentiment well. `Humanity' is a word often found in this book. Our sexuality is connected to our humanity. Our ability to treat other human beings like human beings is what makes us human. In the end, Gaitskill's brilliant, wonderfully feminist novel was, for me, about how easily we strip each other of our humanity.
Can't say enough good things about this Brother all-in-one, given its price and features.  (I paid $100 more than the new Amazon price elsewhere a week ago.) ---  --- I installed as a network device and set up the software on my XP Pro as well as Mac OS 10.4.9 machines ... easy installation, and the interface on each OS is essentially the same.  Super fast prints from either machine, crisp and beautiful, with tonal background fills printing which never showed up on my previous HP laser. ---  --- Duplex scan/fax as well as duplex print was the key to my purchase, and I've been really happy.  What I did not anticipate was just how fast the printer is, or how rich the delivered software is compared with prior HP experience. ---  --- Noises don't seem unusual to me - no crackling here, just noisy paper handling by ADF and print engine.  No big deal IMHO. ---  --- Only a few minor negatives I've seen so far:  (1) it looks like the firmware can only be updated from a Windows computer, so Mac folks are stuck there (mine was delivered with current version of firmware, so maybe this doesn't matter), (2) you cannot feed heavy stock through it, even the manual feed tray - so need to keep a straight feed device around if you need thicker than 24# stock, (3) scanner transfer rate to computer is a bit slow - not sure if it is the network interface or a slow processor in the device, and (4) expansion memory is not a popular size, so is more expensive than current PC memory - not sure if I'll upgrade or not. ---  --- Haven't tried envelopes yet, so can't respond to earlier comments from others. ---  --- It's kind of entertaining to watch the machine do a duplex copy - as pages in the ADF suck in and out to scan both sides, and pages ejecting come partway out and suck back in to copy the back side
This is a very nice watch.  It is smaller than it looks in the picture, but I actually like it better that way--it is delicate and lady-like.  The pink face is subdued and the steel band is polished.  It makes a nice dressy or everyday watch.  I have seen similar Seikos in the stores for much more money. 
The product description calls the Orangettes "Belgian Vitamin C."  Except for the luxury price, I'm sure Belgians must be pretty healthy with these around.  They're amazing!  The combination of orange peel and chocolate has long been popular, but Leonidas does it very well.  The dark chocolate is very rich, not bitter, and completely covers the orange peel (which retains a good flavor and isn't overly sweet).  Unlike other chocolatiers who often dip the peel only partially, Leonidas has made certain to put their chocolate center stage by using a generous portion.  The result is an addictive treat because the flavors linger on the palate and the Orangettes aren't so sweet as to become cloying. ---  --- I don't know if these guys are really going to improve your health, but they will definitely improve your day.  In my opinion, they're worth the money as an occasional purchase and certainly worth a one-time try.   ---  --- The packaging is a gold box, wrapped in blue and white Leonidas paper with a gilt deep purple box.  For shipping, the package was placed inside a sturdy styrofoam shell.  Mine arrived within three days and looked like I'd purchased them at the store to give as a gift
Flipping through the pages of Writer's Digest at a local bookstore, I found some of its content to be particularly useful and interesting, especially those on the trade of writing that could benefit the novice writer. So I decided to subscribe to the magazine and it was only then that I realise that problems do persist in this seemmingly wholesome and helpful magazine.  ---  --- Since I have subscribed online directly through WD's website in Jan 2005, I have received only a few issues. In the first few months for almost half a year, I received no issues at all. It was only later then when I e-mailed them did they manage to get some issues through to me. The annoying thing is that even though I have e-mailed WD a few times on this problem, they would reply apologetically saying that they will extend my subsription. How does this tackle the root of the problem? If they could not have assured its overseas subscribers a consistent service, they should not have offered an 'overseas subscribers' option. Ironically, I received their letter asking for a renewal of my subscription recently with my home address clearly printed on the front of the letter. ---  --- Logistic problems aside, the magazine does have its plus points. In the issues, there are useful tips for writers not simply on the craft of writing, but also on the business and spiritual aspect of the writing process as well. Occasional issues also features insights into the lives of authors to give us an idea of how and where they work, their opinions on life and the areas from which they derive their inspiration. All this from a range of authors from a range of genres. Essentially, the business of writing is also not left out. ---  --- However, the magazine is not one fraught without problems. The problem with WD is that the information presented to readers is too limited and scattered. Each article though containing valuable tips on writing, does not have enough depth to really improve the work of authors if they are really implemented. In addition, because of its range, it also does not provide what some writers really want consistently, which can be a waste of time for them to read if they are subscribers. Sometimes, it does seem that the magazine is purposely limiting the information that they give to readers in order to encourage further buying of future issues. This for example, can be seen in the amount of publishers' addresses that they offer. At most, each specific article on a particular topic contains on average 7-10 addresses. There is nothing wrong with this, but why would an author want to waste his time to have bits and pieces of such information when he can just purchase a Writer's market collection of publishers(and agencies) addresses collected into one? And ironically again, the same company does publish a 'Writer's Market' collection which is of excellent quality annually. ---  --- That said, the same problem - the lack of information and depth, is also seen in the advice and tips it gives as well. To make matters worse, every issue is usually cluttered with a plethora of advertisements that can be frustrating to readers at times. Writers want to organise their time and information, not add on to it.  ---  --- If you want are thinking of subscribing to WD, do consider the alternatives that are currently available. Writing is a craft that requires more common sense and acumen than many would like to think. However, if you are not particularly concerned with little information fed to you in slower dozes or are not too worried about a little more untidiness in your life, than this magazine might be for you. But do your research first
  This book is packed full of incredible devices for any one who enjoys Exalted. The book has a wealth of knolage from the first age as well as the age of sorrows.  ---  ---      The book has a few sections in it that divide the items by uses, that is the only way i can discribe it. There is a giant amount of artifacts that have nothing to do with combat, and then others that are. There is a section on warstriders, basicly single man "death machines" that basicly look like Large Metal Robots.  ---  ---      Most of the items in this volume are very well detailed and all have pictures that show you what they would more that likely look like. I don't like saying that IS what they look like because, well, this is RPing people, things change by a player/GM's perception.  ---  ---       Anyway, enough of my ramblings, This book rocks and has items that range from pens to armor to boots to Royal Class Warstriders. This book is about gear in the world of Exalted. ---  ---   P.S. It looks like there is going to be about 4 more of these books. My best guess is that one will be for Sorcery, but that is just one book. If you think of anything else, post it here to give me some ideas on the other ones
ah... ---  --- um... ---  --- well, my brother picked this up not too long ago, and , well... --- it sucks! it's the WORST of the whole series! --- i thought it would have to do with the mask Michael wears in the others, but not a FICKEN THING!!!!!!!!!!!! ---  --- I gave it two stars because i liked the killing scene in the hospital, but then i took one because of how bad the rest was..
Download takes awhile, but the picture quality was great, even full screen. It played all the way through. And, to boot, it's an excellent show
This was not fun at all boring and she only played with it one time Definately a waste of mone
Synopsis (including Ending): --- Don Ameche (Gino), a Chicago shoe shine man, is approached by the mafia to go to  --- jail for "3 to 5 years" to take the place of their Mafia boss accused of murder because  --- he bears a striking resemblance to him.  They'll pay him yearly and satisfy his lifelong  --- dream of fishing on a boat.   Joe Mantegna (Jerry) takes Don Ameche (Gino) on a 3 day  --- vacation to satisfy his every wish before he's incarcerated.  Joe Mantegna is on probation  --- from the Mob, after disobeying orders from a previous job.  Joe Mantegna goes   --- "outside channels" to take Don Ameche (Gino) to Lake Tahoe to the "Galaxy" Hotel  --- where they stay, wine and dine, and try to have a good time.  Things turn difficult  --- when a local real Mafia Boss brings Don Ameche (Gino) to his house as a guest and  --- they form a bond.  The real Mafia Boss has a gathering of crime bosses planned and  --- Don Ameche and Joe Mantegna are caught in the middle.  They escape the gathering  --- and on the day Don Ameche is brought back to Chicago, Joe Mantegna is ordered --- to kill Don Ameche and make it look like a suicide.  "It's cleaner this way...", he's told. --- Joe Mantegna refuses the order, and the film ends with a Mafia employee testifying --- in court and getting sentenced to jail for 20 years to life. ---  --- The Good: --- Joe Mantegna is an underrated actor generally and it was nice to see a familiar face in --- the real Mafia Boss in Lake Tahoe.  Other than that, there's nothing else going for --- this one except a slightly funny scene with the concierge. ---  --- The Bad: --- The Mob wants tough guys, right?  This is a comedy, right?   --- No ones a tough guy and there's no laughs. ---  --- Joe Mantegna plays a sissy instead of a Mafia tough guy.   --- Don Ameche plays a senile acting senior with no personality.   ---  --- I wanted to like this film but I coulden't because it was very slow, very boring --- and none of the characters were interesting.    ---  --- We never have a scene with the real Mafia Boss that looks like Don Amecha  --- and the two never meet.  You would expect a friendly "Thanks for going to jail  --- for 3 to 5 years for me" but it doesn't happen. ---  --- At the end someone for the Mob is dressed up like the real Mafia Boss and he's --- testifying in court and gets sentenced to jail.  He doesn't look anything like Don --- Ameche or the real Mafia Boss and yet, he's right there taking the fall. --- If the film didn't need to depend on Don Ameche's appearance, why didn't --- they send him to jail from the beginning?   ---  --- The worst David Mamet experience I've had.  Very surprising stinker. ---  --- The Characters: --- If Don Ameche played a less passive character he would have been more interesting. --- If Joe Mantegna showed more conflict as a character with reasons behind them, --- he would have been more interesting.  As the film stands, they're both flat. ---  --- Don Ameche had no personality and his only lines are the ones other characters --- used.  When a character says something, you can be sure Don Ameche repeats it --- 30 minutes later like a senile robot.  Don Ameche's dialogue leaves a lot to be desired.   --- Add to that his boring and stale acting in this film. ---   --- He played very dumb, not interesting, like a real man in crisis about to go to --- jail for money. ---  --- Overall, Joe Mantegna was not believable as a Mafia hired hand.    --- Don Ameche was too passive and uninteresting, and Joe Mantegna is too  --- passive and stale. ---  --- Scene Criticism: --- A couple scenes stand out as being very weak and unrealistic. ---  --- (Gas Station scene where Joe Mantegna is given $3 more in gas than he asked for) --- Joe Mantegna is working for the mob, and he asks for $1 of gas,  --- and gets $4.  He doesn't have the cash to pay, and when the gas --- attendant takes the car keys his reaction is "Please, please, please" --- A real Mob guy would punch the gas attendant, take back the keys, --- and leave for the plane they were late for.  A mob guy that won't  --- defend himself for $3? ---  --- (Scene with Don Ameche offered money to go to jail for 3 to 5 years) --- Don Ameche doesn't put up a fight or try to leave the room, and is  --- too passive.  We don't learn about his past or his life or family.   --- There's not enough time spent on the offer, and the scene was --- over valued for it's lasting value. ---  --- (Bedroom scene with Joe Mantegna trying to let Don Ameche escape) --- Joe Mantegna had no real connection to Don Ameche's character --- to justify the scene.  Instead it's 2 strangers. ---   ---   ---  --- Personal Commentary: --- The test for a comedy for me is - "how many times did I laugh?" --- This film never made me laugh.  I'm shocked the film costs $24.99  --- on DVD.  Rent it instead.  It belongs in the $1 bin at Wal-mart. ---  --- Writing Criticism: --- Lines like "He's the guy behind the guy behind the guy behind the  --- guy" and lines like "A big man knows the value of a small coin" --- and the story about the grasshopper and the ant make no sense. --- The writing is drivel. ---  --- Alternative Recommended Film:  "Trading Places" with Dan Aykroyd and Eddie Murphy and also --- Don Ameche, albeit in a smaller role
The item is great quality and will last for a long time. Does exactly what I intended it to do
I ordered enough Stevia packets to last me for 1 year. Most of the packets have the sugar hardened.  Every so often I am finding one that is powder as it should be. The others must have gotten some kind of moisture to them because they are hard.  I will never buy Stevia from the company I purchased from again.  I don't have the receipt or I would have returned them asking for a refund. I have been upset about the way they came.
If you want to star in a movie about stopping your own death, play this game.  It is as if you are the star of the film.  But that also means that there are many cut-scenes.  These cut-scenes are very well done with great graphics, excellent music, and very dramtic.  But there are those of you out there that don't liek cut-scenes at all.  If this is the case for you reader, don't buy this game.   ---  --- If you do love movies, and enjoy watching cut-scenes, you can't go wrong with this game. ---  --- I have played the entire game and let me tell you, it is a steal at any price.  It is that good...if you like cut-scenes
My husband and I like to buy Newman's products. We love their cookies so we thought our dogs might like them, too. So we got these dog treats and the LOVE them. They're even shaped like hearts! They come with 6 bags so they'll last a while but they're packaged so they won't go stale

This book is a very good resource for parents of underachievers, former underachievers, and anyone who wants to understand the success of their child. Having read other reviews by readers discounting this book and discounting human psychology itself, I was compelled to write my own review. No one blames parents, especially Dr. Rathvon they do the best they can with what they've got; mental resources specifically. This book is for anyone who knows that their child is capable of so much more. It is never too late to fix, polish, and fine tune a learning mind. Every student has the ability to achieve
We originally bought this game at the Chiricahua National Monument in Arizona for our kids (8 and 10 years old at the time) and they loved it.  We love that it's Monopoly, but one that creates interest in visiting our national parks. 
I love this cleanser!!! I have combination skin and I sometimes have breakouts, especially when I am stressed. This cleanser is great because it sloughs off the dead skin without irritation. I also love how it doesnt dry out my skin! And I have a lot less breakouts now, and when I do, its not as bad as it used to be. Even if you have sensitive skin, this cleanser is perfect, of course there are other great cleanser options if you think this will irritate your skin. Also, this cleanser really helps to minimize/clean out your pores. I really noticed a difference after using it for only a week. --- I also recommend the Perfecting Lotion especially if you have slightly oily skin. I use it during the day and even at night(!)because it really improves my skin and I dont wake up with zits in the morning :)Plus, It saves me money since i dont have to by an acne treatment gel to put under my lotion
My Cousin recommended for me to watch this movie.  It will keep you on the edge of your set, like it did me.  This is one movie that you don't wanna miss, go out an buy or rent this
The new Systemworks has a horrible interface.  You can't see what your options are easily.  You can't see the status of your components.  You can't see what version you have.  When you load it after loading Norton Personal Firewall 2006, the Firewall will not load program rules (you have to uninstall the Firewall and then reinstall it).  I'm not sure how the protection works, but the software "redesign" was done by an ergonomic moron
I've been a fan of Dave's sauces for quite awhile now and this product is no exception.  The initial bite into one of these olives is relatively painless.  And then the fun begins.  A slow burning sensation begins to take over until your mouth is wondering, "what did I just do?".  Want some more fun?  Offer some to friends and then stand back to watch the excitement.  While not as heat intensive as his Insanity Sauces, ranking only half-way up his thermometer scale, it's still got a little bit of punch to it with it's five different peppers.  Who would've though olives could be this much fun
 I think this is the best book that I have ever read. I thought that the Civil War was very, very boring but when our class started to read Bull Run I knew that I was wrong. The way that Paul Fleischman writes he would leave you wanting to read more. From the way Paul Fleischman described the characters to the words that Paul Flesichman use to set the tone of the characters he just seem to draw a cool picture of what is going on in your minds eye. Each character has a different story of the war and of life. I would suggest this book to anyone who is learning about the Civil War. It supplies you with a lot of information you might not get in  the history book and tells it in a way that makes you want to learn. This book was excellent from the first page I read. Even though this novel is very brilliant, some people might not like it. If they can not wait to know what happens to a favorite character, like one of my favorite characters Dietrick Herz. He had the funniest voice I ever heard. When Paul Fleischman leaves you hanging he really leaves you hanging. But the only way to find out the ending is to read the entire book and find out what happens for yourself. And trust me it will be worth your while this truly is a magnificent book. The best that I have ever read and if I liked it then for surely you will love it too, trust me. Before I read Bull Run I had only read books with one or two characters and this type of book was really, really new to me. I had to get use to it a little but since it wasn't very hard to read it only took a short time to adjust to the Bull Run story by Paul Fleischman. Some of the characters that I really liked was Toby Boyce because he had a good attitude on trying to learn how to use the fife. Another was Carlotta King because she had a very spunky voice in this story like how the Yankees would get rid the of the law so that the slaves could be free and be in control of there own religion and what I mean by that is they can practice there own religion. Another one of my favorite characters is Vergil Peavy. I think that he was my favorite character because of the way he sounds in the story. In the story he sounds like he's from Texas also the way how he talks about the war like they were the big war heroes. And my last favorite character is Shem Suggs because he was the lonly one who likes to talk about horses and to horses also what they are like who they should be with. Shem Suggs is the person who takes care of all the horses, that he watches pretty much like baby sitting the horses. But the reason I really really like him is because he minds his own business and doesn't talk to people about the war and the politics all he talks to are his friends which are the horces. That is the reason why I like Shem Suggs the best out of all the other characters the best because he is smart
Amazon grocery was fast and easy as usual and the mac & cheese is great, we can't get our five year old to stop eating it...price wise its a fairly good deal in comparison to the grocery store..
We were so excited about getting this fire pit & rightly so... it's great & we couldn't ask for more! Adding wood is a breeze, it radiates heat well, was very easy to put together & so far hasn't shown any rust at all (although we do expect it to eventually)..
I was a little surprised at the size and weight of this watch, its almost 0.5in thick, and the bezel is a full 1.5in across so the case is a bit bigger than that.  The mineral glass crystal seems substantial and durable, but the clarity is just average.  In addition to having glow-in-the-dark markings (which don't work too well) on the hands and dial-markers, it also has an Indiglo style back-light (which does work well).  The bezel only rotates counter-clockwise, and it seems very tight at first.  Overall, it's a decent everyday watch. 
Did not fit into the handle bar on my recently purchased bike. It should have listed the minimum inside diameter of the handle bars it would accommodate
Her voice takes my breath away, I fell in love with her. --- I highly reccomend it
I subscribed to Details because I'm interested in the male psyche. I also like looking at the male celebrity pictures and the guy models on ads. Its not the most politically correct article on the planet, for one the last page is called "gay or...?" In which the writer tries to uncover if a certain type of person is gay or not, and no conclusion is actually ever given so I suppose its for the reader to decide.  ---  --- Its a very stereotypical part of the magazine, but beyond that there are cool articles to read from male perspectives. I also enjoy reading the celebrity interviews, in addition they include interviews with female celebrities. I don't agree with everything that is printed here, but certain articles have made me think and I've actually gotten a lot out of it. It helps me understand guys and I do agree with certain opinions. The mag leans toward the liberal and is unabashed in its attitude to do so. I like it a lot, it may  not be for everyone and that's fine.
I've heard this book on tape, which, poor writing aside, is more horrifying to actually hear O'Reilly read in his own voice. The gratuitous sex (which can only be appreciated if you also enjoy harrassing others with phone sex and falafels) is enough to turn anyone off, but THAT VOICE narrating the suggestive scenes is waaaay too much to endure. A sad, sad example of narcissism at it's very worst
Honestly, Led Zeppelin is the ONLY artist that can create monumental album after monumental album and have not ONE bad song.  When you listen to one of their albums in your car, there's no, "Oh, I really like track 2, but I don't like the next couple, so I'll skip to track 5 after that one's over."  Now it is common opinion that the classic albums of Led Zeppelin are the first five, and "Houses of the Holy" is the fifth one.  This is Zeppelin at their pinnacle, which in my opinion, they never fall from. ---  --- "The Song Remains the Same" is Pagey at his best with his Gibson double-neck.  The song itself makes you want to ride the wind because it is so airy, but at the same time a fast-paced rock tune.  Page's initial (and INCREDIBLE) guitar solo makes this song the perfect initial song on this album. --- "The Rain Song" is a lovelorn masterpiece with the lovely sounds of an orchestra to help create this mood.  The lyrics are deep, and while the song to me is melancholy, it is also refreshing. --- "Over the Hills and Far Away" is a 5-trillion star song, with amazing acoustic and electric guitars with mystic lyrics. --- "The Crunge" is groovy and funny.  The bass is really felt in this song, and odd spoken lyrics at the end give a laugh. --- "Dancing Days" is very far out, but a summer-y song with an addictive riff. --- "D'yer Mak'er" is one to definitely highlight Bonzo's masterful rhythm skills, or in other words, GREAT DRUMS!  Equal to that is Pagey on guitar and Robert's singing, "I still love you so...but I can't let you go..." --- "No Quarter" is the quiet masterpiece that is credited to John Paul for an exquisite keyboard solo. --- "The Ocean" is quite the upbeat song on this album with a raunchy riff.  An overall energizing song. ---  --- This is the best deal for this album--do not pass it up!  I hope this will be a permanent fixture to your collection...not one bad song
"Rip It Off" is not an easy film to watch. In short, it is dull and meanders from plot line to plot line, leaving only the most attentive viewer (read: myself) to guess at what was going to happen next. But not in a good way. Judging from its drab look and unimaginatively shot scenes, not to mention a script whose dialogue borders on the absurd, it never ceases to amaze me how it managed to attract such well-known and talented personalities as Alyson Hannigan and Jennifer Esposito. It begs the question: WHY DID YOU DO THIS FILM? Or, on a personal note, why did I BUY this film, especially at $22 and change? Frankly, I bought it because of Alyson Hannigan: she's gorgeous, obviously intelligent, and the girl can act. Individually speaking, she does not disappoint here. It's obvious that she really didn't want to sleep walk through her role as Lexi, and she gives the other actors a lot of material to work with. Although the silly musical leitmotifs seem deliberately crafted to undermine her scenes, she is a singularly interesting actor to watch, and her performance simply wants me to see her do more, preferably a more mature and fully fleshed out character in a serious film (see Jennifer Aniston in her brave performance in "The Good Girl.")But enough gushing: if Ms. Hannigan had not been as engaged, I would have trashed her soundly. Most everyone else in "Rip It Off" (with the possible exception of the fellow who plays Sergei with operatic relish) is more or less "phoning it in" when they do their scenes. This made me lack any kind of sympathy for them in addition to making me sleepy. Also, films of such low production value should come with a printed warning of some sort: BEWARE! DO NOT ADJUST YOUR SCREEN; THE APPEARANCE OF THE FILM IS INHERENTLY BAD. "Rip It Off" and films of its ilk give independent filmmaking a black eye. I've seen black and white student films with greater intrigue and atmosphere than this turkey. And, contrary to the technical description of the DVD, IT IS PRESENTED IN THE HORROR THAT IS FULL SCREEN, AND NOT WIDESCREEN. Can you believe people invest money in these films? (Ahem.
Jimi Hendrix was an ideal guitarist to lead a power trio, and he thrived in that format.  He inspired other groups to attempt it, with varying degrees of success.  But the Experience was a unit, able to soar on stage in extended live versions of Hendrix's compositions. Had it not been for the demon of discontent within the trio itself (that curses so many otherwise excellent bands), the Experience might have created several more inspired albums than it did before falling apart.     ---  --- The album BAND OF GYPSYS was jarring upon its release to those of us looking for Hendrix to continue to maximize the potential of the Experience.  At the time, loosely associated groups that traded off lengthy lead parts in a more or less generic old-style blues format were common and certainly not original -- much less cutting edge.   ---  --- It's true that Jimi does some respectable work on this record against the backdrop of the blues grooves supplied for him, but there's an odd and unwelcome shift in the balance.  Buddy Miles became a kind of intrusion into the world Jimi had fashioned in his previous work.  On a Hendrix album, songs sung by Buddy Miles didn't move the bar; they did not elucidate Jimi's universe.  Buddy's drum work was simply not in the style of Mitch Mitchell, and that was a large step down from the Experience's innovative grooves in songs like "Fire," for example.  Listen to "Fire," and then listen to any cut on "Band of Gypsys."  Listen to Hendrix's wild half-sung, half-wailed vocals on the previous albums, and then listen to Buddy Miles sing "Changes."   ---  --- You can't reconcile the two styles, and that would not be quite so bad if it weren't for the obvious fact that Band of Gypsys, under Buddy Miles' unfortunate influence, were not a step backward toward traditional blues rather than another reach into the future already painted by Jimi's previous work in tracks like "Are You Experienced?" and "Third Stone from the Sun."  Jimi's guitar work put him several steps ahead of the blues in terms of making his instrument perform overdriven rock tone poems and distorted rock concertos on his behalf.   ---  --- Band of Gypsys turned Jimi backward into a lead player in a blues band, which one might even have mistaken as being headed up by sideman Buddy Miles. That's not what people bought a Hendrix album for.   ---  --- It just didn't work very well as a release from what people still considered the Hendrix Experience.  Jimi seemed to have gone off track somehow, and the effect was to make him seem a little less what he had been up to that point.   ---  --- No doubt people got smoked up and enjoyed portions of the album that seemed like an intimate studio groove, but the cohesion of the Experience, the clear creative identity of the Hendrix Experience was not there.  You can say it was as simple as the fact that we missed Noel Redding and Mitch Mitchell, and that may be true.  But whatever the line-up, people were not entirely ready for Jimi to share his stage with any other would-be featured players. 
This extension cable did not work with my standard Microsoft S Controller.  Unless you still use the old monster-sized XBox controller, these cables are worthless
Look...to be fair, one man's BOTE is another man's "Manos". What I mean by that is some people may love this ep, but I personally didn't find it very funny and the movie is so bad that the sub-average riffing doesn't save it. The best lines that Mike & the robots make are when they speak for a character and add a line to something a person says. Unfortunately, the feature's horrible pacing, slow dialogue scenes, and atrocious acting are not enough, and it seems like the writers took a break on this one. Of course, even weak MST3K is better than pretty much any other show, but I must say this is certainly my least favorite episode from season 5 and at times feels like a Season 1 episode (the riffing is sparse and not really funny). If you are a newcomer and would like to see this show at it's best, get either "Manos: Hands of Fate" or "Red Zone Cuba"
If you are a guy that loves some sexy women of your dreams, COP THIS MAGAZINE. You might even want to get a 2 year subscription. This magazine is full of of sex full figured queens and you can almost bet that the cover girl will always make your heart beat faster and make your mouth water. LONG LIVE THE KING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It only takes a little bit of reading to realize that abrading the skin with a piece of metal is NOT the solution for ending blackheads/enlarged pores. Using this "extractor" is equal to using one's fingers to squeeze out imperfections, which may produce very temporary results, but is ultimately fruitless. Those who feel a need to purchase this device should invest in professional deep-cleaning instead, which will rid the skin of excess oil and help the pores to close without aggravation
I just bought this the other day having owned the regular sized Kabuki brush.  I find I like the Baby Buki better, it still gives great coverage just in a more compact size which I love
This magazine is ideal reading for anyone who demands a broad perspective and deep analysis about any current topics related to international foreign policy. Years ago, I subscribed to the magazine and now, as an International Relations grad student, I use articles in The National Interest to address my areas of concentration. The pieces are useful to me because they are so in-depth. I appreciate the pragmatic approach of the writers as well as the wealth of information the editors ensure are featured in each issue. I particularly like the Reporter-at-Large feature and the recent "Conversation with Henry Kissinger" segment.  ---  --- Top-level experts on foreign policy like diplomats and intelligence officers, well-known policy-makers, and prestigious journalists make The National Interest an exciting read. The broad and varied views enhance my studies. I like the magazine because the centrist perspectives distinguish this magazine from the many others I read like The Economist, Foreign Affairs and Foreign Policy. I find that every article offers level-headed reasoning; no sound bites, no bumper-sticker clichï¿½s. The articles offer conclusions that allow me to develop my own informed opinions.  ---  --- For anyone who wants to be up to date about foreign policy, and who wants to develop well-documented opinions from those who have been on the "front lines" of world affairs, this is the magazine I recommend without reservation. ---  --- 2nd year Graduate Student at the Yale University, McMillan Center of International Studies.
these are the by far best gummy bears.  more fruity flavored than artificial.  i get these any time i go to europe, they are all over germany.  i recommend them to anyone who loves the gummy variety of candy
I enjoy watching this movie over and over again with my family and friends.  Best purchase I ever made
A MUST READ!!  THIS MAGAZINE GIVES YOU THE MOST UP TO DATE INFORMATION ON THE POWERLIFTING CIRCUIT. GIVES GREAT LIFTING AND FITNESS TIPS TO BOOT!!! THIS MAGAZINE SHOULD HAVE MAIN STREAM PUBLICATION AND DISTRIBUTION
I have yet to receive my first issue of Cat Fancy.......who do I contact to correct this problem??
This review is for Nike T-90 Club Team (32 panels) ---  --- I bought this ball for less than $15 thinking I couldn't go wrong. I hadn't used Nike balls before, so I didn't know what to expect. It turns out that this ball flies better, is softer, is rounder, and is better stitched than my more expensive adidas balls. Great practice ball, and pick-up game ball. I would have no problem using it in a small club match either. As far as my $30 adidas balls? Not a chance. ---  --- 5 Stars based on performance vs. price. I hope you get as good a deal as I did (through Eastbay Athletics)
I have watched this film on my local PBS station at least 1/2 dozen times because it is soooooo good. I have a mental vacation each time. I find that my stress just goes away while watching this awe inspiring movie. I HIGHLY recommend this film for the whole family
   I can honestly say that when I first heard Scarling's "So Long, Scarecrow", I was less than impressed. I've been into Scarling for a few years now, and when I heard their first record,"Sweet Heart Dealer", I instantly fell in love. I somewhat held it above everything else, I was so impressed by it. So when I heard the progression from SHD to SLS, I was a little bit let down. ---  ---    But after three solid listens, from first to last, I was totally amazed by this record. It was like something clicked and I was able to see the beauty each track held. I seriously listen to this CD almost everyday. Although I prefer some tracks to others [(Northbound on) Cauhenga!], I really can't think of one track that I just don't like. It now takes place in my favorites over SHD. ---  ---   I feel that this record can really appeal to anyone; it's very versatile. And, as always, Jessicka's beautiful vocals compliment the indescribable amazingness of the music wonderfully. If you're indecisive about purchasing this record, I say bite the bullet, give it a few solid listens, and promptly be blown away
Great value and excellent quality.  Better than anything that I've seen locally.  Highly recommend
I HAVE NEVER BEEN INTO FULL RIM HATS. I NEEDED ONE FOR THE WORK AND REST I DO SO I GAMBLED ON THIS. I AM VERY HAPPY THAT I DID. IT FITS PERFECTLY, AND ALREADY I HAVE BEEN THROUGH A TWENTY DEGREE DIFFERENCE WITH RAIN, AND BEING A GLASSES WEARER, I CAN SAY I AM DEFINITELY PLEASED. I RECOMMEND THIS HAT FOR ANYONE LOOKING FOR THIS TYPE OF PRODUCT FOR ANY REASON
I was offered  one of these while cycling and thought it was very tasty.  So good, in fact, that when I got home I went straight to the web site show on the back of the wrapper to learn where I could buy them.  Just above the web address is the nutrition and ingredients list.  That was probably a mistake on the manufacturer's part as it gives you something to read while the site comes up.  OOPS!  This bar has a whooping 25% of your daily allowance of saturated fat!  Not only that, but the fat is palm oil. ---  --- This might be acceptable for a soldier involved in prolonged strenuous activity but I doubt a cardiologist would recomend it to most of us.  A commercially formulated product is more likely to fill the average person's need for a lower fat (and healthier fat) energy bar, than one formulated for extreme physical activity, sold for profit and marketed as a patriotic tribute to the troops.  Bottom line: Read the label, weigh the health risks and if you want to support the troops, there has to be a better way than eating Hooah Bars. --- 
In many languages around the world, "chai" simply means "tea." In India, however, the word denotes a specialty that to tea lovers even in the West is fast becoming what cappuccino already is to coffee lovers: spiced milk tea.  ---  --- Chai comes in a variety of recipes that differ from region to region, although traditionally it consists of a blend of black tea, rich milk, various spices and a sweetner. The spices most commonly used are cardamom, cinnamon, ginger, cloves and pepper; Tazo's very peppery Chai adds rooibos, vanilla, star anise and chicory to the traditional recipe.  ---  --- You should always have this tea with real sugar, even if you have all your regular tea without any kind of sweetener, because only sugar will bring out the full flavor of the spices. And if you like your store-bought Chai, maybe you'll one day try brewing chai from fresh black tea and spices, too! Namaste ..
I have been using Norton Anti-Virus since I purchased the Compaq Presario 4000. The reason I have stuck with Norton because this Presario came with Norton Internet Security 2002 attached to it. I never used the NIS 2002, though, but I purchased the Norton Anti-Virus (NAV) 2003 which I have bee using for the last three years. In fact I used the NAV 2004 for two straight years without any response from Symantec, then all of a sudden that subscription was eventually retired by Symantec. I liked the NAV 2005 (which Symantec six months prior to its due date subscription, which made me mad and hence my wanting to try NIS at a subsidized rate) because like NAV 2003, it could tell if someone or something was trying to intrude into your computer. It is after purchasing and trying NIS 2005, that I realized how low and base Norton can go with its software. First when I tried NIS 2005, it blocked all my websites. I couldnt access them and I could not read my e-mail (Whenever I tried to read my e-mail, the response would be that, that action has been cancelled). So I reformatted my hard drive and the NIS 2005 appeared to be working quite well until I tred to install Adobe Reader 7.08 and couldn't allow me to proceed. Moreover, it was snail slow in allowing me to read one mail to another. So I uninstalled NIS 2005 and installed NAV 2006, which appears to be working well. I have now purchased Tend Micro PC-cillin 2006 as well as McAfee Viruscan 2006 at subsidized rates, should Symantec pematurely terminate my NAV 2006 prematurely i.e. before the 366 days of subscription are over. I think one of the reasons why NIS could not work is that it is a program that it is trying to do more than it can chew. It tried to be an anti-virus, personal firewall, privacy control, antispam as well as parental control in one. It reminds of the days when it was better to purchase a cassette player separate from  the radio, since the technology at that time could not produce a good combined raio cassette player. I think Norton Internet Security is in that mode. It is not yet competent to produce a combined solution that is both antivirus and anti spam,anti-spyware at the same time. Hence the many complaints of its being a buggy program. At this stage, I would stay away from any program that calls itself "Internet Security." I may try Trend Micro internet Security which has received rave reviews from a couple of its users, but that will be if something goes wrong with my current NAV 2006. Otherwise, I am still wary of those programs that pass off as "Internet Security" such as "Norton Internet Security" or "Trend Micro Internet Security," pending their perfection of this technology at some future date
This little girl lives by herself, Its wild how she lives, and what out for that white powder! Mario is her only friend. --- And trap door is a goner
Good quality product at very reasonable price. Postage was quick even though I'm in the UK. All round good service
I bought this over the Sony and I regret it.  I get a tape eject error every time I try to rewind.  I can only rewind at 10 second intervals before I get an error message to eject the tape and do the same thing over again.  That's a long time to rewind a 60 minute tape.  Many Canon users are having this problem and the only way they address the problem which is clearly a mechanical problem is to charge a ridiculous price to send it off to be repaired.  Canon needs to own up to this problem and have a recall on the item.  I will never buy Canon again after they have turned a blind eye to a serious problem
*** Spoiler Warning - this review might reveal surprises in the movie *** ---  --- First off for a frame of reference, I'm a 30-year old male and a sucker for Disney movies in general. ---  --- When this movie came and went to the theatres in a flash, I heard so much bad about it, how it was the worst Disney movie ever, that I actually didn't go see it in the theatre. I regret that now. First time I actually saw this movie was on a 14-hour flight from Los Angeles to London, and I fell heads over heels in love with it! ---  --- I adored the original Novel "Treasure Island", and I believe that Treasure Planet lives up to it. The central theme of Treasure Planet, in my mind, is the boy, Jim, who grows up with only a vague recollection of his father who in the movie appears like a shadow in Jim's faded childhood memories. ---  --- I think this particular "flashback" scene was very powerful, it featured the absolutely brilliant "I'm still here" track by Johnny Rzesnik, and led the viewer to fully understand Jim's childhood, and to share his teenage frustration and delinquency that stems from his father abandoning the young Jim and his mother. Possibly, I might a bit biased in this respect, since I can strongly identify with this situation as my own father was "married to the sea" when I grew up, and i can admit that i blubbered like a baby during the flashback sequence. ---  --- This is right in line with the core message of the film. A young, reckless and frustrated boy who is taken under the wing of the Old Salt, who becomes his new father figure. He learns how to take orders, work hard, grow, face adversity, and eventually become a man by making tough choices. An excellent message in this day and age, if you ask me. ---  --- I also loved the theme the producers chose. A type of anachronistic retro-futuristic design, where we in the future still use old, creaking, wooden, pirate ships, but with ultra futuristic systems. The movie also suspends the viewer from reality in many flavorful ways - for instance when the spaceship travels through the universe, it encounters a pod of whales. Or how Jim takes a dhingy "comet surfing". ---  --- I think this film provides excellent entertainment, suspense and has a great message for kids. But as an adult, I think I also got a kick out of this GREAT and CLEARLY UNDERRATED Disney flick. ---  --- SEE IT
The worst thing for this is, you have to bring a bench of disc with you and replace disc every 20 min if you are capturing HD video. I think most of buyers would take HD video if you buy a HD camcorder. But a small disc can only hold 20 min HD video, have to change disc time by time. The CMOS sensor is worse than CCD but it is the best sensor among CMOS in this price today. A lot of noise will come in low light condition! I bought it for $800 and return it. I think you'd better buy SR1 with a 30G hard drive. That would be a much better one!
I am so disappointed by another Avent product that is just no good.  Short term or long term these cups are not worth anything since they leak.  My son's cups have leaked on him, on the floor, in his diaper bag and in the car. I don't understand why anyone if they say they have leaked would give this product anything but 1 star.   Mom's have enough too do---running around cleaning after leaky, unreliable products is not fun especially for the price of the Avent Magic Cup.  
I bought this heating pad about a month ago and it did not get near as hot as I would like! It is so hard to find a good heating pad now, but I would NOT reccomend this one
I was anxious to use this for my mother as she has a bad back.  However, immediately after opening the product, I tried to plug it in, as it doesn't work without batteries being fully charged.  Unfortunately, this massager would plug in but did not start charging, and therefore, it could not be charged. ---  --- I will be returning this item
This is a great show and very entertaining.  The story isn't the Greek classic, but it's a fine riff on it.  The songs are good, and they grow on you as you watch.  I take issue with the reviewer who thought there was gratuitous sexuality in the Meg character - it's just a cartoon, for pete's sake. ---  --- Like some other reviewers, I was also annoyed with Michael Bolton singing "Go The Distance" over the end credits, but this DVD has a music video of the Spanish language version, "No Importa La Distancia," sung by Ricky Martin, and it is killer!  This one is well worth the money
I bought this stroller and attempted to use it but one of the wheels kept going flat every morning. I had to order another inner tube. Then on the third day of trying to use this stroller, the front wheel completely bent. What a piece of garbage. I only had one child in the stroller and the wheel was fastened correctly and all I was doing was trying to push the stroller up a small curb. The other thing I didn't like about this stroller is that there is nowhere to hang/put a diaper bag. I sent this stroller back and bought a MacLaren double stroller
First of all, they look cheaper than I thought they would look.  But the most important thing is that they are very uncomfortable across the TOP of my foot.  In other words, the straps at the top rub against the top of my foot, and caused blisters.  I am hoping that if I keep trying to wear them, the "leather" will soften up and become easier to wear
The oatmeal tastes okay but the purchaser should be aware that this IS NOT an instant version of McCann's Irish Steel Cut Oatmeal, the oatmeal it is famous for.  I thought McCann's only sold steel cut oatmeal but it also apparently sells the regular type of instant oatmeal that is flavored.  I would not buy this again since the steel cut oatmeal is what I prefer and is much better for you
I was very pleased when I got this cell phone case. I was really frustrated with my phone before purchasing this case. I kept on getting the screens dirty every time I made a call. Guess I have oily ears or something. No worries now that I have this case. ---  --- The things I like about this case: --- 1.I think it looks cool -- which ... ok does mean something to me. --- 2.It feels good - it has kind of a rubber feel and the inside is cloth --- 3. It protects my phone - I have two boys and while they are supposed to not touch "dads phone" it has an almost 100% chance of getting dropped sooner or later.  --- 4. Its not bulky. --- 5. Fits the phone 95% perfect. ---  --- The things I don't like: --- 1.Like the other guy mentioned the clear plastic covers the camera a little but not a big deal, camera is not so hot anyhow. --- 2. Earphone spot is awkward. Functional but not perfect. ---  --- So the GOOD far far outwieghs the bad.  I have no buyers remorse and after surveying the options for the v710 I still think this is the best
Other than the Republic of Tea The People's Green Tea, I really like Yogi Tea Healing Formula. Not only is it 80% organic but the refreshing subtle taste of lemon grass with powerful antioxidant ingredient like grapeseed extract (protect cells from free radical damage and also promotes healthy circulation) should make one incorporate tea drinking in one's daily life. Other health benefits of green tea are for symptoms like headaches, body aches and pains, digestion, depression, immune enhancement, detoxification, as an energizer, and to prolong life. The only side effect is insomnia and I'm suffering from it but I know my immune system is thanking me for 6 cups of green tea each day!
This movie is truly wonderfully done.  I appreciate the lightheartedness of the characters, and the deep resonances of director Zhang Yimou's commentary on academics in modern rural China.  The language is particularly good for students learning Mandarin Chinese, as it shows an excellent example of the differences between spoken Chinese in the countryside and in the cities.  There are English subtitles for beginners as well.  I highly recommend it. 
 ---      As we've heard, it's not easy being green.  It's more than easy, it's delightful if you're an Avobath Bath Ballistic.  Infused with avocado (hence the name) and olive oil it moisturizes skin. ---  ---      The fragrance is fresh,  rather citrusy, thanks to lemongrass and rosewood.  Bath water is a lovely shade of green, rather like new spring grass. ---  ---       If there's glitter in it I didn't find any, which was as I wished.  It's suggested for morning - I'd relax with an Avobath any time of day
Ditto to all the positive comments on the previous posts. However, I have not had the problems with the bands like the many have mentioned. I've had two of these watches now, going on third as the battery has died on number 2, and I have never had an issue with the bands on my first two. I wear mine all day, every day, even in the pool or shower, and it's held up well. The light did go out seemingly "too soon" but then I notice the battery was beginning to fade as well at the same time. I wear mine all day, every day, in pool and shower, and it's held up remarkably well. The only negative is that it seems the battery goes quickly ... but maybe that's due to using the alarm daily and training with it.  ---  --- It is an inexpensive watch (compared to many other options that are out there) and given its ease of use, its very readable face, and sleek look, I'd take the chance on it
I thought I would love this but just returned it.  It hurt my neck so badly after only wearing it a short time (10 minutes?)  Maybe I'm too small (5'2")or my baby (5 months and 18 pounds) is too large.  Either way I still find the Bjorn much more comfortable.  I would like something where the baby is more sideways on my hip like this than either facing me or facing out and so confined as he is in the Bjorn, but I couldn't stand wearing!  Very painful
I'm using it for a few months now; I haven't found a single problem so far. Earlier, I was using an old FinePix and the optic/sensor sensitivity was not very good; poor quality of photos taken in dark environment. This is not a problem any more. Also, I was impressed with the sharpness of photos of sport actions taken with 10x zoom. In general, I was pretty enthusiastic about all the features of this camera; it took me nearly 3 days to try everything out :-). Sure, there are better cameras on the market; however, considering the price it is just a great deal
Most of the world still runs on PCs and as a Mac owner (and lover), it can be tough to find software for basic stuff like accounting.  I'm a guy who makes a living making stuff sound good for radio, TV, video games and so on.  As a freelancer, I need something to keep track of my business banking, credit cards, expenses and invoices and this program does just that and very intuitively, just like my Mac.  --- I used MYOB--a Mac accounting program--but found it to be tricky and didn't end up with the comprehensive reports for my accountant that I expected and wound up going over everything expense by expense and invoice by invoice for hours.  It could be that I didn't understand the program well enough, but support is extra everytime you call customer service for help, so no thanks MYOB.  In fact, I put off doing most of my 2006 accounting until January 2007 because I dreaded trying to figure out MYOB again.   --- Then I broke down and bought Quickbooks for Mac.  It did everything I needed it to--a year's worth of accounting in a weekend and I never even cracked the manual.  It allowed me to save the year as a PC file to hand to my accountant on a CD.  A few days later he handed me back a CD with a Mac file of my adjusted accounting and my corp taxes were done and sent.   --- I can't speak for anyone with really advanced accounting needs because I never got that deep into the program, but for my needs it's right on the money.   
As much as I like most of the songs on this CD...it's just too short. Also the production is lousy.  The recording quality sounds awful in places. Hopefully, the updated compilations are better. This one is not worth the money!!!
I bought this recharger kit specifically for a Sandisk m230 mp3 player.  When I first received the kit, I charged all of the batteries.  Upon first use I only got 7min. out of each battery, when I got 20 hrs. from the batter sent with the player.  I learned online that the batteries still have their charge, but due to the battery's "memory effect" or "voltage depression," my player thinks the batteries have lost their charge after only 7min.   ---  --- If you are buying batteries for an electronic device that detects how much "juice" is left in a battery, do not buy this kit
Great magazine couldn't recommend it any higher for anyone starting out with macs. iCreate also introduced a great Pro section in 2005 to delveinto the workings of ProApps such as Final Cut Pro, Photoshop, mDVD Studio Pro etc. Now here's the thing, I'm wondering how the magazine can be available for subscription while the magazine was put on hold late last year. Me, or anyone I know with a subscription haven't recieved the mag for months, and there has been no contact from the people who handle the  subscription despite zillions of e-mails. So be careful, get the full story before you hand over any money!!!!!!!!!!!  check the web for similar storries, you will find the
This horn set is a good deal at the Amazon price, and with no sales tax and free shipping, it is about $8 cheaper than the local auto store. I purchased this as the second replacement for a Toyota 4Runner. The compressors tend to rust since they are exposed to water kicked up from roads. This compressor looks better sealed, so that might make it last longer. Most Japanese cars come with weak horns, and this set makes up for them. They tend to scare the unwary (a good thing). The installation is straight-forward, but does require connecting electrical wires and mounting the relay, compressor and horns. To keep it simple, I tapped off the existing horn wire, ran a ground wire to an existing screw and used existing holes in the body panels
This Jack in the Box is pretty flimsy.  Not worth the price. Would have returned it but it would have not been worth the expense.
Table toppers are an awesome product. We don't leave the house without them. It gives our daughter a clean area to eat and helps the waithelp.... there is no mess when we leave because it is contained on the Table Topper. We just wrap it up after her meal and toss the whole thing. The different designs also entertain our daughter while waiting for our food. Other people, not only parents, ask about the Table Toppers and comment about them because it is such a convenient and easy to use product
This CD is not at all what it appears to be. They got other people singing and playing the music, so it's not what you're probably looking for. Terrible misrespresentation. I was so disappointed! Thank goodness I used my other party cd's or my guests would have left......and I would have held the door open.....not blamed them for leaving!
Shouldn't Amazon address this in some way? If it is real I would buy it; if it is fake (and the previous poster certainly seems right on that score) shouldn't this be off Amazon's site? I think it becomes an issue of Amazon's credibility..
This was my first cologne purchase.  It's a really delicious scent -- complex and pleasant, not overpowering.  Give it 15 min to dry and mix with your skin.  It truly does smell different from the first spray.  I can't stop smelling myself...I really love the smell. ---  --- My only complaint (and it's a biggy) is that it doesn't last for more than a few hours.  After two or three hours it's completely gone except for a slight trace when I press my nose to my skin.  I've tried spraying it on my body (neck, wrists) and also my clothing, and it just doesn't last.  I feel the need to carry the bottle with me and reapply it every few hours, but that's not going to realistically happen.  It's really disappointing, since it's so delicious
What's not to like? Light, compact and comes with the strap, case and wipe cloth.  They are perfect.  Keep in mind 12 power can be more challeging to hold still
I was impressed by the value and quality of this book.... Outstanding!!!! ---  --- It is all his plays and poems in one place with a nice look and feel to the book (for the price) you can't beat it. --- 
Maiden had evolved into a new metal standard in 1986. Not only did they lead the metal world with the greatest artwork on covers, but their music took a new form and justifed everything they had done in the past. Iron Maiden to Powerslave were just the stepping stones to this standard classic.  ---  The CD Starts out with CAUGHT SOMEWHERE IN TIME, a galloping bassline, and parallel guitar make it, not only a classic, but ahead of its time. The rest of the CD id in pure form. My favorite track, however, is ALEXANDER THE GREAT. The intro starts out with a whisper of that era, and slowly builds to the howl of, I feel, the battle cry of the great warrior of History.  ---  Iron Maiden did not dissapoint with this CD. It is very well mixed and produced, and remains a standard in my collection of CD's.
Although it KILLS me to write anything less than glowing about Edwin McCain (I think he's probably the most talented singer/songwriter we've seen in the last ten years), I just can NOT get into this album. ---  --- Like others have said, I too have every Edwin album and have seen him in concert. I love everything he's ever done.... but this album just doesn't do it for me. And I know people will say... "Give the album a chance"..... or... "Let Edwin grow and move in new musical directions". BUT..... I've listened to this album at least 10 times all the way through and it's just not growing on me. It feels "flat" and just doesn't feel EDWIN-ISH (if that makes any sense). Even Grammercy Park Hotel, which I saw him debut live and which is on his live DVD doesn't feel the same on here.... just doesn't have the feeling or soul.  ---  --- I would pick up Austin Sessions over this album any day. THAT is Edwin doing what he does best. Maybe he feels the pressure to write some "hits" so that he doesn't have to spend two solid years on the road in the Black Pearl (his tour bus)..... and who could blame him??? But this feels like he's trying too hard. ---  --- I SOOOOOO hope he comes back with a better album next time, so I can rave about it, because although I gave this album 2 stars.... Edwin, as a person/singer/performer/songwriter deserves 10!!!!!!
Not a great deal of new insight here. I did learn a bit more than I knew, however, about Meade's failure to pursue at Gettysburg. Mr. Boritt is the editor and author of one essay; other essays are by four historians: Stephen W. Sears, Mark E. Neely, Jr., Michael Fellman, and John Y. Simon. (Alan J. Jacob
So really, how important is this fruit, err vegetable, err fruit?  I mean, I like salsa, and a hamburger just would not be the same without catsup, err ketchup.  Come to think of it, spaghetti would not be the same either.  But eating these things plain is just silly.  The taste is not so bad, but the consistency is all messed up. ---  --- In conclusion, if you must have some tomato in your diet, please purchase tomato related products and not the tomato itself.  And why the heck isn't it spelled "tomatoe"?  Why is the "e" added for the plural form?  What gives
Having avoided seeing this film, I found that the mistake of sending my partner to the rental store on his on, brought "Tuesday..."unbiden into our home.My aversion to Oprah and her ilk, does not cloud my dislike of this film. A bad film is a bad film.Devoid of any real plot and hampered by some very poor acting on the part of all concerned, and directionless directing, this film should not be seen by anyone who values the aforementioned,To me a reasonable premise should move a story forward. Something should occur, my interest should be engaged. This film takes reams of pre-packaged aphorisms and greeting card verses, and attempts to build the plot from words alone. It is as if someone picked up the telephone book and said, "Hey,this book is full of words, lets make a movie."In a way a movie about the different lives of those listed in the telephone book would be more interesting.To be honest, Jack Lemmon was not very good in this film. He played the same character he always did. Just older. Hank Azaria was just awful. He talked as if his mouth was filled with stones, and was wooden and expressionless. Maybe he was too embarrased to be there. As to the other actor's; well they filled up the space nicely.The look of the film was cheap and of the movie of the week quality. The sprayed on snow in a winter scene looked as fake as it was. They even covered the green leaves on the trees. Some better acting, some good R rated dialogue, and maybe some nudity would have spiced up this film. As it stands,however, it will only be of interest to fans of Oprah and Dr.Phil, etc. The purveyors of our national state of pity and feeling soory for ourselves.It is seldom that we find car keys under our chairs, but films such as this perpetuate the myth that a few nice phrases, a good cry, and a genial talk-show presenter will somehow make it all better.I,for one, think that a nice cuppa is more beneficial. Then pull the finger out, and just get on with it.(To the grammar and form police: I did have this in paragraphs, but the editing process scrunched it all together. Sorry
of all the other Caswell-Massey scents I've tried, some are kind of old fashioned smelling.  High quality soaps in luxurious packaging.  Not as long lasting as some other triple milled soaps I've tried
The book jacket for "The Ruins" offers a can't-miss premise:  a group of post-grad American tourists at play in Mexico jump at the chance for a little adventure among Mayan ruins but find but then find themselves in unimaginable danger.  It's the stuff of great Summer thrillers ready to be taken to the beach.  But 319 pages later, the reader is left to wonder whether or not the publisher put the wrong book in the jacket.   ---  --- Almost immediately, you'll notice that Smith's writing is as dense as the jungles that make the setting.  However, despite the endless stream of words, his descriptions are often threadbare.  Plus, there are no chapter breaks, which eventually pushes the pace until it feels like an assignment to continue.   ---  --- Next, the characters themselves begin to fall flat.  There are only really two couples to keep track of, and yet it's difficult for the first third of the book to distinguish them.  There is little to keep you interested in what they're doing or why they might be doing it.  Smith's attempts at developing these four as characters come in fits and spurts.  This seems obviously haphazard and hurried - the author is jamming in backstory whenever needed to explain characters' actions as if he were patching leaks in a dam.  By the end of the book, the foursome seems to be as disinterested in each other as the reader is in them.   ---  --- And for the readers who are hoping to discover something of interest in the setting such as Mayan mythology or archeological lore, forget it.  Aside from language barriers with the locals, there is no reason why this fantastical story couldn't have been set in the wilds of the Rocky Mountains, the Saharan desert, or anywhere else.  The danger posed has nothing to do with Mexico, archeology or mythology at all.   ---  --- Ah yes, the danger posed.  Well, I can't say much at all because anyone could give away the entire book with one line of explanation - that's how thin the plot is.  The numerous other reviews that fault this as a short story masquerading as a novel are exactly right.  Suffice it to say that when you do realize what the danger is (and you'll realize it well before any of the well-educated characters do), it's a real eye-roller, as if to say "I read this many pages for THIS?". ---  --- By the time the story concludes, it's more irritating than suspenseful.  The characters take so long to blithely undertake any course of action at all that you'll start rooting against them.  Eventually scenes of gore start piling up in an obvious and lazy attempt to interject some action, but even aside from being misdirected, it's too little too late.   ---  --- This book could have been an adventure, a supernatural thriller, a survival tale, or a horror screenplay.  It could have even taken the high road as an examination on people's reactions to situations of extreme stress:  some take the lead, even enjoying the challenge, while others whither into a shell of hopelessness.  But none of the possibilities ever come to fruition in this disappointing effort. 
Bits of Beatles,Zappa, Queen, (Herman's Hermits ?), may be laudable  in intent but reveals the crucial difference between an original musical mind and a talented imitator. Elfman's themes are good but his songs have some of the same faults as your normal Musical pieces, they have fairly banal, repetitive lyrics and are cut and paste music. Has the creepy competence of a Dave Grusin album. If you like that you'll be OK here
My sister (who reviewed the MST bags) turned me on to this tea in January. ---  --- I was a chai girl up to that point, a cup in the morning.  I could generally take it or leave it. ---  --- Now no day is complete without my beloved MST.  I began with bags, which are amazing.  I upped it to loose tea pound bags and have become a total tea person.  I do believe I will branch out this time and order some rooibos and green versions--may as well make the shipping charge worth the time. ---  --- I can't say enough about this sweet, spicy stuff.  It needs nothing but one enormous cup because a little one just won't do.  Prepare to become addicted.  Oh, and I've lost a lot of weight, too, because I no longer drink coffee with creamers and truly have no sweet cravings anymore.  If that doesn't justify buying it by the pound, nothing will!  Enjoy this amazing brew!  And share it with a friend
I love Anakin Skywalk
My daughter likes it because it uses the same format her high school teachers use.  Also, she likes the research tools that it provides.  And, it's easy to use.  It's very practical--she uses it a lot
I really like the fit and function of this Cingular 8125 case. All the holes are in the correct location and the belt clip is comfortable (no sharp edges to irritate). I ordered 2 other cases elsewhere that did not fit properly and I sent them back. This one is a keeper
First off: I'd like it better if we had 1/2-star options. Judas Unchained really doesn't deserve a 2, more a 2-1/2 or 2-3/4. ---  --- I have a love/hate relationship with Peter Hamilton's books. He's very adept at introducing interesting technology and making a faster-than-light society plausible but, as with a lot of these hard-science, libertarian SF authors, he badly needs an editor. I was skipping over multiple pages of irrelevance in both this book and its prequel, Pandora's Star. He also has far too many "main characters" who (despite 800+ pages) never seem to come alive. They all speak with essentially the same voice. And when he tries to individualize someone they come off as badly stereotyped '60s era hippies -- come on, does anyone seriously say "dude" in the real world much less the imagined future of the 24th century? ---  --- And why is Hamilton so obsessed with sex with young (or rejuvenated) women? ---  --- Hamilton's treatment of virtual immortality is hit and miss at best. On the one hand, the innate conservatism of an immortal civilization is well developed, represented and believable. On the other hand, the dynamics of the relationship between "old timers" and "first lifers" is unsatisfactory. In four centuries, for example, NO ONE has even attempted to unseat Nigel Sheldon from his position as head of the Sheldon dynasty? Perhaps the Commonwealth's continual expansion is the safety valve but even here, the government (controlled the eternal heads of these dynasties) controls it. Another point that is brought up briefly is why would anyone want to live forever if their life didn't change -- I mean the characters of a novel (almost by definition) are dynamic, go-get-'em types but most people just plod through their lives and then die. Why would anyone want to do that for lifetime after lifetime? ---  --- The aliens are OK. The problem with them (and this is true of nearly every SF story) is that they tend to be one dimensional -- they're all of a singular type and all too often they really do just act like human beings with weird make up. (This is a problem in fantasy stories, too.) On the plus side, I do tip my hat to Hamilton for not allowing the humans to save themselves with an alien "deus ex machina." Ozzie's adventures in "Wonderland" (i.e., the silfen paths) do bring him to the adult silfen and he does find out the origins of the Dyson barriers but the knowledge doesn't really help anyone defeat the Primes. ---  --- Overall, if you started with Pandora's Star, you probably should finish the journey with Judas Unchained. If you haven't started down this "silfen path," I recommend Alistair Reynolds, Tony Daniel or Iain Banks. They write similarly grand space opera but are better at it than Hamilton has proven himself to be to date
This CD is a classic, a must for all those who loved the movie. I wondered if I would get a crackling type of sound, but it is as crystal clear as the movie sound. This is perfect for those who want to practice the songs for a "sound of music" event or a singing class!
It worked great just like i excpected. Everything is still working well i am very happy with my purchase
If you're looking for a game that teaches you some life skills or some morals/ethics, this is not the game for you. If you're looking for a game where you get to blow all sorts of stuff up and wreck havoc and mayhem, you've come to the right place. ---  --- Some of the challenges in the game are nearly impossible. Which is fine because then you can just drive around the city and cause chaos. Cheats make the game much more fun since it gives you weaponry you would otherwise not be able to get (for instance, a tank).  ---  --- This game is great for when a person needs to relieve some stress and wants a forum to take out their frustrations, without fear of legal consequences. But this game is definitely not for kids. Killing innocent people, carjacking vehicles, beating up prostitues for money and murdering cops is material that is totally inappropriate for children. But for adults looking for non-wholesome fun, this is it! My only complaint about the game are some of the glitches (walking through walls, getting stuck in walls, etc.)
Myths are important, but they should not be labeled history.  1.  George Washington was not a great guerilla leader; he commanded conventional forces who fought in lines--just like the redcoats. Washington thought militia and irregulars were undisciplined and unable to face regular troops. --- 2.  Ronald Reagan did not begin the nuclear "disarming" of the Soviet Union.  Eisenhower and Kennedy tried, but (LBJ?) Nixon and Carter were able to bring the ABM treaty, the SALT treaties and he START treaties to a point where both sides began cutting back their nuclear arsenals.  Reagan did have success with theater wrapons in Europe, but the "big nukes" that could end civilization were already being cut back. ---  --- This is an interesting book about Reagan and Peggy Noonan, but some of the history cited is WRONG
Having had every new gadget imaginable I must report that I LOVE this phone because I can take pictures and make videos! I LOATHE having to charge the battery everyday! Perhaps I just got a bad battery but I've NEVER had to charge any phone daily. Keep in mind that I leave my phone on 24/7. Maybe I should turn it off. Does anyone else have this same syndrome?  ---  --- If you're a shutterbug like me, you will love this phone. I didn't even mention the hot pink/magenta color which all gals love.  ---  --- One note of caution, If you live in hurricane alley like me, you may want to carry a spare battery just in case they don't take down the cell phone towers before the storm. It may be useless locally but you can at least tell your people you're still among the living and need money to escape the carnage
I bought the Avent Breastshells because of my sore nipples, and a way to collect leaking milk while I was not nursing, and relieve some engorment. ---  --- 1. It is very messy when removing the colleting cap --- 2. My nipples are still sore --- 3. And the only way to relieve engorment pain is to nurse or to pump ---  --- If I would have known about these factors I would not have purchased this product
I ordered this magazine without really knowing anything about it.  I was very disappointed.  Not enough recipes.  The recipes that are included are not really ones that I would use. 
This is a great camera.  Plenty of resolution. Excellent shot speed.  Sturdy frame.  The kit lense doesn't do the camera justice.  Buy the body separate and add a better lense. ---  --- On the bad side, I had a small glitch with the camera's firmware soon after purchase and had to return it for a fix.  It was two months before the camera was returned.  Sorry, Canon...  you lose a star for that
While the history is cool, the extent to which everyone drinks the Kool-Aid and gobbles it up is a bit startling to me.  I suppose that those people who still care enough about the physical writing experience of pen to paper might be more inclined to romanticize it (in other words, not only great notebooks, see below, but also smart marketing, and more power to them). I also enjoy writing, but with respect to the little 3.5" x 5" books, on a purely practical level, I like these simply because there are very few notebooks out there that provide such a high quality writing experience in such a small volume of space. The little (3.5" x 5") softcover is almost ideal for shoving in your back pocket and carrying everywhere, with  nice, high quality paper. The covers are durable and smooth enough to still work well even after acquiring some "character" in your back pocket (ie they actually mold to your [...] a bit!).  I haven't tried a fountain pen in it; although I enjoy writing with them, I wouldn't use one in this application anyway. These little books are not really for writing the Great American Novel (or the Great Novel of Your Country of Origin), they're more for jotting notes or to-do lists, and they work extremely well in this role. The only reason I withhold one star is the lack of a feature that would make them completely perfect for me; a pen attachment/enclosure provision. My ideal book would be able to accomodate a thin pen in the spine, so that the book could be slid into my pocket easily with no fear of snagging or worry about whether I remembered to "click" the pen to retract it.  I realize this would make it a bit bulkier, though. As it is, my leading pen choices for this are the Fisher Space pen or the Zebra G-301 medium point gel retractable, the former being very, very short (but a bit thicker) when capped, and the latter being very nice and skinny, but longer.  Anyway, these notebooks are a pleasure to use, and though a bit costly, for how long they last me and the pleasure (and utter utility) I get from using them, they seem like a "reasonable extravagance" to me. I'll go through many, many of these before I spend what I would on the cheapest PDA
There are moments in this inconsequential 2005 comedy when I can see a bright future for Jennifer Aniston's light comedic talents, even though this movie does not stretch her much beyond her likeably insecure "Friends" persona. She plays Sarah Huttinger, a likeably insecure New York Times obituary writer going home to Pasadena to attend her younger sister Annie's wedding. Sarah is picture-pretty, 33 and engaged to a nice, unflappable guy named Jeff who accompanies her. At the same time, she's unhappy about her career and wondering why she always feels out-of-sorts with her well-to-do family. A ray of light comes from her only kindred spirit in the family, her feisty, tart-tongued grandmother Katherine, who tells Sarah about her late mother's pre-wedding tryst in Mexico that gives rise to questions about Sarah's paternity. ---  --- All the domestic shenanigans that ensue would probably be enough to fill this comedy's blessedly brief 96-minute running time, but screenwriter Ted Griffin hangs it all on the idea that Sarah's family may have been the inspiration for the Robinsons in Charles Webb's 1963 novel, "The Graduate", which of course, is the basis of Mike Nichols' classic 1967 movie. The tie-in must have sounded like a creative idea on paper, but something happened on the way to the screen that has taken most of the comic invention out of it. In fact, there is a pervasive lethargy throughout this movie, and director Rob Reiner is unable to overcome it because Sarah's dilemma of choosing between adventure and predictability never feels that emotionally resonant. The dialogue never feels sharp, perceptive or funny enough to pull off the inevitable comparisons with the earlier film. Moreover, the story is set rather arbitrarily in 1997 to make the timelines make sense with the stars' ages. ---  --- Beyond Aniston, a strong cast has been set adrift. Playing Katherine like an even more embittered variation on Aurora Greenway, Shirley MacLaine crackles with aplomb as the possible inspiration for Mrs. Robinson, even when her lines are not as snappy as she thinks they are. As the aging but still magnetic Benjamin Braddock doppelganger, a high-tech mogul named Beau Burroughs, an overly sedate Kevin Costner barely registers in a smallish role. When he does, there is an insinuating, almost creepy quality in the way Beau's relationship with Sarah evolves. Until the end, Mark Ruffalo has little to do as Jeff but wait patiently for Sarah to resolve her personal dilemma. Richard Jenkins and Mena Suvari have even less time to make an impression in the underwritten roles of Sarah's passive father and bubbly sister, respectively. The 2006 DVD provides the original theatrical trailer (which gives away most of the plot) as its sole extra
Product is hard to review because you sent me the wrong battery.  As of 1/29/07 it has not been taken off my credit card.  How would you rate my review
I was very pleased with the improvement of picture quality (colour and clarity) over the standard playstation cable. Anyone with an S-Video input should consider making this simple upgrade
I had read other's reviews about how great this coffee was, but I was using another coffee that I thought was really wonderful.  I tried this one and now I am hooked.  It is wonderful if you like bold coffee, which I do.  I also like the fact that it is Organic.  I don't drink a lot of coffee each day, but the cup or two I have, I want to be great.  Just wish they had a decaf for my evening coffee
Me and a friend bought 2 of these.  They look really cool.  However they are not sharp at all (hence only 4 stars).  For $15 they are really good value though.  The hilt is plastic and the blade is a little thin.  Other than that they are quite good. 
If you have dry skin on your hands these gloves are very nice.  I place mine in the microwave for 15 seconds while I apply moisturizer to my hands.  Slide the gloves onto your hands as soon as the microwave is finished.  In 15 minutes you have a quick, but effective moisturizing treatment.  If your hands are really dry you could do the same thing but leave them on overnight.  I found the overnight option to be a little warm on my hands.  But, it might work fine for you. ---  --- These socks are 94% cotton and 6% Spandex.  They can be machine washed and tumbled dried.  I have not found it necessary launder them each time I use them.  I use a light moisturizer (Cetaphil), so you might have a different experience if you use a heavier product to moisturize. ---  --- I would highly recommend this product.
This is our 3rd addition to the Lafuma XL model, we also have 2 regular Lafuma models.  This is the most comfortable chair and we camp every weekend and everyone fights over these chairs.  The XL model is great for my family because we are all 6ft tall or more and the width has more room too.  Highly recommend
"To Live," does not hold the same appeal for me as it once did in the past. However, I do recommend viewers to at least take a look at this film. The films narrative deals with the lives of Fugui and Jiazhen, a husband and wife with two children, as well as Fugui's mother. The time period is from the 1940s up to the 1980s. Because Fugui has a gambling problem the family loses everything: house and possessions, which splits the family apart. It is a time when the Chinese Nationalist's and Communist's are battling for control of China. Further, the film deals with the social upheaval that is afffecting the lives of many Chinese. Although the film never criticizes the changes incurred by Mao Tse Tung, just the view of the how people's lives were affected accomplishes this task very well. ---  --- And although this film does not look deeply enough at the changes taking place in China in the chaotic 40s, 50s, and 60s with Mao's reforms and its affects on the people; I don't think that this is what the director had in mind. Especially regarding the films main protagonists. On later viewings I realized that there was much missing in the film which could have made this a truly great film. As the viewer, one witnesses the changes occuring in China, but the real horror of Mao's reforms are put on the backburner. There is social upheaval occuring, but it appears tame in comparison to actual events. However, Fugui and his pregnant wife are the films main protagonists, and the film is about their life in this new China. With poverty now a way of life, Fugui decides to work at a puppet troupe. After the birth of their first child [a son] Jiazhen returns to Fugui, however, civil war has broken out causing Fugui to leave for the fight. The rise of Mao changes everything for these two individuals in the films narrative. ---  --- And even though they have suffered [as many other did too] they never complain. The film never throws Mao at the viewer, but he is left in the background of the film. However, this was a very clever use of directing in order to tell the story of these two individuals. This is a decent film of human tragedy, which I only feel could have been so much more. I recommend the film to those viewers [rent it first] who are not familiar with this period in Chinese history. This is not a propaganda film, but a film about those caught in the unheaval of turbulent times. Recommended. [Stars: 4.5
IT is amazing to me how something like this could even be approved for the market - This pump is 100% JUNK.  SO Bad, that I am finding my self actually writing a review about a bicycle pump.  The instructions were a disaster.... and why would I need to look at instructions for a pump? - Well, that is because it does not work, and I mean does not work at all!  The lever on the side is a total gimmick (does nothing as the previous review states).  Save your money here - Do NOT buy this pump. 
I am a personal trainer and I was asked by a friend to check this "elliptical" strider out for them.  I was suspicious from the price thinking that it really couldn't be an elliptical machine but checked it out anyway.   --- As I suspected, this is simply a glider similar to what was on infomercials years ago. Except for the Tony Little TV glider most of those 20 or more gliders that were on the market are all gone. There is a simple reason that true elliptical machines are so popular in health clubs and that there are NO gliders in health clubs. With ellipticals and treadmills users lift their legs with each stride which of course is more like the natural motion of walking and running.  This of course engages many more muscles than the gliding or swinging machines of the past. Also ellipticals have a flywheel to allow the user to add resistance while still keeping a smooth motion.  --- I've read the other reviews of this machine and realize that certainly any movement is better compared to doing nothing.  But it is a question of time.  You could swing on one of these machines for hours and while it might be kind of fun for some people it will never come close to a true elliptical.  I'm not promoting any one brand and I have no ax to grind, except that it is somewhat annoying when companies like Sharper Image continue to intentionally mislead the public because they know it sells products. The reason elliptical machines are called "elliptical" is that the user's foot goes through an elliptical path.  Gliders just swing back and forth like a pendulum.  If you don't believe me ask any trainer or exercise physiologist.  This is misleading marketing and no doubt they know they are using that name to cash in on the popularity of the real ellipticals.  My advice to my friend was to save a little more money and get an elliptical.  --- 
I've tried 6 different nursing bras. This one, with the center snap closure, is the easiest to use. It is also the lightest and most comfortable, while providing good support. My only complaint is that after about 50 washes the underwire begins to poke free from the fabric. Even when I try to sew it back into place, it breaks loose after a few washes. Perhaps if I handwashed the bra instead of using a machine, it would last longer. This bra is less durabe than my other nursing bras (particularly the Leading Lady bra, which seems to be indestructible), but it is well worth the sacrifice for comfort, lightness, and ease of use. It is by far my favorite
This Garinin autowinder does exactly what it is supposed to do.  Keeps both my autos running and ready for use.  It is quiet, smooth, and looks pretty good sitting atop my computer desk.  It has a variety of settings that will meet the needs of almost any auto watch on the market.  It is well built, and works as described
if you can make it work or if you are lucky to get a non defective unit: ---  --- it can only read 1 card at a time --- needs specific usb power requirements (needs the usb power be +5v and not +5vsb) else you will get "USB hub power exceeded errors" the worst part is that the mainboard i tested is +5v... and still didn't work --- the cards inserted on the lower card slots have to be inserted upside down --- from time to time you can get the message usb device not recognized... ---  --- contacted support... service there = average/not so good (support forum has several topics complaining about this product) ---  --- couldn't get a replacement since 30 days tigerdirect warranty have expired, can't send the unit to ultra because currently I'm outside the US and as i stated customer service is not good. ---  ---  --- bottom line ---  --- don't buy this item ---  --- 
I ordered these items in mid June, and my credit card was billed on June 22.  However I discovered two weeks later that, despite your having billed my credit card for items being purchased from Andrew Christian, the order had never been sent to them.  I was then assured that the order would be completed promptly (I told them I needed the clothing by July 19, otherwise I would not need the items at all)).  The order was not given to UPS until July 17 with an expected delivery date of July 21. Consequently I directed UPS to return the order unopened.  The handling of the entire mess was slopppy, and the billing of my credit card two weeks before the order was even placed was unethical and shameful. 
I loved the watch when I first received it.  I wore it two or three times, then a piece of the wire mess that the band is made of broke and was sticking up.  I tried to bend it around but the loose wire continued to snag my clothes so I stopped wearing it. --- 
I am such a huge fan of the Philosophy Grace line that I thought I would really love this, too.  I find that it is much too light for me.  It does smell exactly like cotton candy which is nice, but it doesn't last long at all.  I guess I'll have to really spray a lot for anyone to even notice I'm wearing it.  Nobody has said anything so far.  The shower gel is a waste as far as scent goes...wonderful lather, but no smell to speak of.  I will stick with Amazing Grace, Baby Grace and Pure Grace.  Those are wonderful
As the title says, the remote sensor died a quick death so I got a replacement unit. The remote sensor died on that one pretty quickly as well. ---  --- I know that sometimes things go wrong with good products, but two sensors dying so quickly apparently was not a fluke. This is a cheaply made piece of equipment, so I guess you get what you pay for. ---  --- I gave a friend an Oregon Scientific unit three years ago and it is still going strong, so I'd advise you to stay away from La Crosse and go with Oregon Scientific
Esquire is a subpar Men's magazine, in my opinon.  More than half of the magazine is advertisements, and when you finally get to the articles they are rarely entertaining and/or thought-provoking.  If you like ads and cologne samples, pick it up.  After all, it is pretty decently priced
Hard to believe this product is still being sold when it's not even friendly with the current hot selling ipods.  Also the claims of good design I feel are overstated.  Finally the speakers are weak and sound like it won't be long until they're shaking, this may influence what music you'll end up playing through the system. ---  --- All said, though, I'd be happy with it for the price if only they'd update it to fully handle my ipod
One of the most disastrous purchases we've ever made.  It works fine until you try to get the video images onto your computer.  Don't bother trying to consult the instruction guide; it's the worst one you've ever seen.  You could go to the website to attempt to download all the drivers that you supposedly need, but they're not actually on the website. ---  --- DEFINITELY find another brand
One of the best DS games I ever had. It does not take to be a lawyer to get fully satisfied with this game. Although this is a heavily text-based game (I mean really heavy!), you won't get tired of reading the storylines and following the details. I know you won't find this in any stores nowadays so try to order here at Amazon. This game's one of the best
I don't know what other people are complaining about. I just installed Vista Ultimate a few days ago and I absolutely love it. No interface lag or any other lag at all. Maybe the people complaining have weak or outdated hardware. Those people need to turn down their settings if their not going to keep their computers on the cutting edge or at least near it. I'm glad Microsoft isn't waiting for people to catch up and are on the cutting edge. I'd rather be the one catching up than the other way around. ---  --- I have a Core 2 Duo e6300 overclocked to 2.5Ghz, 2 gigs of ram, a Geforce 7600gt and a Western Digital Raptor 150g HD and Vista Ultimate works flawlessly on my computer. It's not the best computer but it runs flawlessly, I built it myself and all the parts cost me about $850 off the net. I play World of Warcraft among some other games and I haven't seen any problems yet with any games or any of the major software I use as of yet. I've only encountered one problem and that was with my old Soundblaster Live! 5.1 sound card which has discontinued support. No big deal, it was about time to get a better one anyway. Vista is awesome, I love everything about it. It's very futuristic and it is not a simple interface makeover at all like some clueless dummies proclaim. ---  --- By the way, I only paid $110 for Vista Ultimate Upgrade off eBay, check there first if you already have an existing OS and want to save some dough
Its a pretty good mix, good song choices, its mostly a harder mix, thought it could be smoother flowing though, but all in all its pretty good, also thought the robot walk to the party deal woulda made a better begining, it was a lot of down time during the middle of the cd, but hey people gotta switch it up now and then, like the last 3/4s better...
I am very happy with this chair.  It was pretty easy to assemble and it is very comfortable and seems incredibly sturdy, which is important for a big guy like me.  The wheels are a little tough to roll on my somewhat deep office carpet, so some people might want to consider adding some sort of plastic pad to place underneath.  But this is a great product
I remember putting Season 9 as the worst season of Friends in my book, but it's not as bad as I remembered. Some episodes are actually incredibly funny. The faux pas was when they started to have Aisha Tyler guess star as Charlie, and have her come between Joey and Ross. Also, the whole story line with Rachel's infatuation for Joey could've been better executed, or shouldn't have been there at all. It got bad towards the end, but I'm not disappointed. The stuff leadings towards it was classic Friends
I just got through reading "Harvey Penick's Little Red Book".  I enjoyed it so much that I had to apologize about my delay in submitting a positive comment on the seller's feedback page. But the book was that enjoyable! I read the book because I was told it is a good example in marketing and business management ideals.  I don't even play golf! I was able to apply Harvey Penick's words to attitudes and approaches to life though!  He not only teaches what he has learned about golf during his long rich life, but he also teaches a philosophy in how to live one's life.  His methods of evaluating the actions of his students and sharing what he has learned in an effort to improve thier lives is obvious to me.  He refuses to use negative impressions in his teachings.  Instead, he accentuates the positive.  He educates by guiding his students instead of "teaching" them.  I love his ability to teach with images, parables and metaphors.  His chapter "First Things First" about the golfer who wanted to get out of sand traps is great!  After all, the problem is not always what you think.  I challenge anyone to read "Harvey Penick's Little Red Book" and share with me how they can apply his knowledge to thier business and personal lives.  Whether you play golf or not, this book is good reading
The Concert in Central Park is not only the best of Simon & Garfunkel's concerts, it is one of the best of anyone's concerts, in my estimation. The crowd was really in to it, and Simon and Garfunkle responded to them and delivered a top notch experience which captured the essence of the best of their music, and the era it was written in. --- I have owned the VCR tape for years, and enjoyed it many times, but the signal was beginning to fade, so I was very pleased to see it released on DV
What a great account of the nations oldest law enforcement agency.  The book is full of information about the Marshals service, it's mission, and it's history.  You'll also get to know some interesting personalities in  the Marshals service along the way. I am a Deputy Sheriff myself, as well  as a history buff.  From that Perspective, I throughly enjoyed this book  and couldn't put it down.  Mr. Sabbag, thanks for a great look into the  world of the U.S. Marshals. And as for Deputy U.S. Marshal Victor Oboyski -  I'd be happy to "do a door" with you anytime
There is no way to keep this product in place in the mouth other than by keeping pressure on it with your teeth. This defeats the purpose of a product that is supposed to help reduce the grinding and clenching of teeth. Very disappointing.
While not every song my be my favorite, they really did a great job compiling the popular and favorites from the great 80s hair band days! --- All the monster CDS I have bought have been real gems.
Great Price. Super nice watch
Really like this weather station. It seems very accurate in temperature and humidity readings both indoor and outdoor. Finding the proper batteries for the outdoor unit was a hassel in this area. Shipping was fast and am very pleased.
I love the feel of a good writing instrument and own several Mont Blancs and other fine pens.  The Waterman was an outstanding addition to my collection and is one of the pens I use often.  It is comfortable in the hand, has an elegant design and writes wonderfully
Wow! I was totally surprised at how nice this instrument was when it arrived! I thought at such a low price it would be a low-quality trumpet, but its really absolutely perfect for my first-time trumpeter daughter. You won't be disappointed if you purchase this. PLUS Austin Bazaar sent a nice information letter along with their shipping notice on how to take care and assemble your instrument
I originally had to read this book for a History of Rock and Roll class at the University of Cincinatti. I found the subject interesting, and the professor gave wonderful lectures. I had good expectations about this book going in, but those quickly soured as I read it. ---  --- It seems correct, at least, about the social problems of the different eras and their relation to rock. Not that such is a particularly daunting feet. ---  --- However, it is rife with laughable fallacies. For instance, it calls David Bowie, amongst other glam rock bands of the era, metal. It futher goes on to call many pop bands of the 60s and 70s rock, when they have no guitar work and no bass line at all, such as the Carpenters. ---  --- I really had a good laugh when they called Bad Religion hardcore. Bad Religion is about as hardcore as Elvis is rap. Further massive genre confusion consisted throughout the entire book. ---  --- I also noted several drastic misinterpretations of songs. For instance, it claims 'Thunder Rolls' by Garth Brooks is about domestic violence. Its about infedility, not focusing on violence at all, but rather the emotional ramificationsof being cheated on. ---  --- The writing is also rather dry. Many times it is merely a citing of the names of band members as well as constantly describing minor changes in bands lineups which are of no true consequence. It also tends to list off songs which have no impact on any giving band's successes or failures. ---  --- After reading the book in completetion, I really had to question the earlier passages about older rock and blues (50s to 60s) that I had thought were true. In the end, I felt that it wasted my time and money and possibly misinformed me more than anything
This camera was the best "little" camera I have ever owned. --- It is so amazing. --- It takes fantastic pictures and it is cheap
Vanilla Sky is either a disappointment when viewed against Indie Film standards, or a happily confusing lark when compared to the unending deluge of big budget / low-minded Hollywood that's released weekly. ---  --- On the plus side, we find a movie that engages the viewer and the mind. A movie that is certainly confusing at first sitting, it is that rare commodity: the movie we like to talk about later. Like Memento or Barton Fink, people will find themselves dissecting the minutiae of the film after it's over. ---  --- Also impressive is the fact that Tom Cruise, one of Hollywood's famed pretty boys, spends at least two-thirds of the film either hidden under a mask, or horribly disfigured. Not a role many other actors would jump to take. ---  --- On the down side, Vanilla Sky, (a re-make ?) is basically an Art House or Indie film starring a big Hollywood actor. What could have been an interesting view on the hidden nature of man, or alternate/multiple realities, or even a study on the nature of reality itself, instead ends up like an art house rip-off of Total Recall. ---  --- Rating: B- / C+ ---  --- FYI:  --- 1) When did the universe change so much that "Banky" from Chasing Amy could get a lead role playing opposite Tom Cruise? --- 2) When did Penelope Cruz get the role of Indecipherable Speaker, ala Brad Pitt in Snatch or Fenster in The Usual Suspects? --- 3) When did Paul McCartney last have a decent single? Here, with the title track
This is my favorite soap in the world.  A new bar will scent my bathroom for weeks, and the scent lingers on my skin as well.  The soap is gentle and long-lasting. I recommend it highly
Can someone who bought the kit from ADORAMA tell me: --- 1) The battery is the Canon genuine NB-1LH battery? --- 2) The camera case is canon PSC-50 case?  ---  --- Thank you in advance
Do not buy this.  Go with Mac OS X 4.2 Tiger, it doesn't crash or lock up.  Plus you will get access to really cool applications out of the box that lets you do almost anything media-wise.  I could go one for hours how the Macintosh operating system is better but I will say one last thing...  Tiger is faster than Windows.  Research has proved that Tiger and all the other operating systems conserve CPU performance to such an extent that 90%-100% of the speed is left for applications and such.  Windows eats up so much speed along with DOS that from 20%-30% of the performance is left for the user.  That puts a normal Windows computer (3Ghz) at less than 1Ghz.  While a normal Mac computer (2Ghz) runs at 2Ghz.  Plus the fastest Mac is a dual G5 each running at 2.7Ghz.  So actual speed is 5.4Ghz.  The fastest Windows computer is around 3.6Ghz which runs around 1Ghz.  That is a HUGE difference (5.4Ghz-1Ghz.)  When Apple moves to Intel chips next year (about,) The Macs will run around 6.4Ghz if not more.  That is an even MORE HUGE difference.  Take my word for it.  The Windows world is not worth it.  Whenever I go on my Mom's computer (which is running on Windows XP,) I encounter a lock up or annoying hickup in the OS, EVERY TIME!!  I agree that a good amount of people don't find Windows to be unstable, but even when I go to a friend's house I notice them there as well.  Every Windows computer I have used for more than 20 minutes has locked up.  But it's not just this, it's also that Tiger is so much easier to use. ---  --- Take my advice (I've converted many people) and switch to Mac... Please.  I swear that most of you who read this and switch will be very pleased.  It might be a little wierd at first to get used to the new OS, but I mastered it in a day when it took me months on Windows.  Plus you can purchase Microsoft Word for Mac as well (which I think is easier to use than the Window's counterpart.) ---  --- So go and throw that ugly Windows computer away and get a spanking new, shiny white, STABLE, Mac!!!
It says it supports Mac all over the package. However it doesn't support,  and cannot be made to support Mac  files that allow a wider use of characters for naming files. For instance, when I drag a folder over this icon to copy it starts copying until it comes to a file that has been named "ilegally" or uses a prohibited character. It says that it cannot copy this file and gives you the prompt "OK"?.  "OK" is your only choice to click on.  By clicking on  "OK" the job terminates and you have a partially copied folder.  How is that for compatibility? How is that for delivering backup assurance? I feel swindled.  The product has a geeky feel to it also with lots of acronyms an geek speak.  Mine will probably become landfill and be written off as an expensive education about doing more research than simply trusting the copy on the box. It's Mac compatible as long as you adopt PC conventions in how you operate your Mac.  Run Mac owners... Ru
I agree that this magazine boasts designer clothing with extremely high prices that most people cannot afford, but may people be aware that this magazine is called "Teen Vogue" and obviously will follow in it's big sister's footsteps.  --- "Vogue" does not feature clothes from Walmart, and so "Teen Vogue" will not either. --- This magazine does not necessarily cater to only rich people. who says that a person should only buy a magazine when she is going to get the exact clothes featured in it? I am definitely no millionaire. I'm 16 years old and still in High school, but I enjoy this magazine immensely.Of course I dont slip out to Marc Jacobs when i'm done reading and get myself the shirt on page 79, but I do look at the styles so i can understand the new trends and just inspire myself some. magazines dont always have to be realistic. fashion is about pursuing beauty and covetting beauty, and if all magazines only featured "affordable clothes' from Walmart and Old Navy, well.. I really wouldnt know what that would be like. --- "Teen Vogue" is a pure fashion magazine. it isnt an all-round magazine for young girls. it's only fashion. and it does a great job at what it strives for. the fashion is great and the taste is great, the shoots are amazing. a former reviewer reccomended "Seventeen" and I want to note that "Seventeen" is a different type of magazine entirely. Seventeen is extremely mainstream bubblegum and is not very fashion orientated. personally i do not like that magazine but i'm not going to condemn it here.  --- "Teen Vogue" is classy, stylish, and lives up to it's name. you dont have to be a rich kid to read this magazine. but it's the only teen magazine out there which is dedicated souly to high fashion and yes, features the best fashion.  people who are not interested in fashion will probably hate this magazine, and that is probably why it has recieved so much criticism. I, on the other hand, love this magazine. the only reason i didnt give it five stars is because the reviews above deemed the stuff in it affordable for young girls and that does strike me as ridiculous. --- otherwise, look to this magazine for some fantastic fashion inspiration
These sweaters are a fantastic value for $18.  Quality is excellent, though the colored trim may not appeal to all tastes.  Note that the fabric is somewhat thicker than most merino wool sweaters and the sizing on this model is a little snugger than the other Raffi merino sweaters
I've been pregnant or nursing for most of the last 4 years and I've tried a LOT of different nursing bras.  I got this one several months ago and absolutely love it.  I've been reasonably happy with the Bravado line in general -- they hold up very, very well, stay comfortable, and remain supportive over time-- but I just wasn't fond of the sports bra styling of their original one.  I am often between bra sizes (between 34 and 36, between B and C cups, depending on the maker) and due to a habit of nursing more on the right side than the left, often have one breast larger than the other.  The 36C fits me very comfortably with no noticeable bunching,lines, or that nasty "spillover" when it's been too long between feedings.  I wear fairly fitted cotten shirts just about every day of the year so it's really important to me to have a bra that fits smoothly.  The only other nursing bra that I've found that works as well under t-shirts is a Mimi brand one that it costs just about as much, but doesn't hold its shape for very long.  Basically, this is a comfortable bra that is easy to use and will last
This is a great collection of hits from the 70's. It is packed with hits. It is a great addition to a 70's hits collection
I felt like I was taking a piss on myself the whole time I listened to this album. What happened to the 40 water of the old days that used to rap with spice 1, 2pac, and mc breed? This clone of 40 raps with the likes of Lil jon (wack as hell), washed up 80 year old too short, and a bunch of losers I have never heard of. The album only gets props because eightball and mjg are on the album and ugk. And they almost played themselves by appearing on this god awful so called "album". E-40 has fallen into this commercial west coast version of crunk called "hyphy" in attempts to breathe life into his lifeless career. The album has some decent beats on it but there is no kind of lyrical content to be found anywhere. E-40 wouldn't know lyrical content if I slapped him with a Krs-One cd. This cd is wack simple and plain, Pee-40 is a beat waster, and he needs to find the nearest car wash and start drying off cars!!
I didn't want to spend a lot of money on an Ionic Hair Dryer.  I came across this one and thought I'd give it a try.  The light indicating the Ionic Generator is working stopped working after its first use. What a waste of money!
We used this for my newborn daughter up until 3 months when her digestive system finally started to mature enough to not have gas frequently.  As a previous reviewer stated, sometimes it works, sometimes not, so I combined it with the recommended dosage for Infant Gas Drops and that would do the trick.  I found Little Tummy's brand at Babies-R-Us, which is less expensive and is the same thing.   ---  --- Later, after 6 months and trying new foods, there has been a couple of occasions when you could tell something didn't agree with her.  I gave her the recommended dosage for her age and she'd clearly feel better
The writing was not what I expect of Andre Norton. Too many gaps and information that is disjointed. Whether this is a consequence of collaboration I don't know. I felt this should have had a strong editor to point out where things should be tightened. For example - at the start we know Kirion has sent people to capture his sister. The book covers over 2 years, but you hardly hear of this again. I cannot imagine the sorcerer would just have let it drop. --- I am a long-time fan and retired children's librarian. Sic Fi & fantasy is my favorite genre, but this one I had to push to finish. Unsatisfying. --- 
Now on their sixth studio album (and second on a major label) Carbon Leaf plays it safe with the inoffensive rock/pop of "Love, Loss, Hope, Repeat." Lead vocalist Barry Privett has a warm, pleasant way of delivering his lyrics, and renowned producer Peter Collins fulfills his duties. Nevertheless, the 11-song collection is most notable for its power of subtlety. In fact, it is so subtle that not one song is memorable. ---  --- Some lyrics are heartfelt ("The War Was In Color" recounts a conversation between a grandfather and grandson, lead single "Learn to Fly" regretfully summons up inner strength) but with such flat, by-the-numbers melodies these songs have little to stand on. Everything sounds just fine, but nothing is endearing. Every guitar strum and drum beat can be predicted ten seconds prior to its appearance, and Privett, despite his appealing voice, could easily be singing one extremely long song.  ---  --- This project is obviously well-intentioned, but many other bands have done this before and better. These guys without a doubt have talent, but this album will soon be forgotten for good reason. Next time they will hopefully carve out a more unique sound than the one on this record.
In theory this boot seemed perfect: added some height , came in  perfectly wearable colors, was made of real leather, the price was unbeatable , BUT ( yes, unfortunately a big but)like everything else which seems perfect , it was perfectly flawed . I did my research,read the reviews and ordered a boot half size bigger than my usual . But still was super tight across the ankle and top of my feet , totally crushing my veins. I'm a big "shoe collector" and I can recognize a design error when I see one. Surprisingly that it came from this brand , usually so quality-reliable . These boots are not meant for walking . If you want to take a pretty picture in them , they might fulfill THAT purpose 
These shoes are proof that God loves us and wants us to be happy
Finally a GF/CF granola! This stuff is amazing!  I got it for my husband and daughter (2) who are GF/CF, but I love this stuff too!  And I am truly not a nuts and seed person, but I can't stop eating it!  I'm so happy to be able to give my daughter a snack that has such great protein in it and is so easy to eat! My husband is just going to keep a bag in his car to snack on
We received a Graco travel system from our registry, and got some good use out of it. However, we are in a big city, and the stroller just couldn't stand up to the bad sidewalks and roads. Not to mention it was so rickety I'm positive we could be heard a mile away. I broke down and ordered the Jeep Liberty Limited Urban Terrain jogger, and I LOVE it.  ---  --- 1. It was simple to assemble. --- 2. It is easier on my hands and wrists to steer. --- 3. The air-filled tires provide a much smoother ride for my daughter. --- 4. The toy steering wheel? She FREAKS out over it, in a good way. She *beeped* her horn about 30 consecutive times in the grocery store. Since that distracted her from pulling boxes off the shelves, I am ultra pleased.  --- 5. The price is wonderful. ---  --- We don't use the Music On The Move feature, so I can't really comment on it. I fill the tires right before we leave the house every time, and it's not hard to do, so I have no complaints there.  ---  --- It is a bulky item, so transporting it and carrying it is a bit tricky. However, the pros all outweigh the cons for me. I am extremely pleased with it
This has always been one of my alltime cinema favorites and I was happy to see it available on DVD.  The story, the script, the direction, and the acting are superb. 
I love how this product works and feels on my skin!! Does an excellent job off removing makeup and cleaning the skin with out drying your skin out! Makes skin feel cool and clean!! ---  --- I have very sensitive skin an was concerned that this product was going to break my skin out OR be very drying because this product tones as well as cleanses the skin. But that  wasn't the case. My skin didn't break out, nor is this product drying. Highly recommend!
I decided to try this game because it was listed as a similar game that customers purchased with other games that I really like. I am a fan of Longest Journey, Syberia, Gabriel Knight, Broken Sword, etc. etc. I wasn't expecting a whole lot when I started Keepsake, but I was looking to kill time because I love PC games. From the very start, I was swept into the story, the setting, the characters (I LOVE it when there is a fun mascot sharing your adventures!). The voice-overs and some graphics really are pretty unrefined, but that also makes the game more endearing. These factors could be the reasons this game is not listed way up there with some of the other titles I mention. I have added it to my list of favorite games, and I play games ALOT
This lock works good for a little while, then the push mechanism breaks.  It may or may not break completely off, so it could still work even when it breaks.  I've gone through two of these already, and they only lasted a few months before they broke
If you need something to get you going in the morning, Shock Therapy will do it.  We're talking major minty shower gel here--your skin will be tingling.  The smell clears the mind and gets the blood flowing to the brain.  A gift note: this would be a good gift for someone who doesn't like flowery bath products; even guys would like this
I read several different on-line reviews for this CD before I purchased it. Each seemed to imply that this CD was a new direction for Jaci, that her lyrics were bolder and the overall sound was much more independent in nature. Strange. I must have purchsed the Prozac copy of this CD because there is nothing new here from her. Like my title line to this review states, it's the exact same music she has always sang, just in a different package. Now the CD just collects dust. What a shame
I wonder if Jance wrote this just to get a movie credit based on her novel. One cannot help but be suspicious of writers who shift gears in their careers and write in a Tom Clancy or John D. Macdonald style just because that's what film-going audiences like. I do not think this is a bad thing, but I, like some of the reviewers here, are so fed up with clich plots that just borrow from i.e., Macdonald's "Cape Fear," or use that tired Native American romanticism that certainly sells the box office tickets through the roof. As for her writing style, she really should stay away from those scenes where character developments have not fully grown. What we're left with are people who are one dimensional like both the Walker parents, Davy, his fiancee, and to some extent, Lani, who just never convinced me that she had the fire of the budding Medicine Woman. Her male voice is very forced machismo that is typical of female writers who are testosterone-challenged. The men in this novel just weren't credible when they spoke. I kept seeing Jance speaking for them. So we're left with a high-concept piece that is still waiting for Hollywood to call and possibly star Penelope Cruz as Lani Walker. What's the Tohono O'otham word for "2 thumbs down?&quot
my kid played the game for 5 min only, it is not fun. if you want to try it just rent i
The program works fine on Windows XP and is easy to use. It lets you print cards of many sizes. The big disappointment is in the number of cards that comes with the program. The back of the box claims "4500+ Cards and Sentiments, Celebrate life's special moments with cards for all occasions". That's nice. The problem with that is that I counted the total number of cards that come with the program.  It only adds up to 1045! So where are the other 3450+ cards and sentiments? Are you supposed to design them yourself? I just don't know. And certainly "cards for all occasions" means just that, doesn't it?  Well there's lots of birthday cards and plenty of holiday cards but not one sympathy card of any kind. I guess you just need to buy those on your own
This is a good computer Bible, but for the money, I prefer a program like AMG Bible Essentials which has the Libronix Library System built-in and can be integrated with other Bible study software.  For about $15 more the AMG program has both KJV, Apocrypha and NASB, including a lot of other capability, like Greek translations, word study, exegesis, parallel Bible comparisons, etc.  The Rainbow Bible is an older issue and shows its age by not offering features as mentioned above.  Some benefits of this Bible include both NIV and KJV translations, color maps, Matthew Henry's commentary, Naves and a version of Foxe's Book of Martyrs. The various colors can be distracting at times, but overall it is worth considering, particularly if you like the NIV
I have tried I think every product on the market.  Nothing was helping my acne, it just kept getting worse.  I still have a bad complexion but nothing like it used to be after trying this.  I loved it.  It did dry my skin out a little,  but whatever works!   My skin is clearer and smoother,  it just isn't perfect,  but who is
I have used this type of inexpensive wireless mic before and the others I tried had much better sensitivity. You have to touch this mic with your lips to be herd. There are better choices even in this price range
This movie is great. I remember watching it when I was really young. Im 21 now and still love it. Yeah some things are corny but that is part of what makes it great. Its not suppose to be realistic. Its fiction! I just realized too that the daughter is the girl from American Pie which makes it even funnier. Overall this movie is pretty good. If you dont care for the story, atleast get it to see Kim and the other chicks in the movie. If you've never seen the movie, just buy it. Its about the same as renting it a couple times and you will be able to keep it. For all you people who rated it a 1 you have issues!   
My 5 month old daughter always put her face into the bumpers on her crib so I stopped putting her in the crib because I was afraid of her sufficating and without the bumbers her hands and feet could still get in between the rails on the crib and because she moves aroung so much I was afraid of her hurting herself. So now I love puttingher in the crib because the bumpers are mesh and I don't have to worry. They were also real simple to put on because of the velcro and when you change the sheet on the crib its alot easier to get the matress back in because the bumper is so flat. Great product! I highly recommend it!!!!
The joke here is that Krugman is convinced he can write.  He ends his little intro with the smug assertion that "maybe economists can write after all," offering himself as proof.  (Krugman cannot write well, but he has mastered the clumsy, undistinguished style of a bad lit professor---the kind of tenured mediocrity that dominates academic publishing---an accomplishment he's very proud of.  To use his own favorite "emphasizing" gimmick: Krugman stinks---full stop.) ---  --- The punchline is that shortly afterward, The New York Times hired him.  It was a match made in middlebrow heaven.  (I should add that I do like the substance of Krugman's newspaper articles, if not the style.  An enemy of the current White House is a friend of mine.) ---  --- As far as the economics go, he's pro-NAFTA and pro-"free trade" just like all establishment economists, and completely unwilling to critique the real forces at work in international markets.  Don't waste your time
the best.not exacley a shaRK MOVIE not very many people die.lots of action and your in suspense not cause of the shark. cause of the people you dont now who to trust.good movie see it see if youl like it
I was impatient to buy the successor of my beloved Treo 650, and did so last January by upgrading to the Treo 680. I have been a faithful customer of Palm technology since 1997, and for the first time, I am disappointed. Of course, I still have the friendly Palm OS, tailor made for smart phones. I also have upgrade compatibility for my 15,000 records stored in the Treo's four main applications. But the minuscule battery of the 680 forces me to curtail Versamail sync and phone conversations, and its clumsy command bar results in unexpected commands (contrary to the 650, buttons are too close to each other). Reliability of the 680 is also left to be desired, especially compared with the 650 after firmware update. Finally, I use Intellisync for dual sync with both user-friendly Palm Desktop and heavy duty email MS Outlook; the acquisition of Pumatech by Nokia results in a clumsy new release of Intellisync for Treo: Intellisync new version added a record number in the "note" field of all my records ! I quickly reverted to an older Intellisync version and I wonder what will happen when I need to upgrade with  MS Office 2007 compatibility... Nokia's low blow to Palm ? It is time Palm responds with a decent dual sync solution of their own. If not, it's decided: I will switch to the Pearl
Carl Hiaasen spins a tale of adventure and humor that should motivate young readers to protect wildlife and natural resources. Hoot is set in the seaside town of Coconut Cove. The plot revolves around Mother Paula's Pancake House, a fictitious restaurant chain in Florida about to build its 100th store on a parcel of land inhabited by families of burrowing owls. The developers know about the endangered owls and removed legal evidence of the owls from public records. Unwary citizens applaud Mother Paula's in Coconut Cove.  ---  --- The lone crusader for the owls is a boy nicknamed Mullet Fingers who lives in the backwoods dodging truant officers. He pulls up construction stakes and invents other nocturnal forays to stop development. Mullet Fingers enlists the help of his step sister, Beatrice and new kid, Roy. Beatrice is a middle-school soccer queen who holds her own with the boys. Roy is a level-headed kid who moves to Coconut Cove from Montana, earning the dubious title of Cowgirl.  ---  --- When you throw in a zany cop, a redneck construction boss, a sly businessman, a high school teacher willing to support kids acting for righteous causes and a bully whose attempts to squash Roy you've got a pretty good read!
yes!  yes!  yes!  this marshmallow cream is amazing.  i'm diabetic with an enormous sweet tooth and this stuff is a g-dsend.  sooo yummy and sweet without that weird, cloying aftertaste or mouthfeel.  just marshmallow goodness.  i'm sure, as other reviewers have suggested, it has many uses.  maybe i'll discover some of them with my next batch; the first batch got eaten plain -- it was *that* good.  (i am thinking of bringing it camping so that when the rest of the family has their s'mores around the campfire, i can make a little tin foil packet of my own with this, chocolate and graham crackers and rest it in the coals.  how good would that be?!
After slogging through a number of these reviews it is clear that most cannot see that we Twenty-First Century Americans were not the intended audience for this movie. The movie was intended to be a unifying morale-builder for the National Socialist Party in Germany, which had been in power only about a year when this movie was made.  ---  --- From its loss of World War I until the NSDAP was elected to power in Germany in 1934, the people had suffered every kind of internecine mob warfare, illegal abuse and theft of whole portions of Germany at the hands of the French, and an economic catastrophe that made our American Depression look like a picnic by comparison.  ---  --- This movie sought to persuade Germans (GERMANS!) that this dreadful misery was finally over and that the criminal Bolshevik traitors responsible for Germany's defeat in World War I, and all the residual woes, would be defeated once and for all. It must have been a most welcome message because as you watch the film you certainly don't get the impression that anyone had to beg the many thousands of Germans who attended the NSDAP rallies to stand up and cheer their hearts out.  ---  --- If you speak and understand German, you'll have a much greater likelihood of being able to understand the impact of these rallies, and this film that celebrates them. For many who are not conversant in the German language or who know little about the actual history of the time besides what they were exposed to in American World War II films, the film is actually pretty boring after a while.   ---  --- You sit there and watch one group of soldiers, police, or workers after another, marching and marching and marching. This is interspersed with speeches by Hitler and the other Party officals. From time to time you'll see interesting-looking people doing everyday things, some in costume, but mostly they're just talking, walking, eating, brushing their teeth, and so on. Be advised -- for those of you who expect the whole thing to be a stirring, gigantic SS parade with weapons bristling, be prepared to be disappointed. The last group of soldiers on parade are indeed the SS Leibstandarte Adolph Hitler, and they're marching to what was reputedly Hitler's favorite piece -- "Der Badenweiler". Remember to notice that they aren't even carrying rifles or bayonets.... ---  --- Lastly, in my opinon, the commentary by "historian" Dr Anthony Santoro is mostly just another sarcastic, demeaning rant against the people in the film, so typical of those who pronounce judgement on the vanquished after every war.  The marching soliders and other Germans who reverberated such thrills of hope for their poor, beleagured country are all long dead, but Santoro must make fun of them for the amusement (?) of the American audience. Try to remember -- this movie was not made for YOU!
I got this film because I'm from Detroit where this takes place. It's a pretty typical revenge flick. Four brothers want to find their adoptive mother's killer. Usual smartass remarks, guys talking BS, fights, shootouts, blah, blah, blah. I guess these kind of movies will always be made and when made well they can be fun to watch. This script was mediocre at best. Give me a Clint Eastwood or Bruce Willis film any day over this tripe. 
Picked mine up used on eBay for $180.  With the growth of the VR market everyone is dumping there old lenses.  You can get a used one for a great price.  This lens is great for the serious amatuer. ---  --- I have taken some incredible pictures with this lens.  The autofocus is a little slow and I have heard people complain about softness on the high end but I have a photo blown up to 20 x 17 taken from my D70 at 300mm.  Of course I shoot the photo on a tripod.... I have not experienced the softnes
The best bike ramp I have ever used. This ramp is good for going slow or fast. My friends and I went as slow as we could over it and we did not get stuck. This ramp will not breack. I live in an area of the country were it snows all the time and this ramp can handle the seasons. This ramp has been outside for two years and is in great condision
April of 1865 has been referred to as the month that saved America but April of 1861 may have been just as vital if not more so. It was during this time that Washington DC sat completely surrounded by two states that were teetering on the verge of secession. Once Virginia did leave the Union only Maryland provided the federal government with a connection to the rest of the nation and it was a tenuous connection at best.  ---  --- Abraham Lincoln was clearly out of his league in this early stage of the game and he leaned heavily on General Winfield Scott. For his part, Scott was keenly aware of the danger facing Washington and began to immediately call for any militia units that could get to DC quickly from loyal northern states. The problem was that these militia units would have to travel through Maryland, a slave state that might well consider these Yankee troops to be invaders and could easily be pushed into the Confederacy by such an affront to state sovereignty. It was also distinctly possible that these militia units might be attacked by not only the people of Maryland but also ultimately by the state militia. ---  --- In the meantime Virginia forces had seized the federal armory at Harper's Ferry and the Gosport navy yard near Hampton Virginia. Rumors are rampant in DC that the Virginia militia that had taken Harper's Ferry was preparing to move on Washington and many in the Federal City were in a state of panic.  ---  --- The questions that arise from this drama involve the decision making process on both sides and the ultimate question is of course whether Washington DC was ever in any real danger. Did the Confederacy in fact lose it's only real chance for ultimate victory during this time period? David Detzer has done an admirable job in this book of not only bringing this evolving drama to life but also of answering these questions in a clear and concise manner. ---  --- This book reads much like a great historical drama and the author's writing style is superbly readable. It is rare for the author of a history book to achieve such a sense of drama since the reader usually already knows the outcome. Detzer has accomplished this however and although I was keenly aware of what was about to happen at every turn I had a tough time putting the book down. This invigorating writing style is often derisively referred to as popular history but Detzer blows the sides off of that old mold by not only offering new information but also keen observations that cut directly to the heart of this eventful period of American history. No hero of American history is spared criticism when criticism is due and conversely even Ben Butler is praised when his actions merit it. ---  --- This is the story of those fateful days of April and May of 1861 and it is a story that is well told by this supremely able author. This book is well researched, very well written and the story is told from the point of view of both governments as well as the lowliest private in the Pennsylvania militia. It is a story upon which the fate of the United States once turned
I see a lot of people have had trouble tracking baseballs with this thing.  I've owned one for 3 years and it works pretty well.  I will give some tips on it: ---  --- !!!If you throw at a respectable speed, and don't follow the correct procedure it will not work - there will be no reading!! ---  --- 1) Don't stand behind a metal fence.  The Chain links with the plastic coating over them will work, but for whatever reason exposed metal interferes with the signal. ---  --- 2) The focus beam of the radar gun is very narrow.  The whole idea is to keep the beam on the ball as long as possible.  Just having the ball pass through the radar beam is not enough.  You need to keep the beam on the ball for practically the whole pitch. ---  --- 3) Use rechargable batteries... and this isn't to save money.  Some of the better Energizer rechargable are high amperage, 1350 mA and up.  The gun tends to respond better to this, as its pretty power hungry.  You will get more consistant readings with better batteries.  Non-rechargable batteries cannot provide the same level of current (usually 850 mA or less), which seem to effect the gun. ---  --- So, how would you properly use the gun? ---  --- One way is to stand behind the mound as the pitcher throws.  Forget about using it during a game, behind the backstop.  It wont work. ---  --- Try line up the pitchers release point and the plate, then situate your gun so that it fires on this imaginary line (connecting pitchers hand and the target.   ---  --- You may have to slightly change the angle of the gun to track the pitch, which can be slightly tricky.  Follow the ball with the gun as long as you can. ---  --- For a sure fire way to clock a throw, get a cheap net and stand behind it.  You will register it every time.  You will also have the most accurate reading
I used this ball with exercise video 4 times.  On the 5th day, my 16 yr old daughter was sitting on it talking on the phone and it exploded, sounded like a tire blowing out and the ball ended up with a two foot piece blown out of it not just a hole.  
Happy Gilmore is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. Then I watched Billy Madison and it was about a totally moronic spoilt rich kid. Total opposites sometimes don't atract.
My son used these socks as part of his football uniform.  He said they were comfortable and I was happy that they withstood the abuse week after week.  The didn't run or snag like some other lighter weight socks
That's basically my two cents. Shallow characters, bizarre story. I am not the kind of person who usually watches romance films, but I do like a good story and heard this was one. It was not. All of the characters were inverted - Ada and her daughter were utterly irritating, George was disgusting from start to finish, and Sam Neill's character (supposedly the heartless jerk) was actually the easiest to sympathize with. How frustrating! ---  --- On a positive note, Michael Nyman's score is unbelievable. I love it
Very useful stopwatch.  I like the mutiple functions. My use is for swim workouts.  This watch allows me to have three intervals going at once.   The print is a little smaller than it appears on the picture.  Not a real problem.  I am glad I bought this stopwatch over my other choice which could only time two lanes. 
If you like unimaginative phony crap you'll love this book.  The proposed animals within this book are utterly stupid and improbable.  An antelope that feels through the snow with its incredibly dumb looking antlers?  A DIURNAL and TERRESTRIAL mammal that for some God-forsaken reason lacks eyes of any kind?  Primates that don't evolve to fit man's niche, but instead take on the roles of otters and flying squirrels?  The thing has got nonsense written all over it.  The "future animals" proposed for this book were not well thought out and somebody, please find Mr. Dixon a liguist, and FAST!  Some of the names he gives these future animals are so stupidly childish that they actually detract from a creature's plausibility.  A vortex? A posset?  What jerk scientist of the future is naming these things?  Can he please be institutionalized?  I admit the pictures were well done and pre-teen children would probably enjoy this immensely.  I know I would've when I was 10 or 11, and there's nothing wrong with that, it's just that Dougal Dixon begins the book in a very advanced scientific way discussing food pryramids, chains of evolution, and ecological niches, but then converts to unscientific baloney around page 30.  All in all, I just don't think it's cut out for people over the age of 12 or so, unless you are just looking for fun and imaginative creatures.  But in that case, why restrict your mind with the laws of evolution?  Why not pick up a copy of the Dungeons and Dragons Monster Manual or something like that with lots of mythological and imaginary creatures?  I find that books intended to showcase the fantastic, do much better outside the realm of (somewhat-boring) science
For $4 it's not bad, but within two weeks the black paint started coming off to reveal the white plastic, looks horrible, but if you don't care how the case looks then this is the case for you
Recently decided to purchase the Treo 750, but after ordering Amazon sends shipping info and it won't arrive for about a month and a half!  I cancelled and went to Cingular and purchased for a lesser price and had it in my hands immediately.  Sad...
My experience using the TracFone has been good. Coverage and connections are not a problem
I had the privilege of attending recitals of many of the 50's and 60's Jazz Legends - before they became household names.  It was truly an honor and a blessing to be part of an era that will never come around again.  I heard brief notes from this CD and I must agree that Mr. Winston did attempt to capture  --- Mr. Guaraldi's timeless expressions, but the this production did not have the same "golden flow" as the original. 
This is still to this day one of the most aweful films i ever saw. I took a girl ona  date for this movie and wow, what a mistake. The movie has no real plot and just gets worse as you watch it more.
My favorite things are often the most simple: A healthy alternative to Kellog's Rice Krispies - with the benefits of organic ingredients, rice syrup instead of cane sugar, and an incredible company behind it all to boot - and this tastes even better! Also, rice syrup won't give you the 'spike' and 'crash' of conventional sugar, and in fact supplies a steady stream of energy
I purchased one (from a local store not Amazon.com), brought it home and printed a photograph that I had previously printed on a Kodak EasyShare printer (my mother-in-law's).  The resulting photograp was horrible, it had a very green tint to it.  I then adjusted the various enhancement controls within the printer, the green tint remained.  I checked the troubleshooting section of the manual, checked/cleaned the print heads, and still the problem remained.  Given that the product is still on the market, I suspect I had a broken unit. ---  --- I did not like the LCD, it is very hard to read.  I adjusted the contrast but it did not help.  [...]
I have had to exchange my Pink Verizon Motorola Razr 3 times!!!!!!  Luckily I purchased the insurance....  I'm going back tomorrow for my 4th phone in 1 yr (this last phone only lasted a few weeks!)... This time I am asking for different phone.  The phone works fine then all of sudden one day, 1/2 the buttons stop working and then when you flip the phone open the "#" is on the screen and you can't get to anything.... No phone numbers, no voicemail, no text messages, nothing!!!! It is extremely frustrating.  What is the point of a cute phone that doesn't work
Along this is not the most exhilirating toy.  However, my son has collected many of the Toy Story Toys and enjoys playing with all of them together.  For any child who does this you need to have Slinky Do
I wanted something thick and soft so my baby couldn't feel the plastic under his sheet. This one is so thin you can almost see through it. There is hardly any quilting. Another down side is you have to take the mattress completly out of the crib to put it on. It is a safe fit, and washes well. I ment to give it 3 stars
I had a chance to read this book cover to cover. All I can say is "absolutely outstanding", short of calling it a historical masterpiece in the field. Very rarely do I encounter an epidemiology or biostatistic textbook that reads so well. It is optimally reader friendly; the author appears to have such a talent in explaining some most sophisticated epidemiological and statistical concepts in such a simplified language. Yet he does not sacrifice the inclusion of some very advanced epidemiological and statistical concepts. New concepts such as causal graphs and instrumental variables are also included and explained beautifully. I strongly recommend this book to all early to intermediate graduate students majoring in Epidemiology. Established epidemiologists may wish to read this book to refresh and update their knowledge. I hope the author writes more textbooks with the same style
I purchase two of the Eva-dry EDV-500 renewable DeHumidifer and hang them inside the closet where I store my photo gears. Although in California is not so humid but little moisture do add up. This dehumidifer is so easy to use -- unwrap it then hang it there. I check them once per several day. When the silica gel change from blue to pick, I just recharge it by plug it into the electric outlet overnight, then next morning, wow, a renewed dehumidifer is ready to use again. The changing of color is very obviously. I strongly recommend this item
These are a favorite in the home. Even though we have all of them, they   are each different and provide hours of entertainment. Skills are learned while solving puzzles some include spatial manipulation of puzzle pieces and roman numerals. Great source of fun and learning. Also a desire to read the actual book and see what is different and the same between book and game
Just received this massager and my wife and I can't stop massaging each other with it. Especially great deal for the special Amazon price. I've been wanting one of these for years because I can hardly feel those little hand held ones (that just fit in the palm of your hand). Glad I splurged. ---  --- Only problem is that Amazon site says "7 heads", Item description says "6 heads", and actul product only included 5 heads. The one missing, from the picture on the box, is the "Acu Point" heads. I'm guessing that's why it's on sale? Still worth it if you get it on sale. Great massager.
I absolutely love Clinique for eye shadow. All of their eye shadows go on so smooth, never crease, and are just the perfect shades of colors for my skin tone. The Almost Peach color is great because I can use it as a highlighter under my brow or just as a base, either way I use it just about every day!  :
This is a very good lock in this price range. The rubber shield on the outside prevents rust and the light on the key fob is useful at night. The only downside is the key. You must make sure to insert the key all the way before turning, otherwise you might bent the key
Its effect very much depends on the climate you live in. If you live in a colder and dry climate, especially during winter it does exactly as it promises - great moisturizer, lines are diminished, as is puffiness. I really love using it - I am 35 and currently living in a cold and dry climate. But in hot and sometims humid climates, or during summer it just doesn't work as well - I don't know why. I like it a lot and this is my 3rd bottle, although I am using it as a seasonal eye care
they do not squeeze my ears and head and the diopters finally let me see well
Watching the Razor release (which I bought to save a few dollars) elevated my blood pressure due to the careless way this rare gem of a movie was treated. Let alone that the terrible translation made me miss the meaning all too many times.  ---  --- Fortunately I was able to find the much-praised version released by ERA of Taiwan from a seller here on Amazon, and it sure did justice both to the film and to the dialog-sheer perfection.
Should you try out the hotel hot tub while on vacation or try the pool instead? This magazine has excellent advice for everything from travel concerns to fitness and beauty advice.  ---  --- Recipes for natural salt scrubs with buttermilk mingle with the hottest advice on commercial beauty products. Do the new stick-on manicures work? What is the newest information on cancer prevention?  ---  --- Dr. Andrew Weil has a 5-minute section with holistic-health advice where he explains why Wild Alaskan salmon and blueberries will keep skin youthful. Is the air in your home as clean as it could be?  ---  --- Fun product pages offer seasonal comforts. For summer you may find yourself looking up beach blankets and fans. Special sections show you how to lose weight, even when on vacation. Interesting advice on how to beat stress and why you should find ways to increase the release of oxytocin.  ---  --- The only thing in the magazine of concern seems to be the advice section which I read, but take some of her advice with a big pinch of salt. If someone thinks they are suffering from an addiction, they probably are. I'm at times rather surprised by her answers that seem to lean towards a casual approach to serious life-changing situations, although she seems to give women great advice about health issues when it comes to making them feel better about breast cancer or work situations.  ---  --- ~The Rebecca Review 
I bought this because a friend had it and it smelled wonderfully of roses.  There must be a quality control problem.  My bottle had no noticible, pleasant sent and therefore did nothing to freshen my hair.  I was only trying to go 1 day without washing.  What a disappointing product and a waste of my money.  :
Bought this for my son.  He loved it and played with it a lot for about a week.  Then the wheels broke.  He wasn't doing anything unusual with the board just riding it back and forth on the driveway.  The wheels seemed to warp and twist making them unstable
it is small and compact, easy for travel but also good for home use
THE TRAILER IS SOOOOOOOOOOO FAKE. IF I JUMPED AROUND IN THESE "MOON SHOES" LIKE THE KIDS IN THE TRAILER ID BE IN THE HOSPITAL BY NOW!!! THESE SHOES HURT YOUR ANKLES SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO BAD AND ARE NOT I REPEAT NOT BOUNCY AT ALL!!!I WAS EXCITED WHEN I GOT THESE BUT VERY DISSAPOINTED WHEN I USED THEM. THEY ARE THE WORST TOY IN THE WORLD. I MEAN COME ON $40.00 FOR THE WORST SHOES IN THE WORLD. WELL THAT MONEY JUST WENT DOWN THE DRAIN!!NEVER, EVER THINK ABOUT BUYING THESE DISASTROUS SHOES FOR YOUR CHILD! AS I TYPE MY FRIEND IS USING THEM AND SHE EVEN SAYS THEY ARE A TOTAL DISASTER TOO!!!!!!!!! NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER EVER EVER EVER BUY THESE SHOES!!! I HATE THEM!!
When converting my 2005 data over to 2006 version it lost all of my time data.  I have to rebuild my datafile just to use the check register now.  Also the new program will not allow me to add a vendor or a customer.  I've had to change names and addresses of obsolete customers and vendors just to add new ones. --- Intuit's support sucks and cannot seem to resolve my problems.  I have two copies on two different computers and am having the same problems with my data file on each computer.  My recommendation is if you are using the 2005 version, and don't need tax tables, don't mess with 2006 version.  It has literally cost me thousands of dollars of my time trying to work out the bugs on my own
Recorded 2001 - 2002. ---  --- It has become all too common that few are taken to task for saying or doing stupid things.  What's worse is that no one seems to care.  ---  --- This is the kind of thing that pisses Lewis Black off. The angrier he gets the funnier he is. ---  --- I first came to appreciate Mr. Black on the Comedy Central's "Daily Show."  I always felt that there should have been more time devoted to Lewis Black. ---  --- I wanted more - I needed more - I had to have more! ---  --- So I went to my "mental health club," Amazon.com and bought every title available. ---  --- The End of the Universe, Rules of Engagement and Luther Burbank Preforming Arts Center Blues - ( I had already purchased the White Album) ---  --- Which one is the best?  ALL OF THEM! ---  --- As I write this review - I realize that I still want more - so I am buying the DVD's. ---  --- There is nothing dated about this material. In 2006 it is just as - if not funnier than when first released. ---  --- Please Lewis keep recording it still is not enough! ---  --- casl
From reading the other reviews, I seem to be one of the few to have mechanical issues with my A530.  Within a month after buying it, the lens cover began remaining half closed when the power is turned on.  I have to manually flick open the shutter/cover.  Then, the flash began intermittently malfunctioning and now the zoom function will only work in one direction (that is, it works to "zoom in" on something, to zoom back out I have to turn the camera off and back on.   To my knowledge, the camera has not been dropped or otherwise physically abused to cause these problems.   --- I'm disappointed because I do like the photos that the camera takes when it does function properly.  --- Fortunately, I bought it at Costco, so it's going back. 
I love the idea of the glasses always being where I can find them. --- The only problem is they need to also be adjustable for how wide         the band is. --- Every time I look up the magnets pop apart. --- If they fix that, I'd give them 5 stars !!
I have ordered Stoneridge Orchards Dried Montmorency Cherries twice.  The cherries have arrived in good condition and taste wonderful
Other reviews have homed in on the frequent nit-picking and general vindictiveness of this book.  I agree with these criticisms, but I'm not going to revisit them here.  The deeper problem lies with the Ayn Rand Institute, which only gives scholarly access to persons guaranteed to toe ARI's party line.  As long as the Ayn Rand Institute refuses full, unconditional scholarly access to Miss Rand's papers, any biographical efforts produced under their aegis will not be taken seriously by anyone who respects proper academic practice.  Nor should they be. 
I've generally been a one-cologne guy -- I had settled into using Acqua di Gio for a number of years, after having used Nautica for a number of years as well. When she got pregnant several months ago, my wife confessed to me that she really didn't like Acqua di Gio (this after two years! Pregnancy does heighten sensitivity to smell, though).  ---  --- I still had some Nautica around, plus the original and no-longer-made Zegna scent from Spain, so I used those for a while. I then bought the newest Zegna cologne, "Z", after my wife smelled it and found it unobjectionable.   ---  --- Well, no sooner had I bought the Z then my wife found a scratch and sniff of Curve in some magazine and said that I really should be using that. The next day we happened to be at K-Mart -- K-MART!!! -- for some household odds and ends, and my wife came across a display of Curve. She insisted on buying it for me.  ---  --- Ever since then, my wife goes nuts when I use it. I don't use it during the week, really -- I'm a somewhat older guy, and it has a sweetish overtone to it that's not very serious -- but whenever I do, my wife always tells me how absolutely wonderful I smell, indeed, how DELICIOUS I smell. Today was casual Friday at work, so I figured, okay. I leave for work very early, before my wife is awake. Sure enough, she calls me at work this morning -- "you used Curve today, didn't you? I can tell because the bathroom smells wonderful!" ---  --- Every woman I know who has commented on it loves it on guys. So it's less expensive and available at K-Mart. And yes it is a little bit sweeter than most colognes I'm personally used to. But it does have a pleasant smell, and if the women love it, well . . . 
So far we have been unable to use this product in the way we want to use it.  We contacted tech support, but after one call, we will be charged $19.95 for each call.  I have been disappointed in the product and the company
I just bought some of this Golden Nut Crunch from Planter's last week and I snack on it at work... it is really one of the best trail mixes I have had before.  I love it.  It lasts a while also.. it lasted me about 4 days at work just snacking on it periodically.  I would definitely recommend this snack.. It's healthy too
The quality and workmanship of this item was very good. I gave it to my grandson for X-mas. It was almost identical to the one his father had at his age. Thanks for a quality product
Orange Pineapple has been my favorite flavor for years. When it's out of stock at my local supermarket, I go out and look for it. ---  --- It's the best
I bought 2 of these drives to set up a RAID1 array (mirror) and one of them continuously has errors, causing the array to be degraded. I called tech support and they said these drives do not support RAID. Big let down, I have to go for the server version which will end up costing much more
they got the texture and the level of sweetness just right.  These were fabulous if a tad bit expensive.  For a special treat I would buy these again
My blood was boiling as I read other customers' rave reviews of "The Prince of Tides."  Whoever considers this thesaurus-scrubbing, self-indulgent mess of cliches a literary masterpiece has no sense of language and literature.  Someone was even audacious enough to compare Pat Conroy to Virginia Woolf.  What a joke!  Woolf's writing is brilliant, original, and real.  She cuts to the quick, whereas Conroy slathers his story in cloying metaphors and trite descriptions.  One can almost see Conroy congratulating himself on each simile and metaphor as he writes, not caring how superfluous or artificial his language is -- nor how unrealistic it makes the story.  I laughed out loud at some of the words he puts in the characters' mouths.  In the real world, nobody is as self-concious and self-reflexive as the characters in this book.  They do not speak in reams of figurative language.  I cannot even get into how inconsistent and impossible the characters are, especially the children.  Also, Conroy caricatures both places and exaggerates the cultural gulf between them.  (I make that claim as a Southerner who lived in NYC for four years.)  It's one of many, many flaws in this ridiculous book.  Read it if you like sensational stories with mass appeal (John Irving, etc.), but avoid it if you have any respect for the English language and for real American literature (Cheever, Plath, Hemingway, Cather, etc.).  Don't be fooled by all the fools out there. 
I've had one for a year, and love it.  I bought a second one as a gift.  They are so much more convinient than a mony clip or wallet
I just received a first-time correspondence from Kids Discover threatening referral to a credit agency for copies of a magazine that we didn't order and haven't received.  There is no telephone number to call and only a p.o. box to correspond with.  I suspect many people just pay the bill in order to avoid any trouble.  I sent a notice to the Consomer Complaint agency in the states involved in order to get this fraud on record
We have the 49MHz Whisper Connect and love it (see our review of that one). We needed a second monitor to replace a 900MHz Fisher Price monitor that is 4+ years old, and decided to try this one out. We set the base across the room from our daughter and had her talk at her normal voice, and we could barely hear here with the volume turned up. We thought we must have a defective unit, so we returned it and got another, and we had the same problem. There is no interference or static with the monitor - but also no sound. We're very unhappy with it and would not recommend it
we love the accessories this item comes with but the doll itself is... we have mixed feelings about her.  my daughter, 4, loves her hair because it's so different from all her other barbies, but she hates her feet.  her feet are way too big, even bigger than ken's (my daughter tried making her wear ken's shoes but it didn't work).  another thing we love and hate about her is that her hands can move like pregnant midge (good), and she has a bigger body than most barbie dolls (bad because she can't use the other doll's clothes)
I got this Zafu(meditation cushion.) It is round in shape and too  high and bulky to be comfortable to sit on, around 9 inches high and 15-18 inches in diameter. It is also pretty heavy, around 4 pounds due to the sheer size. ---  --- I could not sit comfortably on it due to this reason returned it. I would recommend trying it somewhere before buying. ---  --- The filling seemed of good quality
Not the manufacturer's fault, I blame U.S. Congress for this.... ---  --- The clock has an internal chip which did not recognize the earlier DST change this year.  There was going to be such a long delay before being able to get a replacement chip and/or clock that we just returned the clocks.  Disappointed
I recommend this cd to anyone stuck in a rut like I was.  Listening to the same artists over and over but wanting something new and fresh.  Life on Planet Groove will be a welcome addition to your collection.  Great for the drive
I bought 2 sleepers.  sleeper had holes in the arm pit area and the other sleeper had a whole where the neck trim should of been sewed on. A real waste of my money
... which makes the wrench completely useless.  I'll have to buy another wrench elsewhere from a vendor that supplies the bits.  Also, the wooden handles have splinters and are extremely cheaply made.  Do not buy this product
I've had these clippers for a little over a month now and they are by far the worst pair of clippers i have ever owned.  I have short hair and cut my hair myself twice a week.  The length adjuster on the side of the clippers doesn't hold.  If the clippers are positioned all the way up all it takes is a little pressure and the blade goes all the way down.  Tightening the screw didn't help either.  The attachments don't fit right, especially the blend attachment.  This attachment can only be used if you don't mind the feeling of having the hair ripped out of your head because all it does is pull.  The only good thing about these clippers is that its cordless but whats the point if the clippers suck
I have seen many other winders in the market with the same features but with much higher prices.  This winder is so quiet that I have no problem sleeping even with it on.  I highly recommend it
The animation ... Excellent.  The characters ... Excellent.  The premise ... Excellent.  Laugh lines ... plenty of them and well executed. ---  --- This is a movie you will say was worth spending your money on. ---  --- THE PROBLEM IS ... as adults you will understand the movie is about putting the past to rest so you are free to enjoy your now and your future. ---  --- For kids, they don't see a lesson in putting your past to rest, they see - If you don't like something - put IT to rest ... as is R.I.P. - DEAD! ---  --- After the crotchety old man (doesn't every haunted house need one to heighten the tension) identifies the haunting is related to someone he knows ... there is far too personal a vendetta to finish them off (again). ---  --- Also shame on the producers of this movie... a KIDS movie ... there is far too much irresponsible adult behaviour (babysitter getting it on with boyfriend, boyfriend getting drunk and threatening the kids, etc) -- it is just not necessary to tell this story.  ---  --- I wouldn't let any relative of mine, under 14, see this otherwise excellent flick
Another Castlevania game means more excitement.  Going around whipping everything in sight never gets boring because the gameplay of Castlevania has been an interesting one for many, many years. ---  --- I love the graphics.  They are truly something magnificent.  The special effects from all the enemies is really a nice, welcoming touch.  Just the overall atmosphere of the game is dark and spooky, the way a Castlevania game should be. ---  --- This game follows the formula that was featured in Symphony of the Night, which means if you like the Metroid style of gaming, you will love this game as well
Bought this for my boyfriend, and I can't stop smelling him because it's unlike any other cologne I've ever come upon.  It's so intriguing that I find myself sniffing him just to get another whiff of it.  I can best describe it as a soft-suede with hints of amber, vanilla, and wood. It smells better after it's been on the skin for a while.  It does  have a slight feminine scent, however, this makes me like it more, and makes me want HIM to wear it more.  It's definetely for a confident man
The 2nd day I shampoo-d with this bar, it was amazing the compliments I received. It made my hair right after going to the salon shiny. I'd highly reccomend this to anyone
Zadie Smith is one of the most powerful authors I have read in recent times. She is so subtle about the race factor that we don't get to find out the races of the protagonists till the first 50 pages or so. She has also captured the emotions of Kiki and Zora perfectly (why is it that women always stand out in emotional moments!) and the characters stay with you even after you put the book down. ---  --- If you enjoyed the movie "Crash", you will love this one
My husband brought this game home and I thought, "Oh no, I guess we're not having multisyllable conversations for the next few weeks..." But to my surprise not only did he ABSOLUTELY love this game but I would sit next to him and watch, totally transfixed by the amazing detail and effort that the creators poured into this game. I caught myself saying, "Baby, aren't you going to play your game?" This game is incredible and while I am not at all a gamer I'm tempted to try it out! Everyone not shocked by gore (and I mean LOTS of gore) should play this game. Every game should be this well made.
Where Macworld is bad, Addict is dreadful. It is dumbed down to the level of Teen Beat, and the "reviews" don't deserve the name. The extent to which it drools over Apple is embarassing, leaving no pretence of independence. Like its competitor, it exploits the crummy support that typifies the computer industry, so we get articles about the "secrets" of such and such product. A "secret" in the computer industry is a feature or defect that has not been properly documented by the manufacturer. This should be blasted, not applauded. But Addict is happy to exploit readers by selling them the information they should have gotten when they purchased the product
Swarovski has been making crystal jewelry since 1892, and their consistent quality has kept the company going through wars and the rise and fall of empires. These excellent earrings are made of sterling silver and Swarovski crystals, and are quite attractive. If you are looking for some nice, crystal and silver earrings, then these are the ones to get.  ---  --- By the way, they look great when combined with the Heart, Star and Starburst crystal tattoos - which I also highly recommend!
This product just doesn't have much variety.  My baby's both are completely bored in it, and have only used it a handful of times.  They are 5 months and 1 year.  She like noise makers and squishy toys, but these are all hard, boring toys ... at least to my kids
such a kiddie classic..so cute im 22 and had to have this because i loved it as a ki
Our daughter is turning 2 years old this week and I felt it time to finally write a review of this amazing product.  From the very beginning, she has been an incredibly alert and interested baby.  She was born c-section at 38 weeks with eyes and hands wide open.  Once they were finished cleaning her up, my husband and I were thrilled to just cuddle her and talk to her while she looked at us both with wide eyes and made little coo coo sounds.  Right away she was great at nursing with a very good latch.  She rarely ever cried, and when she did, it was a quiet little "lay lay lay" sound, not the wild Waa-waa's.   ---  --- Throughout infancy she was always capable of adapting to every situation quickly and without emotional outburst.  Where it would seem other children would be over-stimulated in an environment, she would thrive and seem to want more stimulation!  At only three months of age, people thought she was older because of her alertness and interest in people and animals.  She hit every developmental milestone months early, especially in language (sign and speech), music appreciation, and colors/shape/letter/number recognition.  Her pediatrician has been happily surprised by her and suggested that I should have five more just like her!  ---  --- When we bought the BabyPlus, we thought, "if it helps only 10% as well as the testimonials say it does, it will be worth it".  We're certain it has contributed positively in helping develop this little miracle of ours.  We're now expecting child #2 (25 weeks along) and although not using the Baby Plus could be an interesting experiment (same gene pool, same parenting, etc.), we're too interested in the possibilities of how much it may contribute to our next child for us to withhold it. ---  ---  ---  ---  
I was anxious to get this game for my daughter for Christmas, as she loves all princess things.  Unfortunately, the instructions were so confusing (do they even test these games?  with real people?), we quickly grew disenchanted with it, and tossed it.  Quality is not top notch, and the instructions and actual game concept are poorly thought out
The goal arrived at my house assembled wrong, then after it was fixed be me, I successfully put it together, which was relativly easy.  After several moderately hard training sessions two large holes were in the net.  That is on top of the fact that the pins that hold the net together are weak.  The weakness in the pins causes the goal to collapse if there is a shot off of the post.  Overall, this is probably not a good buy.
I suggest watching the original version: Sword of Doom - which is amazing. A lot less acid is involved, and less cliche. Izo is a rent, at best
My hair tends to fall out due to me not eating enough protein, so NEW! (Hair) is a lifesaver.  As others have said, it lathers like you wouldn't believe -- you really only need to roll it in your hands two or three times to get enough for a thick lather -- and it has an amazing scent.  (Sniffing the bar can actually be a bit addictive...you can smell it really strongly even before you open the box!)  I've found that keeping it in a small lightly covered dish in my bedroom, away from the moisture of the bathroom, is the best way to preserve it for a while.  (Also, it works as an accidental room freshener -- seriously, the smell is incredible!) ---  --- My only wish is that the scent would last a little longer in my hair, since it doesn't really stick, even right after showering, unless I use a lot of lather, and that ends up being expensive since then the bar doesn't last as long.  Most of the time, there isn't even much of a hint, whereas other Lush shampoos can make your hair smell wonderful, even a bit overpowering, for days. ---  --- Also, unlike some of the other Lush products, it leaves my hair fairly flat.  It's true that it helps with making hair really soft and shiny, but it seems to have the opposite effect when it comes to volume, and that's not so good when you're already having some hair loss.  Using a mostly scent-free conditioner after is almsot necessary, at least in my experience. ---  --- I think NEW! (Hair) is a terrific shampoo for its hair-restoring qualities and general sniffability, but at the same time, it could be a little better with its more cosmetic qualities.  Buy it more for the former than the latter if you want the most enjoyment and value out of it.  And if you do have hair loss, trust me -- the price is worth it
This novel comes off like a high schooler wanting to write about the movie and music industries.  In between the entertainment biz cliches, the author can only think to put various assination hits.  some of the characters are interesting but not believable, and they  certainly can't make up for the braindead plot.  Read some of his other novels and skip this one
I have had my fare share of yoga mats and this one rates as one of the best. The thickness (1/8 inch) is just perfect - not too thick so it's easily portable but thick enough to provide adequate cushioning. What I really like about this mat is that it has the right amount of stickiness and grip, in a word, it is comfortable.  --- 
When I received this DVD, I played it on my iMac. When doing this, I discovered that there were Chinese characters showing at the top of the screen. The quality of the DVD images were dark and grainy. I reported to Amazon that they had unknowlngly sold me a pirated DVD, and I was saddened to not have a response from Amazon other than refunding my costs. Copyright is not only a law to protect publishers; it also protects consumers from getting poor quality products. I feel that I can no longer depend on Amazon to provide my DVD orders.
I'm very pleased with this tea.   ---  --- I boil a pot of water and then take the lid off and let it cool to the right temperature, which is around 200 degrees Fahrenheit.  I let it steep for about five minutes and then remove my infuser and pour myself a cuppa nice, light oolong.  It's good and relaxing. ---  --- Arrived in the container seen in the picture, with the tea sealed up in a little plastic bag inside of it.  I'd recommend it
This game is ok, entertains my children for a little while.  I thought everything was ok, but then, after only a couple of months, the cartridges started to malfunction!  We have two leap pads and some games work in one, but not the other (and visa versa!)  For the price, I don't want the toy to not work 1/2 the time after only a few uses.  The books seem to hold up pretty good, but the cartridges don't.  And, at a price of around $12 each, I was very dissapointed.  If the cartridges worked all the time, I would probably give this toy 4 stars, as it is fun (when it works) and portable.  One last comment for improvement, would be to have the volume be on the outside, not in the book, as the regular volume is a bit too loud and I have to ask my little one to turn it down each time she switches books/cartridges
I love this magazine and I look forward to getting it in the mail every single week, unless if the last one was a double issue. Then I have to wait another whole week, which can sometimes be painful. I love the reviews and the magazine is funny, fresh and it keeps me up to date on movies, TV, music, and DVDs. The onlt complaint I have is lately they don't have as many reviews for urban releases
IF YOU PURCHASE THIS SLIPPER FOR YOUR MAN, HE WILL LOVE YOU FOREVER.  THEY NOT ONLY LOOK GREAT AND VERY EXPENSIVE, THEY ARE SUPER COMFORTABLE AND HE ABSOLUTELY LOVES WEARING THEM.  THEY LOOK GOOD ENOUGH TO WEAR TO THE SUPERMARKET.  BARBRA WILLI
This gun is absolutley terrible. The third time I shot it, the thing broke!The pellets it came with were not even perfect circles and you could not load them. I would tell you more of how bad this was but I really don't want to waste any more of my time
This is the best of the LeapPad books I have seen.  My four-year old has spent hours on it.  It's very interactive and covers a lot of ground for that age. Highly recommended
if you love dancehall this movie has a bit of a surprise for you. ninjaman, elephantman, nitty kutchie, boom dandemite, harry toddler, and cutty ranks all have roles in this movie; which is a cop versus gun dealer type flick. the dvd is full screen and shot in cheap video format, but it still shines despite these flaws. the soundtrack is very good despite containing no tracks from the aforementioned artists. i wonder if this is what ninjaman has been doing lately, because he does have quite a substantial role in this flick, and doesn't do bad at all at the acting thing...
I was disappointed in this video.  I came to it not as a devout Catholic but as a fan of travel videos.  In other words, I watched this video with the same motivation I would have to watch Shackleton's Antarctic exploration, or something from the Globe Trekker series. ---  --- With that in mind, the target audience for this video is not me.  It is the religious Catholic.  Therefore, from my perspective, I can't recommend it.  I'm not one for all the pomp and circumstance of religion.  I don't enjoy worshipping the "Holy Father", or watching the construction of the clownish uniform of the Swiss Guard. ---  --- If you are a devout Catholic you will probably enjoy this video.  If you are not, and just came to the video because you wanted a Globe Trekker style tour of the Vatican, you are likely to be disappointed. ---  --- And that is what these reviews are for - to let you know whether you will enjoy the video or not
This is a rather scary look at what could be a possible future if things continue the way they are heading. Our food supplies becoming more depleted due to unfavorable growing conditions, climatic extremes, lack of water and nutrient-poor land as well as overpopulation continuing at an uncontrollable and alarming rate.  This type of recycling may become a necessity.  Hopefully, it would at least be voluntary as the movie depicts.  An eye-opener for sure
This game, while simple in it's storyline shows us the depth and power of Disney matched with Square/Enix.  First Square and Enix merge, effectively bringing together the makers of two of the largest RPG's of all time (Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy).  Now, we have the perfect pairing of wit, humor, heart and pure Square story.  Based in many of the worlds from Disney Legends, your character Sora is a superb study in dynamic role playing.  The chains you can get going in Sora's attacks are amazing.  The extra battles in the sky over London and in the Hercules Arena are outstanding.  To learn this battle style, you must have wits of steel and thumbs of Orchaleum.   ---  --- The battle against Sephiroth, one of the best known villians from the Final Fantasy series is awesome.  I never did beat Sephiroth but the battle was intense and I had him beaten to his knees several times. ---  --- The bottom line is the sequel will be amazing as it revisits many of the same worlds and reinvents itself.  This game essentially creates a new genre, blending a soulful cast with characters from Disney lore.  The underpinning story is not to be missed, be sure you get the extended ending by following the Brady Games guide.   ---  --- The summons are a bit hard to leverage but Tinker Bell comes in handy in some of the tougher battles.  360 degree rotating battles with the Shadow King in the sky above London and the final villian will thrill and captivate audiences of all ages.  The secrets hidden in the game are rightly difficult to find and awe inspiring in their execution.
I purchased the Crocs Butter thinking it would be something special just for Crocs shoes.  As soon as I opened the package, I noticed the Crocs Butter is just like any other shoe buffer/cleaner with the black sponge.  I already own two shoe buffers, one of which I received free with purchase from a local shoe store.  Needless to say, I returned the Crocs Butter, since it's not worth $4.95, plus $10 shipping, which I was not refunded.  What a crock
I've been down for Monica since the beginning; but now I am FINISHED, I love Monica's voice, but whats up with all these singers wanting to be rappers...WTF!!! I want the soulfoul Monica from the first CD, "Sideline Ho" ARE YOU SERIOUS!!! again WTF!! Could someone please come out with a soulful mature CD, cause this one aint even close.
I guess the reason I enjoyed the movie so much was because I went into the theatre expecting a good drama. And that's exactly what I got. The story was very interesting to me. I enjoyed the relationships between the villagers, especially Lucious and Ivy. ---  --- The scary moments just added to the drama. Having grown up in the country, I know how scary the woods can be. I loved all the twists to the story. ---  --- The only thing I didn't like was William Hurt's performance. It was too hammy. I think if this critical role had been cast by another actor, the movie would've moved along at a better pace. ---  --- But still a great movie
I purchased this remote control to make watching DVD's on the PS2 easier.  I had problems getting it to work consistantly right out of the box.  I had to press most of the buttons very hard to get them to work.  I hoped it would get better but it only got worse.  I am now back to using the game controler and threw the remote control away. ---  --- I would NEVER recommend this product. 
I love these cookies too!  They're crunchy animal cookies with a lemony coating that doesn't feel waxy in your mouth.  The lemon taste is great and they're not too sweet.  They're a perfect afternoon snack when you want a sweet treat but don't want to overdo it with calories or sugar.  The box is a little skimpy on the number of cookies you get, but the taste is worth it
The hide n seek care bear really wasn't all it was made out to be. My kids played with it, with my husband, on Christmas, and they all gave up after 5 minutes. It was giving out wrong directions, and just wasn't really a good substitute for a game of hide and seek. So my girls forgot about the remote control and play with the doll like it's an ordinary stuffed animal--an rather expensive stuffed animal
One of my former roommates used to have Kerastase Nutritive Shampoo for very dry hair.  I remember it smelling great and being endorsed by celebrities as the "it" shampoo for treating dry, unruly tresses. The other day, I saw this shampoo on the clearance shelf at Meijers and regrettably made an impulse purchase.  Even at clearance price, this shampoo was still expensive.  ---  --- I have very thick, wavy, and somewhat dry hair that needs lots of conditioning products--when I checked out the ingredients (after I bought the shampoo), I groaned inwardly. Almost all of the ingredients (with the exception of water) is on the Aubrey Organics' "ingredients to be avoided" list (that is, they are considered toxic).  Like Aubrey Organics, other reputable natural beauty manufacturers suggest avoiding parabens as preservatives because they are mildly estrogenic and can be absorbed through the skin. This shampoo has six different types of parabens--methyl, ethyl, propyl, etc.      ---  --- If a product has such a steep asking price, then you would think that its manufacturers would put forth a better formula, incorporating non-toxic, natural ingredients (like Aveda, Biolage, and Biosilk).  At least Suave and V05 (bargain-priced shampoos) can boast about having vitamins and silk amino acids in their formulas (though many of their other ingredients are also found on the "to be avoided" list). 
This is a very flexible and capable camera. If you are looking for more than a point & shoot will offer, there are very few that would compare. For me the deciding factor was the high quality lieca lens with wide angle, if you havent compared this directly with a conventianal lens you will be amazed at what youve been missing. the 16:9 is an ok feature if you plan on HDTV veiwing but the screen size is compromised when you switch to 4:3. i would prefer a larger screen and lose the 16:9 feature. the lens cap is a little annoying as well but those issues aside, i am very satisfied
This thing took about 6 hours to build.  The directions are terrible and extremely difficult to follow, but I figured it was worth it because it just looks so cool.  Unfortunately after completely assembling the thing and flipping the switch the motor, on fresh batteries, didn't have enough power to lift the ball the almost 6 feet consistently.  We spent as much time trying to get the motor to do what it was supposed to as we did building it.  Ours also came with a special ball that had a skateboarder inside.  He looks really cool, but the motor never was able to lift him more than about a foot.  I love KNEX, but this set is a DUD
I am very excited about the additions to Toast 8.  I am still learning how to use all of them.  The connection with TiVo is one of the most exciting new items.  I have connected and reviewed Tivo recordings through Toast.  I have not had an opportunity to use toast for a DVD yet. 
I support the comments that others make: this game is so poorly designed, it is laughable. I cannot imagine that the designers or writers even sat down to play the game once.  Forget trying to follow the directions; they left out many important rules.  The board doesn't work, especially the way the pieces fit into it, and what a terrible ending with a spinner that doesn't even work like a spinner.  What is up with that?  Forget this game
My son received this as a gift when he was 15 months old--He was already much too tall for the toy!  The box advertizes height adjustment, which simply allows you to lift it up about a half an inch.  However, even if he were smaller, the base does not even come close to providing the necessary stability to stand up to even a soft swing!  My son was amused by the lights and sounds for a brief period of time, but quickly lost complete interest in the toy. 
These birdie hose reels are such a nice addition to my yard.  I bought two packs and have lined my front garden with them.  They are a very nice heavy weight and the overall detail is much more then I expected especially for this price.   I agree the stakes could have been an inch longer however I am having NO issues with the size of my hose fitting into the track.  I am not sure what size hose the other customer is using.  It must be a professional grade hose. ---  --- Ready for Spring! 
Nothing at all like boy-band CDs (InSync, Backstreet Boys, etc like editorial compared it to).  While some of the songs are over-processed and don't allow Clay's strong, clear, and beautiful voice to shine through enough, it is overall a very good CD. It has some catchy tunes on it.  His second CD, Merry Christmas With Love, allows his wonderful voice to shine through even more
This product arrived with none of the hardware needed to assemble. The table itself looked as if was used or returned for being substandard. All in all, not a good experience. I will not purchase anything from this seller agai
While "Scary Movie 4" does work in getting out a couple of laughs, it certainly does not live up to the past three.  Many of the jokes that were used are redundant and frankly, are getting pretty old.  Although this movie had a lot of different material to work with such as The Grudge, Saw, and War of the Worlds, it misses the funny mark just by a bit.  Personally, I felt they could have done a LOT more in terms of parodying these films, particularily with The Grudge.  The writers should have taken more advantage of the content they had to spoof in order to have made this film a lot more funnier.  And really, was it necessary to spoof films such as Brokeback Mountain and Millionaire Dollar Baby, both of which are not horror films? ---  --- I believe the comedy in this film is aimed towards a more mature audience, and is vastly different from what Scary Movies 1 & 2 offered (which I found to be extremely hilarious).  If you're looking for over the top funny, look towards the other Scary Movies
We've gone through about 2 or 3 generations of infusion basketballs from spalding.  The gimmick isn't worth it and there are better balls like the original zi/o and the excel for outdoor and the TF1000 for indoor
Perhaps it was just my microwave, or cooking it too long, but the two different types of this soup I have tried (Chicken with noodles, and chicken with rice) have both left a nasty metallic taste in my mouth that is very hard to get rid of. ---  --- I would have thrown it out, except it was the only thing I brought for lunch.  I do NOT recommend this soup
Singer had the best male body, bar none, I have ever seen in films and *it* is really the star of this one, right behind the two ferrets, "Beastmaster's" friends. Most of the camera angles enhance Singer's musculature. He has learned how to stand and move to best advantage for the cameras. He's not handsome, though, which doesn't really matter in this film. ---  --- The film is fun, action-packed and pretty to watch. While Tanya Roberts in her rather small role is nice to look at, she cannot act her way out of a paper bag, but manages to lend another perfect body to the cast. ---  --- Rip Torn, the evil one, barely suppresses a guffaw at the lines he has to say, but pulls it off nonetheless. The plot is good - "Beastmaster" (Singer) is ripped from his mother's womb before birth, placed by occult means into the womb of an ox (cow?) and is then ripped out again at knifepoint. As a result, somehow he is able to communicate nonverbally with animals and they are his helpers - an eagle, a black leopard and two ferrets - on his way to avenge his mother's death. ---  --- For what it is (bad acting, beautiful people and an unusual plot), it deserves the cult following it's got. After all, cult movies don't always become so by being great works of art. Buy it just for fun, suspend your incredulity for an evening and just enjoy it
I am ordering copies for all 23 middle school principals and the two assistant principals leading two middle school programs in the Milwaukee Public Schools system. We will use Wheatley's book as the primary resource  for our professional growth at our MPS Middle School Principals  Collaborative institute August 9-11, 1999. We are not just concerned with  reform; we seek renewal as well. Wheatley provides the basis. She notes  that Einstein said that  a problem cannot be solved from the same  consciousness that created it. The entire book is a marvelous exploration  of this philosophy
This camcorder is only good for outdoor recording. In indoor recording or recording in little bit low light, picture quality is very bad. I tried to record in my living room where I have two 100 watt bulbs but recorded picture was very blurred. In outdoor recording in a sunny day, picture quality is quite good with sharp colors. Zoom works well
recipient was very satisfied with this blanket as PB are his initials
Baby is happy, eating well.  What better praise for a bottle nipple can be given?  Note: Fast flow is for age six months and up, the slow/medium flow nipples by Avent are just as good (just for younger babies
I am using the product for my Charbroil Grill Caddy.  It is a decent fit.  However, with the colder weather the material has become more stiff.  We'll have to see how it weathers over the cold months
I love Market Spice tea and wish that it was something I could buy locally.  The only downside is a short shelf life, but I keep it in the refrigerator and voila! I enjoy a daily cup of tea
This is a terrible suite. ---  --- Read the fine print very carefully:  It will not work on RAID configurations of any kind.  It will tell you that in the install (thanks a lot...kinda late?) ---  --- I found its support on recovery disc of USB hardware unstable. ---  --- This is a very unstable, even errant, set of programs.  It also tries to take over a lot of system elements
This is a great item for any collector or new fans to the X-men. All the older along with the newer issues look great. The CD includes all issues of the Uncanny X-men (1-461) along with Giant Sized and annual issues. There is also comprehensive biographies on the more popular characters and artwork and layouts of the Xaiver Institute. Could it of had more content, maybe, but this will keep one busy for a long time. With easy maneuverabiltity, this is a highly addictive CD with virtually months of entertainment
I was assigned this book for a college course and was greatly surprised at its quality.  Blamires had C.S. Lewis as a tutor, and I've read some of Lewis's writings and have found them to be above average but not particularly special (many people do find his works special of course).  Blamires, on the other hand, I find to be very unique - his book is top quality and very helpful.  I'm surprised this isn't a very popular book, as it ought to be. ---  --- I have only two complaints, both of which are purely stylistic.  First, the edition I have looks like it's a copy of an earlier edition, which makes the text hard to read (I got used to it after a while though).  Some publisher should take it upon themself to retype this book and republish it.  My second criticism is something that can't be avoided - the book was originally written in the early sixties, so a lot of the examples are dated (i.e. references to WWII, which was still in memory, also out-of-date terms like "jive", etc.).  However, just a few of the examples are affected by this.  The book as a whole could be reasonably passed off today as a recent work, since so much Blamires's criticism of the Christian mind (or lack thereof) still (sadly) applies. ---  --- However, the Christian mind today is being rediscovered, and the march of atheism is on the decline, with the march of religion in general on the rise.  Even though things are looking up, Christians should keep Blamires's book in mind - not to get too comfortable with this (secular) world, for our real home is beyond bodily death.  That we ought to have a supernatural orientation is basically the theme and summary of this book. ---  --- Superb book, and I really recommend this to anyone.  This is definitely recommended for Christians, and also for any non-Christian who are curious and want to take a look at some of the problems Christians have today
My daughter wanted this for Christmas more than anything.  But the doll is very difficult to use.  Suzie has these sudden shutdowns where she turns off for no apparent reason.  Then suddenly she'll come back to life later.  She "grows" almost instantly.  Despite my best efforts to try and protect the grow button.  I reset her constantly.  Getting her to do all of the fun "big girl" things she is suppossed to do  is frustrating for my five year old.  Essentially, I have spent more time fiddling with Suzie than my daughter has spent playing with her.  And the face paint came off almost immediately.  Even with the small amount of time that she has been working.  Perhaps when my daugter is a little older, she can spend time fiddling with her.  She does play with her as just a "baby doll" so it hasn't been a total waste.  But I certainly didn't need to spend the extra money for all of the electronics that don't work.  Oh, and sometimes I'll walk into my daughters room and she'll suddenly "wake up" and start saying MaMa.  Very horror movieish. 
Being a PC user for many years (since 1985)I have come through all the versions of MS operating systems (does anyone out there remember 3.5!) MS has also piggy backed this "robust" office product for 20 years.  Their upgrades are seldom anything more than a better looking toolbar.  This is no exception, but this time I like the tool bar!  As to ease of use, I use PowerPoint and Word often and my spouse uses Excel.  If there were an easier product available we would buy it but then Windows XP would kill it on sight and Vista would stop working altogether.  Why does MS think that everyone but those working in a professional since (hence Office for Professionals) needs all the junk they subject us to?  Do those guys in Redmond still think adult users of the PC like "cute" things like little doggies wagging their tail or a friendly paper clip to help you answer your every question!  I am tired of Beta testing MS products for so many years but as a PC user I am stuck with them and until someone else can come up with a better system, other than Mac, we are all stuck with them. 
I recommend NOT to purchase this item.  Look for another one. --- The lens itself seems ok, although I can't really say, but the adapter which is built in to the lens is shoddy and cumbersome and ruins the the whole deal.  The adapter is a quick release type where one end attaches to the camera and the lens simply snaps in, or is quickly released.  This would be great, except for two very important things.  One, the lens fits very loosely in the quick release adapter. This causes some MAJOR distortion, especially when moving.  Two, the housing is made of thin plastic which does not seem very durable.  In fact it is so cheaply thin that I am afraid to leave it in my car because the heat may distort the plastic. One drop, even a small one, and it is done for
The ordering, speed of delivery were great, but there was one huge problem which ruined all the good points.  The wrong movie was delivered.  I ordered Honeymoon in Vegas and received Leaving Las Vegas.  And it was too late to return the movie and receive the replacement in time for Christmas.  So that was bad
I am a HUGE ATL Fan. Black Mafia 4 Life, know what I mean. I waited a long time for this release, and it was painful to listen to. It just seemed to lack direction. It might be said that this album (an independent record label) was so bad, that it ended their careers. Too bad, I loved ATL.
I've tried a few types of vegan chocolate chip cookies and was always disappointed with how bland they were--and loaded with fat and calories.  These are not only the least amount of calories that I've seen for a vegan cookie of this size, but I found that these double chocolate chip cookies were better than the non-vegan ones I've had in the past!  They are so, so, so good.  Whoever said that you need dairy and eggs in chocolate?  I have my omnivore friends and family try these cookies to show them that I am FAR from deprived!  Two thumbs up and highly recommended from this vegan chocoholic
I feel duped! I bought Spy Sweeper at the computer store a year ago. It was the 2.6 version. At first everything was great. I got my definitions, it found traces, it detected spy cookies. When I ran the definition update, I had no problem with the firewall. Every time they said upgrade, I did. Then I started getting renew e-mail. I had months to go and they sent me renewal e-mails sometimes two or three a week and I ignored them, not only because I knew the year wasn't up, but I also was suspicious that it was just another spammer out to get my credit card information. I e-mailed them asking if their renew mails were really from them, voicing my concerns. I got ignored, to when I eventually got to speak to someone, they didn't even know what their renewal e-mail looked like! The problems began when I updated the latest version which is the 4.5. When I would try to update my definitions I'd get a warning that there's was a problem and contact webroot, while it had no problem noting that I had the latest version updates. No settings were changed, not even my firewall which was blamed by them. I think it's them not me since now it's suddenly happening. They refuse to address it. Then I checked their site about my subscritpion. I knew I had one because I bought it at the store, my subscription doesn't expire until June and if I was invalid I doubt I could upgrade to newer versions. What did their page say? No subscription! When I wrote I never got a straight answer about it. Then I was told that the program was corrupted, download a new copy of the latest version from their site. I did. What did I get? Boxes that said subscription not activated. They knew I had one and they won't change it on their site or give me explanations. After pestering does my latest version now say when I expire. I've asked why it goes online to scan when it doesn't need to and I get ignored. So I decided to call but wasn't sure how because I'm in a different time zone. It took several days for them to get back to me by e-mail saying that their Mountain Time is treated like my Eastern time to get a hold of someone. The first person I spoke to after four tries at 15-20 rings each, was nasty, especially when I told him to slow down because he mumbled. I downloaded what he told me to do, he said nothing about the firewall issue despite him telling me he read my tickets about it.The second person sounded like he'd smoked one too many joints after he decided to answer the phone after 15 rings. He didn't know how to answer any of my firewall questions or why their page kept saying I had no subscription when the program in it's latest version finally admitted I'm current after pestering.  They don't give you straight e-mail answers. They don't answer their phones hoping that after the 15th ring you'll give up. It won't scan everything even when no other programs are running. In the new version it found a spy cookie, it kept repeating the same one over and over despite my checking it as "always remove".Never did that with the previous versions. I don't like a company who answers questions selectively. I don't like a company who makes you wait 20 rings. I don't like a company who blames your computer settings when they never affected the previous versions. Webroot's Spy Sweeper will be replaced in my desperate search to find a spyware program that actually works, and whose staff answers my questions and not mislead me about my subscription status
I don't know, but.. I couldn't get myself to swallow it. It made me, literally, vomit. I wish I just ordered Power Bar's Vanilla-Yoghurt flavored one, which tastes fantastic and I love so very much. ---  --- Anyway, probably it's just me but, it really really makes me sick.. I thought I would taste something new but oh well..
I'm just starting to become a true fan of Pigpen.  Earlier, I just didn't get him and I would constantly skip forward to more of the GD extended jams.  Lately, I've started to get what he was all about and what made him such an important part of the early dead shows.  I'm glad I picked up this set.   --- It's Pigpen's night and we should all be happy for this nice memory.  Pick it up. ---  --- Note: the rest of the band has some fine moments too!!
Season four is excellent, can't wait for the release of season five
My wife shopped around at Amazon looking for her grandmother's 88th b-day (coming up soon) and came across handmade hadong silk scarf.  Every silk scarf she came across she would say, "What a beautiful and gorgeous hadong silk scarfs they are."  Before she found Vietmade Silk Scarfs at Amazon, she had looked online stores at Macy's, Nordstorm, JcPennies, but couldn't really compare with the ones Vietmade made.  I agree with my wife when she said, "This place uses good quality silk materials and has a great prices!!"  When we got the scarf today 4/10/07 (ordered 4/4/07) and opened it to see what the silk scarf looked like in person .. my wife wished that she had ordered one for herself, one for my mother and one more for our sister in-law.  My wife and I definately recommend this place and we'll buy a few more hadong silk scarfs in near future.  Also, delivery was on schedule, good packaging and love the scarfs!
I bought this watch for my husband for his bday. It was a great bargain, very stylish, and he loves it. The only problem we encountered was w/ the so-called "smart link" band.  It was supposedly designed for the customer to resize the band at home, but after numerous failed attempts, we gave up. We Googled it and found several people who encountered similar problems solving the smart link mystery but no one offered a solution. Even the Fossil website was no help. We ended up paying a jeweler who sells Fossil watches $10 to resize the band.  Other than that, my husband is very satisfied with this watch.
I used to love these bottles until the nipple collapsed twice while feeding my 4 month old daughter, causing almost the entire bottle to spill in her mouth and nose.  The first time it happened I thought I didn't screw the top on, but then it happened again.  After doing some research, this is a common problem with these bottles. 
The game itself is very interesting - the storyline is engaging and the controls are unique.  It's an RPG, which is quite a switch for Mario.  The major problem with this game is interactivity - not enough of it.  Specifically, there are far too many cutscenes that are not skippable.  Many of these cutscenes lead directly into a boss battle.  The most frustrating instance of this is just before the final boss battle - it takes about 10 minutes to get to the "real" fight from the prior save point.  This isn't a problem for the first time through the sequence, but if you lose 4 or 5 times, this just becomes a hassle and makes the game not really worth playing to see the end.  This is a major problem that most game designers have found work-arounds for, but Nintendo revealed its lack of RPG experience in this element.  It's an interesting game, but just make sure to win, or have a friend/sibling/(enemy?) skip through the dialog sequences for you if you get tired of them
Even as a joke, this would be horrible; however, I think this band take it seriously - and it blows!  I picked up this CD because I heard A.R.E. were like a combination of suicide, front 242, and iron maiden: Interesting.  NO!!  A.R.E. are a bad imitation of front 242 and watered-down Liars at best.  The guitar riffs are awful and the lyrics are even worse.   Example: "Hey World" begins with how much it sucks to be 13.   ---  --- When I saw Pelican in concert, they were opening (?!?!?) for A.R.E., so I decided to give them a second chance.  The sound guy must not have liked what he heard, because the bar chatter was louder.  "Louder" I yelled, so that I might find something redeeming in their music.  "Yeah, SUCK louder!" Someone else yelled - I had to agree & give him a high-five.  Maybe I would have liked this when I was 12 and didn't know any better.  ZERO STARS
I own Hallmark Card Studio 2006, and this product is a different, interesting addition to greeting-card-making.  It has lots of kinds of pictures, i.e., aquatic mammals/fish, etc, for making "fun" children's cards
This performs better than the unit offered at the Apple store at about 20% of the cost! Plus it has an indicator light and the folding plug is handy for travel. Good deal
This train table is a nice size, bigger than I expected. It went together easily and is sturdy enough for my grandson's Thomas stuff. It seems to be made as well as what I saw at Toys R Us for double the price.
I recently purchased this shoe after a friend of mine recommended ASICS shoes to me. This is my first pair of running shoes and I am very pleased with it. The shoes were very comfortable from the day one.  ---  --- One comment that I have about the shoe is that they are quite narrow in the front. I have wide feet and would have prefferred a little wider shoe. I worked out fine for me, however, because I had purchased 1/2 size longer than what I usually wear.  ---  --- Overall, I am very happy with this pair and would recommend it
I was very excited to receive the Armoire this past weekend.  However, after opening the package we found a crack on one of the pieces.  I called Strokcraft directly to see what the alternatives were for this type of issue.  The only way to compensate for the issue was replacement of the part. The rep indicated that the delivery of the new part can take anywhere from 3-4 weeks.  With the baby coming in within a week or so, who has the time to wait. The product is what you pay for. 
This is a great lens for any user, professional or amateur.  This lens offers incredibly wide focal lengths all while giving very impressive/clean results.  A slight distortion is noticeable when shooting at 10mm (16mm cropped) but this is easily correctable with software.  In addition, the very fast and absolutely silent USM is a huge plus.  I highly recommend this lens to anyone wanting great landscapes or great in door/architecture shots (especially realtors)
Tastes great - Less Calories. Amazon's pricing is cheaper than my local grocery store so I stocked up
This hair dryer did dry my hair quickly. BUT, it quit working after a month. I exchanged it for another just like it and the same thing happened a few weeks later. --- The buttons were also hard to switch. This was a waste of money. I ended up buying a completely different hair dryer
Breyer makes such authentic lifelike replicas of the worlds most beautiful horses.  My daughter is in horse heaven.  The detail is so accurate that my daughter noticed even the footpad of the horses were unique to each one
This is the first time I settled for "byzantine" style of jewelry but I like it. It is a big and shining bracelet that perfectly matches with dark or black clothes. It would make an excellent gift for a man especially if the guy is not skinny
This stuff is awesome if you have dry, coarse, or damaged hair.  This is lush, creamy and lathers up well. This is a wonderful luxury shampoo. You will feel like a queen/star when you wash your hair with this. The smells is fresh and yummy. I love using this stuff except I cannot use this every day as it will weigh my hair down. My hair is fine and straight and has some natural wave in the back. I highly recommend this product and will buy it again
I got this bed topper a couple weeks ago to place on my older matress.  It was pretty pungent, but it felt so good the first time I layed in it.  after a couple days it appeared to lose it's memory and start to dent and crease, but eventually it got back to full expansion.  The customer service with this item was fantastic! ---  --- We'll see how long the matress keeps up its memory
I order this magazine for my wife. She is a good cook but is enchanted with the magazin
I saw this movie on t.v. for the first time a few days ago and now I'm buying the DVD. I'm not a big fan of action movies but I do watch them now and again. I've read quite a few negative reviews about this film and I think they are undeserved. When I saw it I thought it was good, not Diehard good, but it held its own. I really enjoyed it. I really liked the idea that they included a female member of SWAT. One never sees a woman SWAT member. It looks like this is one of those movies you either love, like, or hate. One has to make up one's own mind
There aren't many films from any era that come close to being "perfect" (though that's not really the right word) in just about every way--probably you could count them on your fingers and have some left over. ---  --- "Friendly Persuasion" is one of those films--in spades. Directed by William Wyler and starring Gary Cooper, Dorothy McGuire, and Tony Perkins, it is a wonderful, human story about a loving family of Quakers (also known as Friends) living in one of the Union-Confederate "border" states at the time of the Civil War in the 1860s. ---  --- The cast, in small roles and large, is uniformly excellent, none calling attention to themselves but rather becoming their characters and making us understand them. Led by beloved, legendary star Gary Cooper in a great performance as the head of the Quaker family Jess Birdwell, they are marvelous, including child actor Richard Eyer as feisty "Little Jess", scrapping with his big sister or partaking in a running feud with "Samantha", his mother Eliza Birdwell's pet goose, who more than carries her end of the feud with scene-stealing craftiness. ---  --- There are incidents of family humor and love and occasional disagreements, and a hilarious episode in which eldest son Josh  (Perkins) accompanies father Jess on a sales trip and is set upon by the scrappy, amorous daughters of one of Jess's customers (Marjorie Main). We are settled into a lovely, lively exploration of the Birdwell family's idyllic existence. ---  --- Then the war intrudes. ---  --- Josh feels he must volunteer to fight as long as others have to, even though it is against the teachings of his faith. His younger sister loves a young Union officer who is soon to go into battle. Rebel troops are nearing the region where they live, and no one, including the audience, quite knows what will happen. ---  --- There is a beautifully honest and dramatic sequence in which young Josh gets his first taste of battle, which Perkins performs with heartbreaking realism. I recall my father, a World War II veteran, saying that this scene was the most realistic depiction of a young man's first time in battle that he had ever seen in the movies. ---  --- When it is all over and the Birdwells return to their quiet, hard-working, loving life as a family, the music (Dimitri Tiomkin's marvelous score) swells, the wonderful lyrics to the song "Friendly Persuasion" are sung sweetly by the young Pat Boone, and you realize you have spent two wonderful hours with these genuinely fine, completely human characters in ordinary life and in challenging times. ---  --- The story has been told with integrity, honesty, humanity, gentle humor, kind restraint and, yes, love--all of these also attributes of the Birdwell family that we have come to know. That is the "genius" of this film. Along with a very few others, it shows us who we are, who we can be, and how we can live, all with a grace and humility that is almost poetic. And the film never, ever loses its balance. ---  --- It's just a great and good movie. I've seen it almost a dozen times, and it can still move me to tears. I'm betting it could be released today, amid the ridiculously over-budgeted, badly executed films that rely too much on computer effects and star charisma, and that it would clean up at the box office. ---  --- The term "family values" has been kicked around a lot lately, and nobody quite seems to know what is really meant by it. Watch this truly beautiful film and you'll get a pretty good idea of the genuine meaning of those words.
Has anyone else experienced the following ?: Used the first twenty or so in a stack of 100 without any problems, then have run into (so far) a run of at least 30 defective discs after the remainder sat unused for a few months. After various attempts to narrow down the problem, I tracked it down to the blank CD-Rs. I had exactly the same problem occur with another brand, which was replaced with these TDKs. Is there some unwritten shelf life for blank CD-Rs or am I just unlucky?
Despite its size, this product works wonderfully! I have already used it multiple times to start my SUV on days when the weather has dipped below zero, and it's worked every time. ---  --- I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a reasonably priced Jump Starter
I just bought this yesterday, and though the product description here on Amazon says it's compatible with Windows 98 and Windows ME, the packaging says "TaxCut USB Drive is compatible with Windows 2000 and Windows XP."  All our taxes for several years have been done on a Windows ME computer with a USB port.  Now what?  HELP!
Alright, for those of you who say Rand is criticizing works for false ideals, or lacking in substance, I say this: who is Rand to say what the absolute greatest ideals are?  Who is Rand to say what substance is?  You've got to look at her bias, first.  Realize that Rand never takes into account anything not related to personal freedom.  As if outside factors never matter; and maybe they don't, for her.  Maybe her life in an oppressive Russia did nothing to form who she is today.  But I doubt it. ---  --- Though I believe personal choice plays a huge factor in determining who we are and how we live, outside influences do affect a person.  But she doesn't.  Thus she condemns all works that are not driven solely by the individual as crap.  All books that are not driven solely by the individual's sense of reason: don't read, cause it will lessen your IQ.   ---  --- Any work that portrays or is driven by an emotion she doesn't find worthwhile or cannot understand, she condemns. ---  --- Rand, at least as portrayed in what I've read of her work, is unfeeling toward anything but what she wants.  And this is carried over into this book in what she criticizes.  They cannot hold a little or a fairly large amount of quality, they are either good or worthless.   The pieces of art she says are empty ARE empty, absolutely.  They don't fit into her paradigm thus have nothing to offer.  Nothing to offer her, that is.   ---  --- How is a completely selfish person supposed to write a critique of history's best books, telling OTHER people (with different wants and ideas and all the other funtions of an individual) What they should read?  Truthfully any criticism in this form, like a list I saw detailing the 100 best literary works in the world, is elitist crap trying to close people's minds toward books that a certain group deems lesser than others.  They have their bias like anyone else. ---  --- I say read in variety.  Observe art outside of Rand's choice of art.  Take in all you can, with an open mind, then start pondering whether you agree or not.  If you then agree because YOU agree, then I say great.  Its the basic individualistic response that Rand seems to forget to address.  She says question society, but by my line of inquiry.  She says be an individual, but only I know the basis of who you want to be
I think this product is highly overated and this claim --- of being 99% accurate is false. --- Once in while it can amaze you by typing a sentence with 100% accuracy , but this enthusiasm is quickly dashed when --- you realise that the very next sentence is complete --- gibberish which bears absolutely no relation to what you --- said and you wonder how it could have possibly interpeted --- what you have in that manner. --- I think this program maybe accent sensitive so that a person with an American accent may get good results while  --- a person with a British or an Australian accent may get poor results for the same level of training. --- In summary I think the program is unreliable with an --- accuracy of 45% at its present level of developement. --- It has plenty of potential and with future developement ---  it could much more reliable but at its present level of --- developement I think the performance is mediocre.  
Creating Keepsakes Scrapbook Designer Version 2 Deluxe - This seems to be a nice program, but I have not found much use for it as of yet.  My intention, when buying it, was to use it for scrapbooking but also greeting cards.  I am sure that I will use it in the future as the program has nice graphics and is easy to navigate.  Broederbund products are usually very user friendly
This thing just doesn't work, don't bother.  It won't stay upright no matter what you do, so there's no way for the kids to play any form of tether ball with it.  Looks like it would be fun if it worked.  The most entertaining thing about it was that the dog kept barking at it for some reason.
Hard to figure why Sean Stewart isn't one of the most beloved writers in America, given the virtuoso performance he's demonstrated here and the remarkably sympathetic character he's created in Will Kennedy.  A combination horror/fantasy work which is as reminiscent of A Confederacy of Dunces as it is Ghosts, by Hynd, this novel is filled with so much warmth and life that it's hard to remember that this actually is a story about a man who understands that the past, too, can be a ghost, and perhaps the worst kind. ---  --- Perfect Circle is everything every other supposed 5-star horror novel featured on Amazon is supposed to be: well-written, compelling, with rich, empathetic characters and a driving force and tension all its own. ---  --- It's a wonderful introduction to Mr. Stewart's work
I haven't had an outbreak of acne in about 5 years until I started using this cream. I kept using it thinking that my huge cysts couldn't possibly be from this very pricey stuff. I went to the dermo and she said to stay away from these thick creams specifically for anti-aging because they are horrible for your skin. I went back to my cheap neutrogena lotion for anti- aging and it felt sooo much better and lighter and within a week my skin cleared up. I didn't even realize how very thick this stuff was until I started back on my neutrogena. I feel so bad about the $$$ I lost and I wish I would've gotten a sample first. I encourage you to do the same.
The padding is too bulky toward the knuckels. There is no padding on the fingers. The gloves are closed palm so your hands get sweatier faster. Overall these gloves are a poor excuse for grappling gloves
i was very satisfied with my purchase of these items.reasonable price and am very happy with items
I have seen Phantom on stage twice and regularly listen to this cast recording.  It is a different approach to the classic Leroux novel; one that is gentler and more romantic, but still intense and passionate.  The lyrics and music are excellent. --- Even if you are an ALW/PTO fan, don't miss this production if it plays nearby.
She is so cute! I love the real hair, I've made loads of crazy designs. Also, I made a discovery, if you squeeze her tummy, she cries, falls asleep or says "I luv you mama"
This is great granola and at such a great price! I usually make my own, but for this price, it's not worth the effort! Thanks for the great value
It installed without any problems.  It runs without any problems. I am very happy with it.  ---  --- I am a convert from Microsoft Money.  I am self employed and have one employee.  My wife is also self-employed.  We have twenty different financial accounts (investment accounts, retirement accounts, checking accounts, savings accounts, a mortgage, a home equity line of credit and credit cards).  We often pay business expenses with our personal credit card, as the credit card gives us frequent flyer miles for every purchase.  Quicken 2007 Home and Business allows us to do our personal accounting and business accounting all in one program, which makes it much easier.   ---  --- The one step update (automatic downloading of our transactions and balances from financial institutions) works with 17 of our 20 accounts.  Downloading data from the other 3 accounts requires some manual steps, but is still fairly painless. ---  --- I like the online backup feature. It is inexpensive (you pay a small annual charge) and easy to use. ---  --- I am not very impressed with the investment analysis features, although I have not yet fully explored them.  I would like to be able to compute realized and unrealized annualized rates of return for individual positions or groups of positions, and it doesn't seem like I can do that in this program.
I am very disappointed with this ring.  It is very pretty, but once you take the string off it falls apart and there are no instructions to put it back together.  My husband and I have been trying to put it back together based on the picture of the ring on this website and have had NO luck.  Now all I have is a pile of silver rings that I cannot wear.  If anyone knows how to put this back together, please post how!  Thanks
Great little item. Charges phone and second battery at the same time. It is nice to have it on the desk and I can use the speaker phone on my desk. No complaints about this charger at all
I only installed the product two days ago and have not really been able to give it a solid workout. That said, my initial take is very positive. As a writer and lousy typist, I think it will increase my productivity expotentially. I look forward to really getting into the nuts and bolts of the product very soon
Bought this for my 6 month grandson.  Worked about 1 week & then quit. Have changed batteries but still doesn't work.  Guess it was too good to be true!  Spend your money on another crib toy
I bought this drive in late 2003, and it's gone through a moderate amount of use in a home environment since then. The positives first - though it has an 8MB buffer it is very fast, and can even stand its ground against some newer disks with larger buffers.  ---  --- It does make quite a bit of noise and heats up a bit more compared to my older 40gig and 20gig WD's, and the newer seagates.  ---  --- 2.5 years after purchase, the drive started corrupting files like crazy. WD has tools on their site to check your disk status, and sure enough it was due for an RMA. When I checked the warranty status online, 6 months had mysteriously 'vanished' from my warranty period. The drive warranty had started 6 months before I'd purchased it! Anyway, it was still valid and they sent me a replacement very quick. ---  --- Still, this is my second WD drive to die, and I'm going with other brands from now.
At this moment in our history we need all the input about the multiple facets of the hideous War Machine that has an apparent strangle hold on every country on the planet.  In this Russian meditation, 100 DAYS BEFORE THE COMMAND, we are shown the behind-locked-doors view of youth preparing to become soldiers and leaders of soldiers.  On the surface the director's eye seems to be telling us that 'boot camp' for these VERY young appearing boys is no more than a summer camp experience.  But then he gradually shows the darker, terrifying side of what preparing these innocents for war produces - suffering, self-doubt, death, alienating behaviour, dreams and nightmares.  There is an incredible sense of innocence in the eyes of these youth, and a groping for comradery that lightly brushes on eroticism.  The multiple nude scenes seem to be offending more people than the Russian censors, but they are some of the more tender and tangible scenes in this meandering film about questioning our place and mindsets in the propagation of war leaders.  Of note, in this very Russian film, the music used in the background is all Bach - excerpts form the Passions, cantatas - instead of works by Russian composers.  This adds another dimension to this apparent 'paean' for world peace.  This film is not for everyone, especially not for those who still have difficulty with male nudity........
I've tried all types of eyeliner, and they all end up smudging or flaking off, very messy by the end of a long day (or night).  I bought this one to wear at my wedding (in the fantastic chocolate shade) and it was absolutely perfect!  Well worth the price.  Great wear, easy to apply (with a very skinny-tipped brush, I ended up using a tiny paintbrush)and stays exactly where you put it
 ---  --- I've read The New Yorker since 1963 and though it seemed a better magazine then, it is still a very good magazine now. As magazines go, it may even be one of the best this nation has ever published. ---  --- For good writing, reporting, cartoons, and opinion one can do no better than this well known magazine. And their occasional special issues offer abundant pages that double their weekly issue. I don't believe any issue in all the years I've read it hasn't had at least a couple items of interest, with some of the issues being read from front cover to back. ---  --- Try a copy, it might just be for you. ---  --- Semper Fi
The wife looked incredulous, but I had the last laugh as I pasted a beefy, juicy kiss of sugary goodness on her cheek last night just as she was dozing off to bed. Seeing the drooly goo drip off onto the pillow made the night on the couch all worth while.  ---  --- Thank you World Kitchens for two pounds of steer delight.
This is the first time I have subscribed to this magazine.  I really like the article topics but wish that there was more data included to back the articles. 
I received this as a gift and at first I thought it was great, but then I realized it would only display 142 images. I worked with technical support for several months (they are not the speediest or most helpful). I resized, renamed, restructured the photos, tried them on different media and finally they admitted it was a bug. I RMA'd the unit at my shipping expense of course, only to recieve another with the same problem.  I wouldn't recommend this purchase
We would like to send this item back.  The construction was flimsy, and the assembly is very cumbersome.  One of the pieces broke when it was being assembled.  The item was inexpensive, but not worth the trouble to assemble
... with both the basic fence 5-piece HearthGate system and a great fit with the decor of our home.  Highly recommend the entire system.  Kare
Quicken software continues to contain prominent advertising for Intuit products and services.  In my opinion, it is fine to offer additional services to customers, but give the customer the opportunity to say "no thanks" and then leave them alone so they can be productive with the software.  Forever pestering a paid customer with advertising for the same products and services is not a good idea.  Advertising takes up space in the user interface and is a distraction that reduces productivity
By the time I came to this movie, I had already gotten there first three. Up in Smoke was fantastic, Next Movie was great, Nice Dreams was good, this was was pretty poor. They get pretty desparate at some points here, and they constantly repeat chracters we've seen already. --- The Low points are when they attempt to impersonate two homosexuals (badly), the astronaut which is Cheech miming for 3 minutes of in space, and then pretentds to jerk off at the end. Also, when they got to "Harry Palms" masterbating Champion, that was about as low and unfunny as you could get, just awful. All the points in the stand-up go on about a minute too long, including the fake nightclub. The people laughing at Cheech doing a redneck, had to have been payed actors. --- There are some good points... not that many though. Maybe the wrestling scene, and some of the scene with Chong recording with a videocamera in the hotel room. They don't seem to do much in this. I wanted something different, which is what I got, but I didn't think it would be this horrible. These guys can do better.
I bought these gloves for my wife who has problems keeping her hands warm. The description of the gloves would have you believe that the battery powered gloves (using D cell Batteries) would provide heat to the hands for 6 to 8 hours.  In actuality, the battery will only provide heat for 35 to 40 minutes before it ends.  To make matters worse, the only heat provided is to the palm of the hand, no heat is provided to the fingers! ---  --- I did not use a cheap brand of battery for these gloves.  The first battery that I tried (it takes one D cell per glove) was Duracel with an experation date of 2013 (in other words, brand new battery with lots of shelf life left).  That battery provided heat for 40 minutes before dying. ---  --- The second set of batteries that I tried (with the same experation date) were made by Eveready.  That battery lasted 35 minutes.  You should also note that the Duracel fits poorly in the connector case and the Eveready battery fits even worse! ---  --- These gloves are on their way to Goodwill.  Maybe they can be used by some one as work gloves or something.   ---  --- If you are considering these gloves, think again!  The chemical packs work much better although they (the chemical packs) do have a shelf life.  It just seemed such a waste to us to use a chemical pack for a one hour walk and then have the pack continue to provide heat for another 4 to 6 hours.  Still, that is better than using up two D cell batteries for less heat that only lasts about 40 minutes. ---  --- 
Clever and stylish design; a lot of colors to choose from; and an excellent performance, best sport shoe eve
I WAS TORN AT WHAT REMOTE CONTROL CAR TO BUY MY 4 YEAR OLD SON.  THE SALES CLERK AT THE DISNEY STORE COULDN'T SAY ENOUGH ABOUT THIS CAR, MY SON IS A HUGE "CARS" FAN--I WAS SOLD!!  IT NEVER WORKED, IT JUST JERKED A LITTLE BIT!  MY 2 YEAR OLDS FISHER PRICE CAR WORKS A LOT BETTER FOR A THIRD OF THE PRICE.  NOW I GOT THE BOYS FIGHTING OVER THE BABY CAR AND DON'T EVEN ASK FOR LIGHTNING MCQUEEN.  I AM GOING BACK TO THE STORE AND GET MY MONEY BACK.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS TOY!!  THANK YOU.  
Great way to get rid of stress in the office.  Suction cup bottom works extremely well. 
I received the order in record time and in excellet condition. Saved time from trying to find it in a store loacally, and arrived right at my door step.  ---  --- Really cool item, my son loves it
I used Version 8 and 9 and NEVER experienced a problem.  Version 10.latest version is terrible.  Crash and burn.  Don't take their advice and re-install your operating system.  Its THEIR software and not the OS.  Amazon and Pinnacle (Avid) continue to sell this product even though its terrible.  I read it was re-written for version 10 and they CAN'T get it right.  Nonetheless, they still charge full price and for support calls. The upgrade should have been free. ---  --- There are several good products now so Pinnacle isn't your only choice.  I changed to Sony Vegas and am very happy but it does a have a learning curve.  For super simple try Ulead or one of the others.
I had a previous non-brand name digital tire gauge and it worked great but eventually died. I bought this one thinking it would be better. The first time I used it I couldn't get a good connection at all and it kept giving me multiple readings.  It also does not seem to keep the number on the display after the reading. It would disappear before i could read it fully.
I bought these extensions because I had to have them so that the co-sleeper would fit properly next to my bed.  However, when added the sleeper didn't seem as steady or stable on the floor.  There was a lot more sway in the sleeper with the extensions than without them.  While not a big issue because the sleeper was attached to my bed, I expected something a little more solid or sturdy. 
This is one of the most beautiful, sexy scents currently on the market.  If you are a gourmand/oriental fragrance lover (examples of which include Thierry Mugler's Angel or Angel Innocent, Bvlgari's Omnia, Calvin Klein's Euphoria, or Burberry's Brit - all of which I own and wear regularly without longevity issues - see next paragraph) then I would highly recommend this fragrance.  Sweet, but in a sexy, subtle musky way.   ---  --- I would bathe myself in this fragrance if I could.  And I should.  As noted by the previous reviewer, this fragrance is gone in flash.  I give myself about 5 hearty sprays of this in the morning, including two directly misted onto my clothing in an effort to extend the fragrance, but it is gone by noon.  This is truly perplexing.  Every other Giorgio Armani frangrance that I own, including Sensi, Emporio She, and Armani Code for Men (also great for women), can go the distance.   ---  --- This is supposed to be Eau de Parfum, but wears very much like Eau de Toilette.  Someone seriously skimped on the oil base.  It that doesn't trouble you terribly, pick this one up.  If you want something similar that will last through the entire day and most of the night, and particularly love the musk component of this fragrance, then I would wholeheartedly recommend checking out Narciso Rodriguez's "For Her" or "Musc for Her" instead
I absolutely love this magazine. I look forward to sitting and enjoying it every month. I only wish it would be a weekly magazine because I can't wait for the next edition. I use so many ideas from Romantic Homes. Keep those great ideas coming
It looks like a cartoon snail, and it makes a racket when you squeeze it.  I'd say it lives up to everything it aspires to be
This is perfect for someone who is prone to knock things around that are on their belt. My husband uses this one and it has taken lots of knocks. I would give it 5 starts but its downside is that it dulls the vibration so he misses alot of calls
There are more expensive units out there and they might be appropriate for you if you need more information.  But this one is perfect for what I need. ---  --- I had "Check Engine" lights on both my 2000 Accord and 2005 Camry.  I wanted to find out what the problems were so I could decide if it was something that needed immediate attention and to find out if it was something I could fix myself. ---  --- It found the problems on both cars within a couple of minutes and reset the errors.  The Honda had a "proprietary" error so I installed the database software (extremely easy to install) and looked it up (extremely easy to use). ---  --- Turns out both cars had non-critical problems and I could just reset the errors.  This would have cost me $150 at my car maintenance shop. ---  --- This device also functions as a pollution control system diagnostic tool.  I haven't tried that yet but it will be interesting to see how that works. ---  --- I would highly recommend this for the "casual" user.  Pros would probably need something that does more stuff, but this will be extremely useful for shade-tree mechanics
Yes, I love Microsoft Office. It's incredibly user friendly, it has wonderful features, most of which I don't even know how to use, and it's spelling and grammar checking features are the best of it's kind. I've been fortunate enough to have been a student up to now in my life and therefore did not have to buy Microsoft for my personal use, the school would always buy one for me. And of course there are always illegitimate means... but I'm not advocating piracy here. ---  --- However, I would be the last person on earth to consider using Microsoft Office if I had to pay $350 for it. It's an insane price. consider the alternatives: ---  --- Open Office: Does everything MS Office does, some things even better. I love how you don't need to buy or install anything extra to type mathematical formulas in Open Office. The best thing about this, however, is that it's FREE! ---  --- Google Docs and Spreadsheets: This one is even better. Not only is it free like everything else from Google, you can COLLABORATE IN REAL TIME with  anybody else on the internet to write your word documents! Nothing beats that, it's just the most wonderful thing that Google has done
We have a very small kitchen so I knew I could never have a large highchair. I registered for the Healthy Chair by Fisher Price but after putting my son in it once to try it out I returned it for this one and never regretted it. This one has a higher back, reclines and has a comfortable cushion that is removable and washable (the one I have is better than the one shown. I bought it at babiesrus). It actually comes with 2 cushions and 2 abc/123 plastic mats that go on the tray. My son is very comfortable in it and I love that we can take it anywhere. 
I buy a lot of cards and they are always Hallmartk because I there quality is wonderful.  The kit is of the same high quality.  It also lets you personalize them with your own text and your own pictures.  It was one of the best things I ever bought and I know I well use it a lot
The book "Communicating Effectively" is a home run!  The format invites an easy read with quick reference potential.  Building on the fundamentals of good communication Lani takes us around the bases and adds authentic and practical ways of dealing with issues we all face.  She brings us home again with new skills learned and a more effective game plan to approach the communication challenge
It is really very nice, and my colleague would like to buy that too. They made my car looks very comfortable
I used version 8 of this product and decided to upgrade even though all the reviews here warned against it.  Boy are they right.  This thing is terrible. ---  --- After installing on Windows XP SP2, as soon as I started the program it crashed.  Now every time I try to scan using my Canon Scanner, it crashes every time. ---  --- Product is useless.  Wish I had of never bought it! ---  --- DO NOT BUY!
These are the best windproof liner gloves out there.  I freaked out thinking they had discontinued them because I thought they were made of Gore Windstopper and couldn't find any that said "made with Gore Windstopper" but actually it's Polarguard Windbloc.  In any case, when you freak out becuase you think you might not be able to get something again you realize just how much you like that thing.  ---  --- These are totally windproof.  Extremely compact, I don't think you can make them any thinner than this.  Good price.   ---  --- The only "downside" is that they take a long time to dry out when they get wet.  This is true of any windproof glove so it's really not fair to call it a down side of this particular glove.  These weigh nothing (probably about an ounce each) and so I pack two or three pairs if I know I'll be getting them wet.  ---  --- I wear these ice climbing, hiking, mountaineering, I have a pair I cut the finger tips off of for rock climbing in winter, and I wear them skiing inside of my mittens.  ---  --- These really shine inside of mittens because if you have to do anything with your hands the mitten must come off and these completely protect your hands from the wind during that time.  I haven't had cold hands skiing for two seasons now, a problem that plagued me for years.  ---  --- I can't recommend these enough.   ---  --- -Scott
I wanted more recipes and this magazine has too much other junk in it.  Will not renew, not what I wanted
If you are buying this because you love Rob, be aware this is the Rob wearing his Goblin Cock hat.  If you aren't familiar with this incarnation...let's just say it ain't the Rob of Pinback or Heavy Vegetable fame.  Same guy, different sensitivity. ---  --- I fell in love with Rob because he seemed to make sense out of all the nonsense out there.  On this outing, Rob has met the enemy and it is himself.  He's entitled to do as he pleases and you and I are entitled to not care for it.  This CD is not an acquired taste, it is a forced-feeding
We enjoyed this video. The rugby athletes are fun to watch in such a surreal setting. Somehow, these tough, big athletes being posed and shot in various homoerotic poses gives new meaning to "Sporn".
what to write? the book is kinda story book, and gives passages after passages. if you are looking for a book that gives exercises to develop your psychic power, this one's not for you
As a practicing photographer and not a collector, I've been very disappointed with B&W on the few occasions it's crossed my desk (I've never had a subscription, so I'm basing this on just the few issues I've seen). ---  --- Quality wise, the last issue I received was poorly printed - it contained streaks through the images and rampant misregistration, among other things. The paper is unimpressive as is the printing itself - the line-screen looks quite course. In a full-colour magazine, it would be fine, but for one in which everything is in monochrome, I would expect that they would print stochastically or at a higher resolution etc. ---  --- In terms of content, every time I've seen this magazine it has been filled with work which is typically very well-executed technically but un-innovative and un-inspirational, at least to me. Most of it is of the hobbyist/dedicated amateur variety, with few capital-A Artists or professionals. Stereotypical nature and bodyscape-style photos seem to dominate, with few examples of conceptual, thematic or `high art' work, and I've never seen any fashion or photo-journalism either. ---  --- We could use more non-technical photography magazines, but B&W caters to an audience obsessed with traditionalism and the imitation of old masters such as Cartier-Bresson and Ansel Adams. ---  --- PS: reading body copy set in Futura with tight leading is a real pain
I was looking for a wrap to go with a black backless dress. This scarf was perfect. It added just enough color with a little sparkle and was plenty large to use as a wrap. Very pretty
I do all my burning on a standard Windows Media player, and it's almost entirely data and music, no video. For my purposes, these CD's sound great. In some cases, it actually seems like the discs have enhanced the sound spectrum somewhat. That may be a trick my ears are playing on me but, nevertheless, I'm a big fan of the Memorex. And they're a steal if you catch the sale price. Recommended
This shaver has met all my expectations. It cleans and recharges itself automatically. The shave is close and nick free. The only slight negative is the cleaning time per shave could run to 20 minutes
Although this new release from Barbie looks very much like the real life singer, the doll itself is not something I would recommend for a child under 12. The doll is dressed pretty sccantilly and is adorned with realistic jewlerly.  It also comes with a bracelet appropriate for a teen.  The short hair of this doll and tight clothing does not lend itself to childs play and is more suited to a serious doll collector or McBride fan
You got to have extremely steady hand, or camera stand to use this camaera. ---  --- During my niece wedding, I put in a 2GB of memory and we were trigger happy, we must have took over couple hundred of pictures, however, I am very unhappy about the result. 3 out of 5 pictures are fuzzy, messy, out of focus. ---  --- On the other hand, for the pictures that took a few mins to line up and with a very very steady hand, you got a great picture. ---  --- Size is good, weight is a bit on the heavy side for the size, but to some people that's good quality
I purchased this camera for my own birthday present last October.  I have owned it for 1 year and 2 months and now it isn't working.  I paid $400.00 for it last year when it was "new."  The LCD will only turn on every 15 - 20 times after I take the batteries out and turn the camera on and off. I purchased new rechargeable batteries, but that wasn't the answer.  I contacted Panasonic but it is out of the warrantee period.  They will charge a flat $140.00 to fix it and I can get a new one for about $150.00.  I loved this camera, but it is such a disappointment.  I was very easy with it - it just stopped working!  Buy a different camera - I wish I had
  Of the Gloria Jean coffees mudslide is my favorite.  Good taste when used with the Keurig B70 and the 9.25 oz size brew.  I am on my 2nd order, over 50 k cups made, and have never had a misfire.  The previous reviewer simply had a bad batch
Whenever I'm asked what is the worst movie I have ever seen, I quickly respond, "Cabin Boy." It is like a long, meandering, and entirely pointless joke one might hear from an obnoxious coworker. I would describe the plot, but there is none. I watched the entire movie waiting for the punchline, but it never came. It was written by a former staff writer for David Letterman, which is the only conceivable reason that Letterman would agree to appear in such a monstrosity. Even he later joked about how awful the movie was. Chris Elliott plays the only character he has ever played--the annoyimg dumb guy loser. His limited acting talent, combined with a nonsensical plot, unfunny dialogue, and an absurd tendency to confuse silliness with humor, truly make Cabin Boy a cinematic experience everyone should miss
I was misled and thought I was buying the entire cd and it contains one song
These wipers are of the finest quality. They do a wonderful job of clearing the rain from your windshield. I highly recommend them for replacement of your current wiper blades. You won't be disappointed in these excellent wipers. I've tried many, these are the best and they're made in the USA
Sorry to disagree with all those reviewers who loved this movie, but Peter Sellers did many better films than this. "Dr. Strangelove" was the masterpiece.  "Being There" is an underrated and understated sendup of how things happen in Washington.  "The World of Henry Orient" (AT LAST on DVD!)is priceless but virtually unknown, with delicious performances from Sellers and especially his teenage tormentors.  Finally, the "Pink Panther" series is much better slapstick than "After the Fox," which has many famous, talented participants but is mostly silly, unfortunately not as hilariously and frenetically silly as Clouseau & Co. One irritant was the repetition and prolongation of gags and situations, as if we might not notice them otherwise. I agree with other reviewers that Victor Mature does as well as possible with the role he is allotted, and Martin Balsam does okay with his stuff, too. When watching this film, I kept thinking the same thoughts as when attending a mediocre restaurant -- I could have cooked up something better than this myself for a lot less money
we homeschool and have 1st grader, 4th grader and 7th grader - they are all using the program and learning and enjoying - my 1st grader especially enjoys the fact that it's on an island since he's all about pirates. a great first program
THIS WAS AT 1OTH BIRTHDAY GIFT FOR MY SON. --- WE ARE CALIFORNIA TRANSPLANTS LIVING IN TEXAS, AND NO ONE HERE, AT THE TIME, HAD ANY IDEA THAT KOBE HAD EVEN CHANGED HIS NUMBER FROM 8 TO 24. IT WAS A NIGHTMARE (AND A LOT OF DRIVING AROUND) TRYING TO FIND KB'S 24. ---   --- I FOUND IT ON YOUR SITE AND THE PRODUCT WAS JUST WHAT I EXPECTED, NO SURPRISES.  MY SON LOVES IT! ---  ---  --- 
I was surprised to open this pedometer page after sometime and see all the negative reviews it receives. I have been using this specific model for more than 3 months now and I am really satisfied with it. It is really accurate (<1% declination, I have performed more than four tests of more than 400 steps during different times of its life and I have seen a couple of cheap pedometers performing much worse), clips firmly to belt or pants, displays the time conveniently and has nice backlight, even has a radio which works, although as most people said, not really its best feature. The truth is that I am not using the radio at all, mostly because I believe the batteries will last longer and it will save me from extra trips to Walmart. But I have tested it and it works, although nothing impressive there. Of course, for the money, I think you cannot go wrong with this pedometer. ---  --- One funny comment is that, although most people complain it cannot open very easily, after sometime it will open more easily that you think. Actually it has been a couple of times where putting a bag on my shoulders or a waist pouch and applying some pressure on it by mistake, will open it wide, so it does not count any steps. But it does not open by itself anyway, needs external force for this to happen, so it does not happen often. ---  --- All in all, I am sure that the plastic construction and the less than rigorous production testing will result in many pieces that do not function properly and will result in bad reviews. Maybe I have been lucky, maybe not, but this has been one of the best and most reliable devices that I carry and use every day. And a great incentive for walking and exercising more
I have camped for several thousands of nights in all types of weather.  Over the years I have had a wide range of camp cots including the same style as the xl camp cot but not the same size.  This cot will provide everthing that I'm looking for.  My sleeping bag is wide and fits very nicely on the cot.  The cot is eazy to set up and take down and fits nicely in the handy carring bag.  The only down side to the cot is it's not a back pack cot but again neither is my sleeping bag.  In short it's all a good fit and I hope to enjoy it for years to come.   Thanks Da
I'm ;logged in on my wife's accont. I never had problems with the band. I liked the first one so much that after I ran over it with my car, I ordered another. If you think of it as a throw away watch and keep it for two years, you'll love it. It has a very intuitive design, is lightweight and just works
This trike in useless! Our 2yr. old tips over every time she tries to ride it. Buy something that's worth the money and safer! --- Now our daughter won't go near the thing, or any other trike! --- I expected much better from Radio Flyer
Ditto... I bought more of these. ---  --- Love the bibs with vinyl backings and absorbant terry fronts... really stops the soakings that happen with little ones who are teething. I bought these for a very low price that couldn't be beat. Nice quality
robeez are the only brand of shoes we even bother to use. they are well made and do not come off by accident or when baby tries to get them off! we've tried all of the other generic brands and they all come off, but not these. its worth it to spend the extra $$ on these shoes. and they're so well made they'll last for baby #2
First of all, let me tell you, this is NOT a date movie.  This is the most brutal graphic rape movie I have ever seen, and also one that lingers in your mind long after it is over.  For me, that's exactly what I want when I see a movie, one that leaves a lasting impression no matter how difficult the impression might be.  I loved this movie, because it is very very well made, and the acting performances are incredible.  Yes, the rapes are unforgiving in every respect, and the misery throughout the film is almost difficult to watch at times.  This is not a gory movie, except for the last ten minutes, it is a very disturbing movie and it does have a fair amount of nudity, however it really needs to.  "The Untold Story" and "Ebola Syndrome" offset much of the carnage with humor, but "Red to Kill" has absolutely NOTHING to smile about.  It is totally and brutally serious from the first frame to the extremely nasty ending.  The story is pretty simple, a psycho-rapist is on the loose and he's going after a mentally retarded young dancer.  In the second graphic rape of the movie he does the deed to the young lady.  Enter a female social worker who tries to help the victim, and dreams up a plan to get even with the rapist after he gets off in court because of a stupid technicality.  Her plan succeeds to a certain extent, but not like she planned it, and the rapist comes after her full force.  The actor who plays the rapist is absolutely sensational, and I might add, the musical score is perfect.  The music adds so much to the all ready existing tension from all the horrific acts.  The actress who plays the retarded girl is also amazing, one of the best performances on film you will ever see.  To end this, this is a must-see movie for fans of this genre, and I'm just getting started myself.  Not the gore associated with the two previous Cat III movies I watched, but something even more terrible and unrelenting, and an uneasy feeling that will not leave you anytime soon after you see it.  "Red to Kill" is flatout a good movie, even considering the subject matter.  I highly recommend it
The product is not working. The provider is terrible!! You can not reach them via email nor return the product. It is the worst experience in AMAZON!!  I wish I knew this provider and read these reviews before I bought it!!!
I was so excited to try this product from all of the great reviews that I read on it- boy where they wrong. I used this product for 2 months and saw no difference in my skin at all. I have used a lot of products and would have to rate this down at the bottom of my list- especially for how much it cost
Memorex changed the cases in this package, yet failed to reflect this on the packaging.  I purchased them at a local Office Depot.  It's the one with the patented hub that's supposed to protect your DVDs center.  Anyway, the two packages I got are no difference in comparison to regular cases I've gotten with sets I've bought.  I felt ripped off and will be returning these to the store for a refund
These earrings are quite nice.  Yes they do look brown up to the light, but they are a definite red when backed with any type of shadow.  They can be worn to accent an elegant look, or add style to a "Friday" casual look. They may not be heirloom quality, but could last quite a long time in the modern costume jewelry category.
i bought this straightener because everyone said it was wonderful and it was at a great price...BUT LOOKS CAN BE DECIEVING!! this straightener pulls my hair, it doesn't get very hot, it's kind-of uncomfortable to hold, and it DOESN'T STRAIGHTEN MY HAIR!!!
yes, i've had murad for about 2 weeks now and i've seen huge improvement! murad is a godsend! anyways... i was just wondering if the kit is really supposed to last me 2 months? i use it every morning and night. thats 120 times! umm... dont know if im gonna have any left... i know for sure the cleanser i will. (step 1) but steps 2 and 3 are very small quantity... and hopefully i wont need a lot of acne spot treatment usage cause they'll be all gone :) i definately recommend murad to everyone. like others, i've tried proactiv, but murad seems to work better with my skin. just try the one month starter kit first
Waking up to this product's sound and light is delightful.  Trying to read, at night, by the "daylight" bulb is not delightful.  The light is too dim.  I've done the things suggested by instructions and other users, to no success.  I must agree that, for the price, this product should have better sound and quality.  That leaves us with "Great idea, lousy execution!
You will not be dissapointed by buying this game! If you like RPGs, Action, and/or Adventure games, you'll love this one. There is soooooo much to do! Even after you've beat the game. With the huge maps, tons of free roaming space, and exciting side missions, you can play for hours without even starting the main mission. The sound and graphics are just about the best I've ever seen! The mian story is also awesome. It's easy to follow and tons of fun to play! Buy this!!!!
Season one of Nelwlyweds is hilarious....you will enjoy watching Nick & Jessica and all the funny moments that took place the first year of their marriage! The extra footage on the dvd's gives you even more insight from the "lovebirds" themselves! I recommond "Newlyweds" to all the Nick & Jessica fans out there
I don't see the difference between these bodysuits and the more expensive ones.  Fits my boy just right
I am very pleased with this rack.  the only thing I do not like is that to install the rack you have to hand tighten it to your roof rack.  I would have thought they would have a quick release latch or something.  I guess I'm just lazy.  I reccoment this product
I purchased the Sound Therapy Radio to take on a trip.  My roommate is a snorer, and I figured I needed the sound. I tried it out at home and liked it.  It has a good variety of sounds and is easy to figue out how to use. The alarm and clock are added goodies for me as I was looking for a sound machine that was small and light enough for travel.  It was a good buy for my purposes. 
It is almost impossible to get a clear picture on any channel and the sound quality is poor.  Buying this handheld was a big mistake
I ordered this magazine as a gift.  Not only was there no gift card sent, but the company sent the magazine to me instead of gift recipient.  It took about 20 minutes on the phone with the subscription company to fix the problem and not once was there any mention of an apology for the inconvenience.  The biggest disappointment was not having a gift on time! 
I like the story line of this movie, but most of all I remember watching it when I was a kid of seven. It was scary back then, even with limited special effects and no graphic details. Watching it now was very enjoyable I found myself going back in time. This film is in its own right a science fiction classic.                                         
This Electromate 400 saved me serveral times I will never be with out another one. Love it. I ordered this from Amazon one day and the next day it was here Very fast shipping. Well pleased Thank yo
This video gives insight into the life and persona of Picasso.  While it touches on his climb to fame, recognition and success in the art world, it focuses primarily on his personal relationships.  I love his work, but I  sure wouldn't have wanted to live with him!  The video had therapuetic  effects for me; I would assume it would for any viewer as it certainly  calls into question your own view of relationships, how they are and how  they should and shouldn't be. A winner all the way around
I first watched this movie in a class. A professor showed this movie and talked about Oedipus complex. I am not sure about this concept in it but sure enough this is an excellent movie
This has got to be the worst pile of trash I ever heard, right now I cant think of anything worse then this. The same ol trash bling and girls. And if you got JD and Bow wow on your album at the same time, its gonna be wack. And do these n***** even know what franchise mean? What does that word have to do with their name? I'll just start a click called ham & cheese and rap about flip flops and thongs for that matter
I bought this same crib in May of 2005 from Buy Buy Baby and it came in six weeks pretty easy to assemble I did it while I was pregnant. It had no scartches or chips. I like it a lot and my daughter loves it. we havent converted it to a toddler bed or the full bed shes only 2. But its very roomy. It can get dented a little easily as when she banged a toy on it there were some dents but since its in white you dont notice it that much. --- I really like it cuz the quality is superb and we're very very happy with. In fact we bought another one from amazon, for my son. My kids are 12 months apart so we needed another crib for him since now hes 1. He likes it a lot too. But even though company and everything is the same. the crib did come with some damaging to it, but it wasnt that bad, you dont really notice it, we got lucky i guess. But i do plan to just paint over the parts where the white paint has come off. The quality also seems different it doesnt seem as dense as the first one I bought. I dont know whether the manufacturing has changed or its quality issues. But overall its a nice crib I just wish it came in better condition and that it was the same wood feeling as the first one. But its definately worth the buy. AND it came with SUPER FAST SHIPPING with amazon. and the shipping was free too. But its well worth the buy!!!!!! My kids are happy and so im happy!!
The author of the Declaration of Independence and promoter of a bill of rights for the U.S. Constitution, Thomas Jefferson once wrote: "I read no newspaper now but Ritchie's, and in that chiefly the advertisements, for they contain the only truths to be relied on in a newspaper." [Letter to Nathaniel Macon, January 12, 1819] ---  --- The Nation is not a newspaper. Rather it is a weekly compilation of informed opinion and investigative reportage that reports what the main stream press and infotainment TV doesn't dare to. Those Americans whose minds have been addled by a steady stream of ideological propaganda and lies call The Nation "left wing," "liberal," "radical," etc., etc.  ---  --- Plato had written 2,300 years ago his Allegory of the Cave: "Behold! human beings living in an underground den, which has a mouth open towards the light and reaching all along the den; here they have been from their childhood, and have their legs and necks chained so that they cannot move, and can only see before them, being prevented by the chains from turning round their heads." Plato's "punchline" was "...  And if he is compelled to look straight at the light, will he not have a pain in his eyes which will make him turn away to take refuge in the objects of vision which he can see, and which he will conceive to be in reality clearer than the things which are now being shown to him?" ---  --- And so, dear reader The Nation is filled with sunlight that too many Americans cannot stand to look into directly. It is much less painful for them simply to say: "... the Nation's political bias is so far to the Left that it repeatedly errors in its evaluations of the American and world - situation." ---  --- For those who wish to know the simple truth of what is going on in America and the world read The Nation. It prints the patriotic, incisive truth.
I bought one of these to squeege the water out of my past-shoulder-length hair.  It works great!  I gotta admit, it's just big enough for my head and I have a teeny little cranium so normal adults would probably prefer to buy the "extra large" size towel (which isn't really all that large.
I bought this item over a year ago, and it has never served for anything. Once I spotted a deer and turned on the "IR" illuminator, and the deer ran away - not too surprising, it is actually a red light and totally visible for most animals. Better use a flashlight. This is a first-generation nightscope, and has a very small range of utility: If there is a little light, the adapted human eye sees better, and if there is almost no light the device does not see either. 100 bucks is not too much of a waste, but if you are serious about nightvision you should spend about 10 times as much
Having been a teenager once, I can certainly understand the inner turmoil and angst teens experience.  However, in PUMP UP THE VOLUME, the movie's attempt to martyrize teens and make all adults look like uncaring morons only serves to underscore why so many adults look with disdain on teens.  The teens in this movie seem to have little respect for authority and their assignation as to being tortured and misunderstood is vanquished in their juvenile behavior.  Even our hero (well played by Christian Slater) cannot communicate with people on a one to one level; he instead decides to become some kind of salvation to his teens by using his pirated radio shows to cause some kind of uprising among them.  As a proponent of truth, he is a vapid antithesis of truth: he fakes masturbation to arouse the youths; he doesn't use his real name or voice; and on a call with a potential suicide victim, he treats the caller as someone who isn't serious and never really offers any kind of consolation.  The suicidal teen says he is lonely and we automatically assume he is lonely within his familial structure, but isn't he just as lonely with the peers who mourn him after his demise?  The adults are played almost as caricatures and the teens as misunderstood heroes.  Sorry, folks, been there done that...living at any age requires a commitment to better yourself and do what you feel is right.  Questioning authority without any viable alternatives, as none of these teens do, merely escalates the generational gap, and movies like this are merely attempts to exploit the so called misunderstanding of youth
Excellent product...  very difficult to find in stores.  Can safely heat breastmilk and formula in a warmer...  healthier than heating in plastic
This is an inspiring movie to ALL Americans at this stage of the war vs Japan...in reality, 4 of the captured USAAF crew were beheaded, others tortured unmercifuly...3 survived  at war's end...with the release of, "The Purple Heart" at Christmas time [1944] well after the Gen Doolittle raid in April 1942, it hit home and in our hearts to the heroics of our courageous United States Army Air Force and Naval Forces in harm's way...this movie depicts Japan for all of her quick grabs in the Pacific War; yet, Japan was wide open and vunerable to air attack...it helped lift our morale to perservere, sacrifice and no more surrenders, ultimately paving the way for Japan's unconditional surrender forevermore in Aug/1945...it was NOT a propaganda movie; conversely, a cornerstone film for total victory over Japan who was our most formidable and cunning enemy we ever faced on the sea and on the land...Dana Andrews stirring lecture to that Japanese judge rang true as the "USAAF will blackened your skies, day and nite we'll come to burn your cities to the ground and wipe your dirty little Empire off the face of the earth"...that was a TRUISM and justly so...sadly, today's liberal Americans can't relate or comprehend to just what a UNITED effort it took to bring the Japanese Militarists to extinction in Aug/1945...the Japanese got what they readily deserved with A-Bomb interest...this movie was a harbinger of what was to come to the home-islands of Japan...WW2 was a great American lesson to America's enemies...I loved this wartime 1944 film about wartime April/1942....SSGT CHRIS SARNO-USMC FM
This movie came out when I was twelve and I have been in love with it ever since. It brought me, a rural farm kid, the magic of Leonard Cohen, Concrete Blond, Was (Not Was),The Beastie Boys, and all of the other wonderful musicians who grace this film. It also brought me Christian Slater in a role that I would later relate to in a big way as a teen. In short, for reasons all sentimental, I love this film. It may not have cohesiveness in the same way "Heathers" does but it has heart and that is something that teen movies seem to lack these days. So watch this flick and be grateful that you are no longer in high school. I know I do
Thinking. Analyzing. Solving Problems. Reading. Logic. These are just some of the skills that Brain Age will help you develop (or re-develop).  ---  --- No, it's not Resident Evil or Splinter Cell. But it is as fun and addictive; it's certainly as challenging if not more challenging, and it's a nice pallet cleanser from the plethora of pure entertainment value games that my kids and I play. ---  --- Brain Age is a bit advanced at times for my grade schoolers, but the parts that they do get really help them develop the skills that they are concurrently working on in school. Big Brain Academy is a much easier (not better) alternative for younger children. ---  --- There's a daily training area that gives your skills a workout. And there's a test area that challenges you to quickly and accurately work through various tasks, then provides you with a calculation of your Brain Age based on how well you did on the test. Sudoku has it's own area to train the brain on number logic. ---  --- Kids reading this will NO vote me to death for saying this, but this is a great game for parents to get for their kids. It's one of the only ones (Big Brain Academy is the other) that I never take away from my own kids when they've misbehaved or simply just had too much video gaming. They never complain. ---  --- One word of advice: Brain Age has a hard time recognizing an "8" if you write it the way you'd skate a figure 8; it likes it better when you draw an 8 as two circles on top of each other. ---  --- Addictive fun. Buy it.
Be carful where you place it...MUST be put in a shady place or it reads crazy! Hard to read if sun is hitting it and obviously can't be seen at night
  The bar itself is exactly what I wanted.  The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because of the troubles I had on the purchase.  The bar arrived literally hanging out of the box, the box was really, really torn up.  The collars that spin on the ends were not even with the bar, needless to say the bar was useless untill I finally found some collars on ebay.  Amazon refunded all my $$ as soon as they were aware of the problem.  Overall the bar is great
Funny and Witty, this movie will keep you going, especially if you love the play by Oscar Wild
i bought this lip liner 3 times and i was always disappointed because no matter how hard you try to put it on your lips, it just wont glide. you will have to rub it hard on your lips to line em. clinique liners are the worst one in the market
I have ordered this coat 2 times and returned both coats.  I'm very disappointed.  This is supposed to be a reversible coat.  However, the hem of the black side is too long. Consequently it hangs below the hem of the bronze side when reversed.  And, it does not look good at all.  The company needs to revise this pattern
These Crocs are very unique. They have a comfortable footbed that cradles your foot. They are shaped like a Birkenstock, but with closed cell foam instead of cork as the footbed. The closed cell foam is very lightweight but dense so you can walk around in comfort. I wear them just about everyday to work. I chose the closed toe model without the holes in the top because I work in a laboratory where having your feet exposed is not a good idea. The ones with open holes in the top offer more ventilation. And, because Crocs float in water, they make great shoes for boating or kayaking. They drain well and dry out quickly, plus if you do manage to slip one off it will bob along on the surface until you fetch it.  ---  --- I know that a lot of doctors and nurses wear these because they allow you to stand comfortably for hours at a time. They are also great because they can very easily be washed off completely in just a couple of minutes. I wear them when I am gardening too and then just wash all the mud off the shoes with the hose outside. ---  --- In short, the Crocs are comfortable and versatile shoes. Treat your feet and buy them today
I guess this is a bad review owing to bad item description, not bat quality. Turns out, it is NOT a universal ipaq stylus set, so make sure your ipaq is combatible!!
Smooth and easy to use.  Also, easy to run on.  Not quite as portable as I thought it would be, but to have a quality machine I guess it needs to be a little on the large size.
Didn't pump any air into the tire the first 2 "stomps" ... tried it again another day, 3rd "stomp" and the gauge went flying off. Put the gauge back on and it still doesn't work. Biggest waste of money. Never even filled one tir
Maybe its just me but the piano is out of tune badly enough that it should not have been recorded. I had to force myself to finish listening to the concerto and did not even bother with the rest. Sad piece of work
Turns out I don't like in-ear ear phones.  The sound on these is good, though the bass is a bit much in my opinion.  The in-ear style makes me feel deaf to the outside world.  If you do like this style, these are pretty good.
Great SW, easy to learn, and good graphics.  Really helps visualize the space when you can see it 3D.  ---  --- Could be improved if numerous similar objects could be selected and changed simultaneously (e.g., windows, doors, cabinets to get all with the same materials, colors, & hardware rather than one at a time - very labor intensive).  Should warn users to select/create a style and then copy/paste them where needed. ---  --- Also, difficult (maybe impossible, because I haven't figured out how to do it) to change a room's/house's overall style once you start a given design
The picture provided is very disceaving. This product could very well come packaged as a free prize in a box of Lucky Charms. I was planning on giving this to my girlfriend as a gift but was far too ashamed. Stay away, move onto a different product. I will be returning ASAP
This is a nice chain with a durable lobster claw clasp. The diameter is somewhat small, but I will probably order another chain with a larger diameter
Excellent price for the charger. Original Motorola equipment.  Shipping was a little steep for such and inexpensive item.  Shipping was very fast.  I definetly will continue to do business with Amazon and A1 Accessories. Very pleasant and uneventful shopping experience
Have received and reviewed this item. I cranked it for 2 minutes. The radio played no longer than 2-3 minutes then died. I tried to crank it longer - same results. It is useless. It's large and bulky (though very sleek and nice). The cranking handle looks fragile and I suspect with all the cranking this toy needs, it will break sooner than later. Bottom line: Don't buy it. I own another similar product which has a simple look however the radio plays for at least one hour on a 1 - 2 minutes crank
This was one of our worst purchases. Rental gear that we have used on previous vacations works better! The snorkle and mask were constant problems, leaking, filling with water, etc. We had to stop snorkling every few minutes and finally just gave up.
I was a private beta tester for the new OS. I tested the software for a whole year and I am not pleased with it. ---  --- If you depend on stability for your existing software, you are out of luck. The hardware and software support for the new operating system is horrible. Many businesses will have to upgrade their hardware to use Windows Vista.  ---  --- You are better off upgrading to a Mac. After all, Microsoft did steal many ideas from Apple Computers. --- 
First, the directions on assembling this product were in impossible to understand CHINGLISH. 2nd, the gun broke immediately upon use. Hot import toys never answers their phone and never returns calls. THEY WILL NOT HELP YOU. Don't throw your money away on this one
This product is great at exfoliating, not so great at hair removal.  Your skin will be silky smooth, but still have hair.  The hair that is removed doesn't stay gone long.  And it's tricky to maneuver into the curvier parts of your body.  It will definitely have to be used in conjunction with another product. 
I have had this straightener for about a year.  It will get my wavy hair straight but not quickly and I have to use the high heat settings.  Also, my hair does not get stick straight but if your hair is already pretty straight then this is a good straightener
I misunderstood the dimensions listed ( 7.5 x 1.5 x 10.5 inches ) and thought it would be large enough for my mother to see and handle. It isn't. Apparently, the dimensions include the packaging. She loves Wheel Of Fortune on TV, and I thought this game would be terrific therapy for her hands. Very disappointing. I'll be returning it, unopened.
I recently purchased the Stamina Elliptical. It took me a day and a half to put together. The meter didn't work so I called customer service and they sent another one out immediately. It makes a lot of noise and it's not very sturdy. I would return it but it would take too long to dis-assemble. I wouldn't recommend this product. ---  --- 
i first bought this product because the woman at the store said that it renewed the skin, bringing newer skin to the surface.  and she added that it helps pull pimples out to the surface so you can get rid of them easier, i was a little wary a first, but it works.  my skin feels softer and looks more even all around.
I got this as a present, when it finally came back in stock. ---  --- The scrub part of the stick does a great job, but you need to have lips that aren't in dire need of help for it to really work.  To do that, just use a moist, soft toothbrush, and gently scrub.  The scrub side will sometimes leave a little sugar behind, so you might have to wipe your lips off a little after you use it, but I found that this doesn't happen all the time. ---  --- The balm side goes on smoothly, and feels great.  It's silky feeling, but does not provide a lot of moisture, so, if you lips are on the dryer side,  this is not going to replace your regular gloss. ---  --- This stuff is great for on the go, and I will be buying it again when mine runs out
We bought this - on cassette - in Washington DC on our first day of honeymoon in September 1997. Having flown from Northern Ireland, it provided us with the perfect honeymoon soundtrack as we drove from  Washington to Nashville, along the Skyline drive, down through South West  Virginia, across Eastern Kentucky to Berea, and down to Smoky Mountains  National Park in Tennessee. We are from an Ulster-Scots/Scotch-Irish  background, and during those three weeks we fell in love with the land that  our forebears had settled in so many centuries before, bringing thier  fiddles and folk songs with them, creating what was the core of mountain  old-time music and bluegrass. From the Carter Family right through, every  song is a classic. You must buy this
Solid construction, good optics, nice sound.  As mentioned by others, the output for the USB transfer is found in the handycam console and not the camera itself...a minor annoyance.  All in all, this is a good camera that is touch pricy but you do get what you pay for....
I myself is a Proform treadmill customer and tortured by their customer services. I also found some reviews on the internet mentioning their machines broke down in several months after purchase. (Mine in three months.) The strategy of the customer service is basically make wild guesses of what went wrong and send you the parts asking you to replace it by yourself. (In one occasion, they even asked me to take off the motor and find a local garage to test the motor to see if it's good.)These back-and-forth guessing games normally drag on for months, and eventually they claim the warranty expired and they can no longer serve you, even though it's still within one year. --- I believe you are looking for a treadmill for exercise, not to practice your debate skill over the phone with some customer service keep saying: "this is our policy.
These slippers are typical of Daniel Green products, beautiful, comfortable and affordable. --- Thank
This movie is the best b movie I have ever seen. I have seen a lot but this one has it all
I was hoping that "Socermania" would be on the "Extreme Sports Fun" DVD but NO! Instead disney had to put on all of the same cartoons that were released on the "Disney Treasures" this also goes for the other two DVD's Extreme Music and adventure fun, allthough 'Pluto's Blue Note', 'Donald's Dilemma' 'No Sail' 'Old Sequoia' and 'Trailer Horn' are on DVD for the first time but with the new Disney Treasures "Disney Rarities" and "The Chronological Donald volume 2"(which might I add could use a lot of improvment on the restoration) who needs these DVDs, so I suggest not to buy these cheap DVD's and buy the Treasures in spite of the bad restoration
The kit was great I thought it was soo much fun to paint the puppies different colors! This toy is really cool because you can hang your puppies,put magginets on them or just play with them! This toy is pretty durable but if you slammed it really hard on a hard floor it would probally break.If you like craft kits you should deffinatly get this one
If you're looking to get your first smoker, look no further.  Since it's a horizontal-style smoker, it can also double as a BBQ pit/charcoal grill.  Plenty of room, very versatile.  Treat it well and it will give you a decade of use. ---  --- The reason I can't give it 5 stars is because of the thickness of the metal.  If it were a little thicker, there would be much more heat retention.  You can buy smokers with 1/4"+ thickness, but expect to pay at least $600. ---  --- This is easily the best smoker in its price range. ---  --- Make sure you season the inside of the smoker similar to how you would season a cast iron pan.  As with any smoker, before use, paint the interior of the smoker with shortening or vegetable oil, then start up the smoker and let it smoke for a couple or few hours. ---  --- Also, you should almost always keep the chimney vent all the way open.  Use the intake vent on the firebox for temperature control. 
I registered for these bottles I am a new mom and thought the variety was great. We used the stage one nipple and my son was able to suck down his formula with no problem infact way to quick. He would struggle with feeding time. He was so gassy and had horrible reflux, that during feeding he would arch his back stffin his body and cry. I did have a recommendation to switch to the Dr. Brown bottles which made a huge diffrence. However, he was still spiting up and still a little gassy just not as bad and it was managable, their stage 1 nipples were to small and the stage two were to big. We had gone on a camping trip and I bought the Playtex disposable bottles for easier cleaning. I also had done some research on these bottles and found several people liked them better then the Dr. Brown. So I tried them and my son is doing much better he dosen't even spit up anymore. So if you like the ventair I think you would like the disposable much better. My sons Dr. wanted to put him on an antacid but I was not comfortable with giving him medication at such a young age I wanted to see if I could solve the problem, which I have done completly with the Playtex disposable bottles!
We had to clean this high chair nearly every day and the process itself would take 30 minutes. I am not a neat freek in any way shape or form. But you kind of have to clean this frequently as the food goes into every nook and cranny. If i had to buy another chair I would get a wood one. We have the Eddie Bauer booster now that our son is older. We clean that once a day with a sponge which takes all of 1 minute and take the cushion off for a super clean once a week. --- The Prima Pappa is comfortable and secure. In the end I realized that we didn't need all the bells and whistles
Very moisturizing, and smells nice too.  The sea minerals and exfoliating ingredients keep my cuticles looking good and help cut down on hangnails, too.  I apply lots of it at bedtime
My 2 year old saw this in BJs and kept asking for it, so Santa brought it for him for Christmas. I think it's a good first guitar. He loves to strum it, but he definitely needs to be supervised to teach him to respect that it is a special musical instrument, not a toy. So far he has sat on it and used it as a drum and it's held up fine, but I don't think it would hold up with such continued abuse. It is recommended for children much older than he is, so I can't expect anything different. I do wish they made a smaller version of it so it would be more comfortable for him. For a better price than I see at Amazon, you can get a small Hohner guitar at a music store, which might be better quality, I'm not sure. Regardless, I am very happy with this guitar and I would recommend it for any child who shows a real interest in music. I would not buy it for a child just as a toy, unless you don't mind it being destroyed. I am planning to buy the guitar strap and will review that when I get it
The wrong item was mailed to me. I checked the order after I recieved the item to make sure it wasn't a mistake on my part, and it wasn't. I recieved an armband for an iPod nano and I ordered an armband for an iPod video. Luckily I was able to sell it to a friend of mine instead of having to send it back.
We originally set this gym up for our son when we moved into our new house, and had nowhere to put him (he was 3 weeks old).  As time went on, it just became convient to put him on the mat, close to us.  It was really fun to watch him grow into all the toys!  He started by just swinging his arms, and finally has learned to grab and interact with the toys!  He loves the star in the middle.  He could spend all day talking to that thing alone!  He loves this gym so much that we take it everywhere we go.  I highly suggest this gym for any baby!  It is something that us or the baby couldn't live without
Back in the day (1970's) these were made with a stiff, strong PLASTIC, rigid "insert" w/ the poly-rope outside. This gave the "leash" a realistic, "tight but curved under own weight" appearance, & a believable / realistic "bounce" to the "dog" with the most imperceptible wrist action on the part of the "dog walker". HOWEVER, THIS PIECE OF CRAP has a thick soft wire inside the leash, and this gives the leash a very phony, fake-looking, too-heavy, all bent-up look. PIECE OF JUNK PIECE OF JUNK PIECE OF JUNK !
The first novel of Laurell K. Hamilton's Merry Gentry series is not, actually, that terrible a book. It's by far the best in a not particularly great series, actually. What made it almost impossible for me to read is that the basic premise, the set-up, is one of the most grotesquely, ridiculously stupid things I've ever read.  ---  --- Princess Meredith NicEssus has fled Faerie, in fear of death at the hands of her aunt, Andais, the Queen of Air and Darkness and ruler of the Unseelie Court. High profile fae in this world are major public figures, like rock stars or the royal family of England. The sudden disappearance of one of the Unseelie royals is a very big deal indeed. Every news media in the world reports the story....and it never goes away. We are told solemnly that reports of Princess Meredith being spotted are right up there with Elvis sightings. Meredith's image, the story of her mysterious disappearance, is everywhere. I mean, neolithic pygmies living in deepest Africa know who Meredith is, and what she looks like.  ---  --- Meanwhile, Princess Meredith has disguised herself as a mortal private eye. Thing is, she hasn't disguised herself very much at all. Her supernaturally pale skin is now humanly pale skin. Her fae red hair is now human red hair. Her facial features remain the same. And with everyone on the planet wondering where is Princess Meredith, for years on end, no one recognizes her. Let me hasten to add, there is no magic involved in this, they honestly simply don't recognize her. And the crowning touch to this masterful disguise, the name chosen for her pseudonym to hide the fact she's actually Princess Meredith is....wait for it....Merry Gentry.  ---  --- Jesus wept.  ---  --- And for years, none of her co-workers, no one who knows her, says to themself, "Hey, wait a minute, that women who looks almost exactly like Princess Meredith....Merry Gentry....Princess Meredith....oh my God, Merry Gentry is Princess Meredith!" Nope, she's just incognito, baby.  ---  --- At which point I almost threw down the book and said, "You have GOT to be kidding me." It's absolutely amazing to me this made it through the editing process. Do Laurell Hamilton's editors do anything other than rubber stamp her writing? Given her past six or eight novels, including this one, I'm tempted to say: no, actually
Having only owned Fossil watches prior to this one I must say that I was a little jaded.  My latest Fossil bit the dust after many long, good years of use.  I happened to find this just browsing one day and was hooked by the color and overall design.  I have to say, I was highly impressed with what I received.  It is an absolutely beautiful watch
After waiting for 1 month to get this toy I cannot tell you HOW disappointed my 7 year old daughter was when she got it. Absolutely this thing is a WASTE of money! ---  --- It is poorly designed and there is no way you can trace from it. The image is impossible to see with any amount of detail. ---  --- DO NOT BUY THIS TOY! I would give it zero stars if I could
This camera is very similar to the Fuji F30, but has face detection (fd) that autofocuses on faces in a photo.  Great for taking pictures of yourself, or for snapshots you don't have time to compose.  Excellent quality photos in dim light. At 3200 ISO, photos are washed out and noisy, but still good for capturing an image you would otherwise miss. Option to limit ISO to 1600, or to 400. Camera will use any speed up to the limit. 400 ISO is extremely good. As good as my Canon Digital Rebel xti. Usual modes I never use (flower, landscape, etc.), but one unique mode I use all the time: no flash/flash. The camera takes a picture without flash up to 3200 ISO, and then takes a picture with flash immediately after. Usually takes less than one second to capture both images. No flash doesn't surprise anyone and ruin the candid shot, while the following flash guarantees you'll get the image, even if the "warm glow of candlelight" is ruined. I always have the camera set to this mode. Uses xD cards, which I hate, but if you buy a 1 GB card you'll be able to take 400 - 500 photos without ever needing to change the card. Also, battery life is unbelieveable! Fully charge the camera over several hours, and you'll be able to take 400 photos, half with flash, before the battery is drained. Fuji-brand underwater housing is optional, watertight to 40m (121 ft.) Camera comes with underwater setting to intensify non-blue colours, and still keep the intense blue of the water. Literally *every* diver should have one of these cameras. I recommend this camera without hesitation. There simply isn't anything else like it on the market. --- 
The powder/foundation is excellent for skin which is oily and large-pored. --- It is one of the best around for no-caking, no-oil, smooth surface skin. --- If you can't stand the feel of cream or lotion foundations, Chanel does it best!! --- Also, my seller was terrific
All I have had with this product is problems. the clip in the middle, kept popping open, even when it the wallet was close and my money would fall out, so i ended up removing the cheap clip and useing it for what ever. don't waste your money
Since this is one of my top four all-time favorite films and I love films passionately, I am ABSOLUTELY beside myself in fury and anger at the HORRIBLE packaging on this magnificent film. I could forgive the lack of extras. I know A LOT of people working for these international movie conglomerates don't give a damn about the Classics (or even movies in general, really). But the lack of thought that went into the packaging of this truly great, PERFECT, scene-by-scene-, shot-by-shot, movie is STAGGERING. Not only do they include a throwaway line of dialog in the middle of the images, not only do they clutter it up with a bunch of extras from a scene in the boxing ring... they picture the villianess, not the heroine, with the hero ! Where is the original poster art !!!!! THe insert art !!! The half sheet art !!! The reissue art !!! There . isnt . even . a . booklet . . or . flyer . inside . NOTHING ! This looks like a release that belongs in the cheapie bin with the public domain stuff . Columbia Pictures.. I am shouting . At . YOU 
I got this swing And I will be talking it back. I put it on 5 and It will not move. I don't know what it would be like with the baby in it. I just tryed it. 
If you're going to play Karaoke Revolution, this is the mic for you.  I now have 2 so that my wife and I can play in duet mode.  It's much better than the headset.  For just 17 bucks, you can have a 'real' mic that feels so much more natural.  If you play KR a lot, invest in this microphone
very efficiently drains about as much milk as I can get with the Pump in Style Advanced for me, and very portable and easy to clean. I use it when I have a little more time or when I don't expect to pump more than a couple ounces (between feedings). Despite Medela's warnings, I would say you could use this to pump daily, aslong as you  are careful to fully drain the breast (massage), but maybe not okay for maintaining supply for multiple pumping in a row
This is a great finisher - use after you've drenched your hair with leave-in conditioner, and focus on the ends which tend to spread out and fly away and the little wispies at your temple and nape.  Smells great but doesn't compete with the smell of other products.  Only con: a little bit does NOT go a long way.  It's expensive to stock up
Years ago when the Diaper Genie first hit the market. I was given one as a gift for my baby shower. It did not work the way I thought it would. The Genie was supposed to dispose of the diapers by sealing them so that no odor would be present. This was not the case. The smell seemed to linger in the room longer then just disposing of the diapers as normal in the trash. Also the smell that the Genie left after opening the Genie to dispose of the long tied knots of diapers was horrible. I had to clean it several times just to get the smell out. Needless to say when I had my second child and once again received one. It remained in the box and it still sits in the box after five years. I would definitely not recommend this item for new moms. Too much hassle
The work table is plain wood, not sealed.  There is a warning on the bottom not to let it stay wet.  Since a charcoal grill must be used outside, I don't think the price justifies the limitations
My son loved these jeans.  The jeans were very comfortable. The best thing about them was that because my son is so thin the elastic adjustments were perfect
It cost 3 times its price just to ship, I didn't really expect to be amazed, but it is sturdy, if plain. The sheath doesn't really make it a decent wall display, but I think it will out last any cheap show sword
 I got this movie in a three DVD pack from a local dealer, it came along with the movies Eaten Alive and Massacre in Dinosaur Valley.  I'd have to say that all three movies were worth the $15 dollars I spent on the three-pack.  The movie, Jungle Holocaust, is an adventure movie in a different spin.  I dont really consider this a horror movie, at least in the conventional sense.  The movie is exceptionally well done in the development of cinematography, the storyline is interesting and the acting and er...scenes...are engrossing (to use a phrase).  What I would really call this is an anthropological adventure to the extreme...a civilized man placed in a totally uncivilized surroundings.  Communications are not what you would get off the local street corner, worldviews are nonexistent (at least to the tribe in this film), so there is no connection except savagery.  Maybe this movie would have a greater tie with Golding's "Lord of the Flies."  A fascinating movie that brings you to the heart of a world that we, especially in first world countries like the US, have forgotten about.  I would suggest "End of the Spear" as a Christian look at examining these prehistoric people.  That film isn't a horror film, it is a Christian film, but it is (as I am a Christian) an interesting exploration of meeting such tribal people on their own territory. 
I just bought this seat for my 9 month old son. I bought it for the convenience of the fold down front. As good as that feature is it still causes red marks on my sons knees. He is a thin baby so I don't know how well this would work for a chubbier baby. Also, the seat it self is slippery. I have to place a rag down before I put the baby in because he will slide forward if I don't. This is very uncomfortable for him.Unfortunately, this seems to be the only seat with the fold down front which does make taking the baby in and out easier. That is really the only good thing I can say about this product.
Ok. Now I know I'm not the brightest star in the sky but whodathunk that when the game calls for you to 'blow', while stewing or boiling something, that you are actually supposed to blow into the mic! I failed at so many recipes just because I didn't know what to do when the recipe called for 'blowing'. Yes, I know what you are saying, "Did you read the instructions before you played the game?" Of course not! This game appears juvenile and primative, but it has proven to me at least, to be the most advanced NDS game to date. Even if you don't enjoy puzzle games or you are a Teen/Mature gamer, this game is worth owning just to experience the full capabilities of your DS. I'd hate to know what the Mature Game Developers are doing with this whole 'blow' thing. Yuck
This was my fisrt foray into lip scrubs.  I like the dual concept, with a scrub on one side and a lip balm on the other.  I also like the fact, this slips into you purse or pocket easily, so it's convenient for those on the go.  I took mine skiing in Vail, and it was the first time I didn't come home with chapped lips.  ---  --- The textures are good.  The scrub side is slightly grainy, more of a polish than a scrub.  I would not recommend it for heavily chapped lips, but it works well for weekly maintenance. The lip balm side is a little waxy, but moisturizing with vityamin e.  It's quite long-lasting and provides a sweet, natural shine.  This smells of spun vanilla, sweet and sugary.  ---  --- Why only 4 stars?  I think Tarte should have added SPF 15 sun protection.  Doing so would provide sweet, kissable lips and the protection you need
I only needed this for school a little while back. Now I am marketing in Hawaii at a resort and realizing this book taught me little to nothing. Have fun with it if you please though
The text gets 5 stars for the orientation, organization, and the on-line resources for the text. It describes exactly what you would want in an Applied Corporate Finance course. Unfortunately, I have to deduct 3 stars because the text contains too many typos and smple calculations which I specifically want my students not to make. This has been frustrating for my students, as well as myself. However, I am confident that when this problem is cleaned up, the book will be among the best Applied Corporate Finance text in the market. I strongly recommend a new, corrected edition
My bike did not come with an instruction manual. This seems to be a recurring problem with this company
I have only had this phone for a few days now but I have used every feature it has to offer. I must say that this is the best phone I have ever owned. The only real problem I have is that my fat fingers sometimes hit buttons I didn't intend but it's really not that big of a deal; I just need to re-train my hands. I am happy with the picture quality as well as video quality. The audio options are great for me as all I really wanted to be able to do is load my own songs on to use as ringtones and Motorola made this a pretty simple task
Great flavor, light and fluffy, and good texture. Only down side is that the bread tends to dissolve with to much moisture, and has a tendency to be a little dry but great for sandwiches. Unlike other gluten-free breads that tend to be so heavy that they over power anything you put in the middle.
Excellent product - very ergonomic, easy to set up and use! Wireless works great. --- I would recommend this product
I really like this bike. It feels like a bike from the '50s but with all the modern technology. The look is great and draws a lot of attention. It is somewhat simple to complete the bike since it arrives mostly put together but the assembly instructions are the worst I have ever seen with any product. I basically got no clue from the instructions on how to finish off the bike, it is hard to believe how poorly they are written. I was beginning to believe they sent me the wrong directions. After I got it together through trial and error the brakes and the shifter were way out of whack and I had to spend $30 at a local bike shop to get these items adjusted; the instructions for making the adjustment did not work. The guys at the bike shop took two attempts to get it right (two trips for me) and they were wondering why it was so difficult to adjust. After all that was done I love the bike and it rides nicely and when properly adjusted, shifts and brakes very nicely. The ride is comfortable and I love the seat and location of the handlebars. I would recommend the bike for all the fun and looks it has but be prepared for some hassle to get it right unless you are one of the lucky ones who gets one that is adjusted correctly out of the box. My suggestion is for the manufacture of this bike to fire the idiot who wrote the assembly instructions and hire someone with some writing skills. I also do not understand why the brakes and shifter were so far out of adjustment; did no one test the bike before they boxed it up
Most green teas have a grassy, astringent taste to them but this tea is unbelievably smooth and slightly sweet.  Highly recommended, as are all of Rishi's "Ancient Tree" teas
I have tryed the Almond Crunch and is delicious and healthy snack better than chips Try it you'll agre
I would argue that since we really haven't evolved all that far since our primate days human males still have loads of aggression and animalistic behavior they need to get out. And despite the best efforts from civilization in general to neuter them that aggression still has to go someplace. In Mary Harron's "American Psycho" it comes out in all the wrong places. The film is a character study of one Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale), a Wall Street yuppie by day and an ax murderer by night. Patrick is a man who has been forced to the edge because of the fakeness that surrounds him. It's not just the suits and the empty conversations either. It is the peeing contests over who has the best haircut or apartment or business card. He tries to talk about his problems, he really does, but nobody listens to him because nobody listens period. To their ears "Murders and Executions" is interchangeable with "Mergers and Acquisitions."  ---  --- The film is a big punch in the face to the egotistical businessmen of the 1980's. This particular Gordon Gekko is overdone and overacted by Christian Bale in a great performance. He is robotic, phony, arrogant and absurd. He is the kind of guy who will have a 3 some with prostitutes just so that he can admire himself in the mirror doing so (all the while flexing his biceps). More than anything he is militantly materialistic. He is Dexter mixed with Jim Profit, only he likes to style and profile while taking an ax to a co-workers head. The whole point, which is made clear in the final scene, is that while these people may truly believe that only the glossy veneer matters it is really the inside that counts. Just because these people make enough cash to swim in, Scrooge McDuck style, doesn't mean that their behavior is excusable. Harron paints the modern businessman as an American Psycho, and it is all too fitting. To make it in the business world your conscious and your soul must be turned off, you must be turned into Patrick Bateman. ---  --- The film is a great success. As a horror movie villain Patrick has one of the most compelling backstories ever. Every scene has great energy to it and even though Bale looks a little out of place his acting is so good you can't stop watching him. There is something of a conflict presented when Willem Dafoe shows up to play a detective on the case of one of Patrick's murders. That storyline is interesting while it lasts, but it is never quite wrapped up. I would also admit that after awhile I got a little sick of swimming in these debaucherous waters. He may never tire of having it dirty and bloody but I eventually did. The character is endlessly fascinating (what is up with his love of cheesy 80's music?) and the scene where he kills Paul Allen will leave you stunned and hypnotized. The male need for aggression isn't going anyplace and we need to find a good way to channel it. . .otherwise we are going to have a lot more Patrick Bateman's and Iraq Wars on our hands. ***3/
I guess i'm to dumb to purchase an item like this.  I followed the instructions to the letter and it's not working. I guess I should have read the small print.  Sent an e-mail to Xitel for help and waiting for response. Will re-rate later.  
Should have believed all the other negative reviews.  Didn't work in my Honda Civic and didn't work in my Nissan Altima, both with original manufacturer tape decks.  In both cases, the tape deck whirred for a bit, then ejected the SmartDeck
I thought these were very good quality considering the price. I like them better than the one I bought at BRU that cost much more
I was treated to this sauce while in Canada for a friends wedding recently.  I have to say, it is easily the best steak/brown sauce I've ever had - it's sweet and tangy and spicy all at the same time, but not overpoweringly so.  The sauce seems extremely versatile and would be excellent over steak, poultry, burgers, fries - and I'm sure would be a fantastic marinade as well
Like the fading in of light.  Would like the sound effects...if they worked!  Out of box the sound effects did not work. Now have to mess with calling the manufacturer to fix or get it replace.  Such a hassle
There are so many great things about this that I don't know where to start.  Availability--price--shipping--the list goes on and on.  Bottom line is that my daughter is a big Care Bear fan and it's impossible to find this bear anywhere else.  It arrived quickly, was just as described (in fact it was softer) and occupies a place of honor on my daughter's bed.  I give it a 5, only because that's the highest.  Makes a wonderful gift!!
This video is awsome if you dont like this video then you CAN'T be t true Pantera fan. It doesnt get any better than this except for live. Watch it Go!!!
as with all of Zucchero's CD's, this is also wonderful.  I listen to it all the time, it's sensual and sexy and great
Decadent stories to warm you up on a cold winters night. Just the right amount of comedy and sexiness blended together for the right recipe for love.  ---      "Warm and soothing, sweet and sensual, these luxurious love stories will melt your cares away, and fulfill your most delectable dreams..." the quote on the back of the book hits the mark. ---      These stories all share a love of chocolate and chemistry. Although the stories may seem short and rushed at times, we must remember, it is an anthology and many feel that way. Each story is a nice little break from the ordinary. ---      Hope you enjoy this book as much as I did. Lori Foster and Suzanne Forster deliver their best as always
I have owned the WMR-968 for several years now and have spent more on 'replacement' parts than if I had bought an entire new unit.  Primarily, the solar transmitter on the rain gauge continually fails to bring the charge up to enough power for the transmitter to transmit back to the base.  I have replaced this transmitter unit three times (twice with the 'new' style).  Living in the Phoenix area, we don't run into too many cloudy or rainy days, but as soon as it doesn't get sunlight for any length of time, the display reads all dashes (not receiving a signal).  So when it rains here, I usually don't get a reading of how much because this thing stops working.  The anemometer is mounted on the same pole just above the rain gauge with the both of the solar transmitters also mounted on the same pole.  The anemometer works consistently and fine.  Both OS and the local distributor say the distance is too far, the unit must have gone bad and needs replacement, etc.,etc.  Replacing the solar unit didn't help and the distance can't be too far for one unit and not the other.  No one can help with this issue.  So my suggestion would be to spend the extra bucks and get something more reliable. 
The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen was based on a pretty good graphic novel and as a movie, its pretty good itself.  Where else  could you ever hope to see the likes of Captain Nemo, Dorin Gray, Mina Harker, the Invisible Man, Dr. Jeckyl/Mr. Hyde, Allan Quatermain & Tom Sawyer all in the same movie?  About the only character the production is lacking is Sherlock Holmes. ---  --- The action and special effects in this movie are outstanding as are the performances from most of the actors.  The only real drawback is the length.  About 30 minutes could be excised from this movie without deleting any key scenes.   ---  --- All in all, a good popcorn flick. 
This product is a piece of garbage.When it works, it does what it is suppose to do. However, it worked for the first two weeks and then totally died on me.Do not buy this product
I honestly don't know why everybody is so negative regarding this game.  I think it's phenominal!  Great missions, great story and game play, and the variety in the weapon customization feature makes for fun little side quests. Overall it's a great addition to the FFVII universe and I definitely hope to see more games with these characters coming out soon!  Even a remake of the original FFVII would be grand! ---  --- On the whole, Vincent Valentine is one bad dude!  The bosses are interesting and cool, and the links to the original game are awesome!   ---  --- If you're a fan, buy this game.  If you're not a fan and want to have an interesting gaming experience, the please consider this title.   ---  --- The Timewarrior has spoken
-This camara picture quality is Nice, and depend on user purpose. My gf is kinda satify with it. --- -Function is easy to use. --- -Battery life is so so.  --- -Battery charger design is not convenience. You have the put the battery into the batter charger. recommand to get a cradle charger, but extra cost. It should sell with cradle charger. --- 
Podría ser extraño regalar una prenda de ropa íntima, pero estos Boxer son lo máximo para regalar desde un primo hasta a un compañero de estudios, y claro para la pareja - e incluso para chicas. Son de algodón, muy suaves frescos y ligeros. Los compré talla M y auqnue son para un caballero delgado uno M de Medio llenito los puede usar con comodidad. Para mi gusto son un poco largos, pero eso también provee de comodidad a su usuario. esto es más que una prenda de ropa interior es algo que provoca lucir y ver lucir. El estampado fue toda una celebración "Saluda a mi pequeño amigo"!!!!!!, con este Boxer puedes pasearte en interiores en tu casa y a nadie le va a molestar
This is some great Coffee:)   Perks you up & gets you moving.  A good tasting, highly energized morning wake up:)  Even better as an afternoon pick me up.  Even thinking about making coffee now just wakes me up
Extremely reliable, easy to read, looks like the Rolex style, only it is very lightweight. Good for everyday use because you can wear either gold or silver jewelry with this watch. I would have given it 5 stars if it were one of those models which does not need a battery
I had bought a bra of this model at a discount store, just got lucky.  It quickly became my favorite, and I was glad to find it at Amazon. 
This watch is very attractive. However, the clasp is not stable and it has fallen off my arm several times. I rarely wear it as a result and am always surprised it's still there when I do. With a more stable clasp, this would be a 4-Star watch -- but this problem is severe enough that it makes the watch worthless to me (hence, 1 star)
My daughter rec'd this game as a gift for her fourth birthday.  It was wonderful because my son, who was two could play it too (with my assistance of course).  Now they are 5 and 7 and still play it.  It is a simple game that requires no reading skills and reinforces counting.  I would recommend it to everyone
Did not do what it says it does.  Only thing this does is remove large scratches.  No matter how many times you put this stuff on the small scratches are still.  Plus it leaves crusty white stuff on the disc and smears.  Not sure if discs are better before or after the application of this stuff.  I guess you get what you pay for.  Wait no you don't.  All I got was a jewel case, two pads, and two tiny packets of solution.  What a rip off.  Didn't even get a manual.  What kind of advertisement is this?  I know, the black market kind
If I had to choose a fragrance that was THE most feminine I've ever smelled, it would be Marc Jacobs.  Yes, it's a gardenia based scent, but definitely not your typical musty, heavy gardenia by any means.  Marc Jacobs is different in that it is a 'wet gardenia', like you're smelling a bunch of gardenias that have been swirling around in a bowl of fresh water.  Intoxicatingly alluring. ---  --- The notes of this fragrance are: Gardenia, Wild Muguet, Skin Musk, Cedar, Ginger.  The gardenia in this is faint, but lovely.  It isn't a knock-you-out strong gardenia, but very mellow and mesmerizing.  It'll follow you like a breath of fresh air, and you'll have people sniffing the air you leave behind. :)  If you've ever smelled Michael by Michael Kors, this is DIFFERENT.  Michael is not gardenia, but it is a tuberose scent.  It is very strong, creamy, heavy, and thick.  If you like Michael, you may like Marc Jacobs as your spring/summer alternative.  They're in the same family in terms of florals and such, but different in terms of how they wear.  Marc Jacobs being flowy, and Michael being heavy.   ---  --- The 1.7 oz. retails at $65, and the 3.4 oz. at $85.  It's quite expensive, but it does have that brand-name smacked on the front. :)  I think it's worth it.  The lasting power is decent.  Even when you may feel it is gone, it's not, and people will compliment you. ---  --- Try it out and see how you like it on your skin
I ordered this clock for my Dad and he loves it. It is so easy to see the time on the ceiling and it keeps the correct time automatically. The indoor temp. is a nice addition. And the price is right
$80 for this?  Seriously overpriced.  If you can find something cheaper buy it, this is not worth 80 bucks.  Clamps were not capable of holding a small boneless ham without slipping.  Worked well with ribs
Item arrived quickly and was exactly as advertised, charges the phone in about 15 minutes of driving
"When was the last time you actually bought a ticket to see a movie, you actually paid your own money to see it?" --- "Last night, Pasedena. The Bicycle Thief." --- "It's an art movie. It doesn't count. We're talking about movie movies." ---  --- Robert Altman is one of my favorite directors, mainly for the way he finds insight in the most inane actions or phrases. This short exchange has many layers when taken out of context and many more when taken in context. With this dialog, The Player reveals exactly why Hollywood movies don't make the money they should. Not because they don't make quality films, but because when a good movie does make money, it doesn't count because it's not a "movie movie." If he stopped to really listen to what was being said, he would've seen that art films have a great drawing power and actually don't cost much to make. But people still wonder why the modern film industry is suffering. ---  --- Wait, there's more. The people in the room don't know it, but producer Griffin Mill, in a fit of paranoia, killed an unemployed screenwriter outside the theater that night. He was being stalked by a writer, but he blamed (and murdered) the wrong one. Now he's still being stalked, still in danger of losing his job, and the cops suspect him of murder. Not a good week for Mister Mill. ---  --- As the conversation presses on, Mill's potential replacement passes around a newspaper, telling people to read random headlines to be made into scripts. Mill spots the story on his murder which we're already watching play out in a movie. ---  --- Yes, it's that type of movie, the self-referential Hollywood movie about Hollywood movies that keeps teasing itself for the viewers' enjoyment. We've seen it about a thousand times before (or since): Get Shorty, Adaptation, Wes Craven's New Nightmare, even certain elements of 8 1/2. There's really nothing too special about it, but this one has much more subtlety and is much more believable. Pay close attention to the ending scene, and think about what words they're using opposed to what they're really saying. ---  --- There's really only one word for a film like this: "Clever!
I am absolutely addicted to this lip gloss. I own over 300 different brands of gloss, and this is by far one of my favorites. It's a pretty good deal, at only $28 for so many colors. I like the small size because it easily fits into any evening bag or pocket. It's fun to layer the different colors as well, and there are an infinate amount of combonations between all of the different colors and flavors. They also taste amazing, each embodying a yummy taste exactly like sugar. It goes especially well with the Aquolina Pink Sugar fragrance, for a sugar-themed cosmetic experience
My daughter just about flipped when she received this toy as a birthday gift!  So immediately after the party, my husband went aboutputting it together.  My five year old played with this for all of about 30 seconds before a piece came off.  We've had it for about two weeks now, and EVERY time you touch this thing, some peice comes off.  No one plays with it.  It's just too much of a hassle to keep together.   My advice - but something else
Even though it works just fine like Ipod Ipod sock, it's quite disappointed that this is not a genuine one. It's acceptable thoug
I first read about this wonderful book on one of the services that provides reading guides for book clubs.  I was intrigued by the premise, and knew I had to buy it.  This is one book that did not let me down!  I was captivated from the moment I began.  I read in greed, hungering for the next diary entry.  I completed it much too quickly, and had to re-read some entries.  I found myself wondering about some of the women.  (Many are still on my mind.)  I am so pleased that book two is in the works.  This is a book that is too good to miss. 
One thing which mystifies me is how few people have embraced the latest in modern clock technology: radio controlled clocks which keep exact time by automatically synchronizing themselves with signals broadcast from the incredibly accurate U.S. atomic clock in Boulder Colorado. Such clocks are not only always accurate to a fraction of a second, they also automatically set themselves to and from daylight savings and standard time as appropriate. Furthermore, such clocks are typically quite reasonable in price. Yet while most Americans have, for example, the latest in modern cordless phones and cell phones, relatively few have the accuracy and convenience of radio controlled clocks. This model is just one of many styles sold by Amazon and other vendors. Try one and I think you'll be glad you did. My wife and I have several of these clocks throughout our house and take accurate time for granted, no what time system is in effect
This is the first of a great series of books. Knights & squires, quests & fairies, action & discovery ---- old stories re-told in an easy-to-read style with a dose of dry humor. Geared towards older children (my daughter LOVES them all), they don't insult the intelligence of the reader (I enjoyed them more than much of the "grown-up" fiction I read). The series is best when you read them in order, as you meet the characters again in future books. The books were such a hit, I actully purchased them in hardback (gasp!) so that the rest of my kids can read & re-read them as they get older. We're eagerly waiting for the 7th book (and the 8th...) to come out in print! ---  --- John Morris (no relation to author
I bought this scale because I figured the price was right.  Well, as they say, you get what you pay for. ---  --- First of all, it is flimsy in construction.  I am under 200 lbs., yet when I step on it, the cheap plastic bends down.  You can just feel how thin and unsubstantial the plastic is. ---  --- Next, the first time I weighed myself, I found that I had lost 7 lbs. overnight!  If only this were true.  I didn't believe it.  I stepped off and got back on and I had gained back 5 of the lost pounds.  Off and on again -- and I was up another 4. ---  --- If you like to just kind of average your many readings, then this scale will work for you.  Otherwise, take a pass. ---  --- BTW, and I was using it on a flat hard surface.
Look, I dig stand up, and I dig fat jokes, but this guy isn't that great. ---  --- I got a friend who loves John Pinette, but I can't see it. ---  --- He tells jokes about how fat he is, how he likes to eat, how he doesn't like to move.  Its the same over and over and over again.  Its dull and it's too easy.  They're not even jokes, really, just comments on how fat he is. ---  --- Also a fair part of his act consists of "asian people talk with accents and thats funny" which I find cheap.  Stereotypes shouldn't be jokes, and even when they are, they shouldn't be THE joke.  John says something with broken english and the audience laughs really hard.  Why?  Why is that funny, here in the 20th century? ---  --- Maybe I just don't "get" his humor, but I don't think this guy is any good.  I perfer comedians who tell jokes. ---  --- On the plus side, this guy is clean, which is rare these days.  But there are better clean comedians around.   Try getting a Brian Regan album or an Emo Philips album.  Jerry Seinfelds album is good too.  Try those guys because they're clean and legitimately funny
I was looking forward to another Oprah magazine with great joy.  Unfortunately, the pomp and circumstance within "O at Home"'s pages is a real turnoff for me, an average, middle-class American living, as they say in "middle America". ---  --- Although I hesitate to say this in print, it's been in my head for ahile now.  I am a faithful 20-year Oprah viewer but something has begun to change in her attitude and it is evidenced in this new magazine.   ---  --- Is it possible that Oprah has not only forgotten her roots, but has now skipped over all the stages in between her roots and now living in a gazillion-square-foot house in Malibu?  Is it possible that she has forgotten the 90% of us who live somewhere in between?  If this magazine is an indication, then sadly, she has
Lovely. Fast shipping. No problems with fastenings or construction at all. Have ordered the bench & 4 chairs too & look forward to them all arriving & being together on the deck. 2 chairs have arrived so far & they are great. Table even comes with touch up paint
The light came without the batteries that were supposed to be included.  Batteries were very difficult to find and quite expensive.  Even with batteries the xenon light did not work.  So now I have a very expensive led flashlight with hard to replace batteries.  The case was nice however
I've had this camera for a couple of weeks now, it's my 4th digital camera.  I am very happy with the photos I'm able to take, they are truly outstanding.  I'm still learning all of the settings but I'm finding everything to be user-friendly.  I like the way it feels in my hand and I'm pleased with the battery life.  I purchased a 2GB card to replace the one that came with the camera and it's been the perfect size for me.  The video is amazing, I was standing in the upstairs bathroom of our 2 story house and  saw our little one jumping on the trampoline at the far end of our backyard, so I decided to tape it.  Not only was the quality good, the camera picked up the audio, which I never expected!  And I like that you can zoom in or out while you're taping, I wasn't able to do that with my last camera. ---  --- I've had no problems downloading the pics or videos to my computer and the prints I've gotten have been great as well
Two of the worst stories in the history of TOS, but for different reasons. The 'Way to Eden' makes the mistake of trying to be trendy, and so dates badly.  What the real problem is though is that it makes the Enterprise crew seem to be the disapproving establishment, especially of all people Captain Kirk. 'Requiem for Methuselah' is at heart a reasonable story with the assertion that one man could be responsible for the work of Da Vinci, Brahms and others.  What it completely fails to do is have any appreciation for Kirk's relationships with women.  Threre is no way any woman would have Kirk obsessed to the point he would fight for her, he is far to full of his own importance for that. This effectively trashes any credibility that the story would have had because this is the crux of the whole episode. A real pity
I'm not exactly sure how good these are for you??? but I do know they taste great!! I bought these because I never have time for breakfast in the morning, and I'm also sort of a "choco-holic", and these with coffee, or better yet: hot chocolate are excellent! :
I purchased one of these cases for my sister-in-law, and she liked it so much, that I bought one for me too.  I really like it and would recommend it to anyone wanting a great carrying case for their DS Lite. ---  --- The vendor that shipped both of the cases did a great job of a quick shipment of a case that met all expectations.  I would purchase from them again without hesitation
Being a second generation member of this so called "cult" and having parents that went through the same situation as the author, I can say that he must have too weak to fulfill his duty to god and true parents...It's very sad when a member must leave. By sacrifcing you are able to develop a stronger relationship with god. Hope this helps..
This is a nice toy for kids to ride on.  My daughter loves the little horn.  There are some little figurines that go inside the seat which activate the music.  That does not work well at all.  There are also little toy holders for the figuerines but those never get used either.  It's a cute riding toy but a lot of the features don't work well.  Worth the buy if a family is really into the John Deere theme
I have to agree with the other reviews of this scope.  I purchased this scope as a Christmas gift.  When I opened it, the equatorial mount (the basis for the ENTIRE scope) was broken.  I contacted Celestron and was promised another part for it, which never arrived.  I contacted the company again and finally had the replacement part shipped to me.  It DIDN'T FIT.  Finally, I was sent another telescope to replace the original telescope.  The equatorial mount was in 1 piece.. yeah!  Too bad the optical tube had a screw that was bent and I could not assemble this one. I even had the chance to speak with the manager of the technical support (who was the original person who offered to send me the part that never arrived) and all I got was a bunch of excuses. --- I finally took peices from both boxes and made myself one ENTIRE telescope.  It's February and I just now have a product that works.  (I haven't had time to try it though!)  Celestron offered no refunds for this telescope, so buyer beware.  If they are not willing to satisfy customers, your business is better served with a company who will stand behind the product it sells. Good luck
I think that the beginning of the book was the worst part. He started by telling us that he was leaving and wasn't going to tell anyone. He didn't even say goodbye to a lady friend. so he tells us that he's leaving and then he goes back into the past. Back when he was a little kid. He tells about different experiances. how he had to stay in bed for almoxt five years. he tells about all the troubles that his family went through. The end was the best part. i usually hate the endings but this one was good. --- this bool is meant for older people who like English books. or is it Ireland. i think it was set in Irelan
i didnt got the car charger i actually bought they sent a regular one im not even using it. WRONG ITEM
This is not what I expected from such a gifted artist as Jaheim, did he change producers? The music and the man with the voice didn't go together well for me.  This is one I will not be purchasing, it is a serious down grade from his previous two albums. Better luck next time, Jaheim I was truly disappointed.
First of all, I do agree with the above reviewers who thought this wasn't a great fruit dip. Second, there's very little marshmallow flavor-this stuff is NOTHING like regular marshmallow fluff.  ---  --- However, I still give this 5 stars, because it's got features you can't get anywhere else. The texture is smooth pudding (Grainy reviewer perhaps ate his past the expiration date?) and that's mainly how I use this. Because of the slightly sharp taste of the cellulose, this dip lends itself very well to making citrus puddings (just add about 1/4 cup lemon concentrate and stir, doesn't get any easier than that). I also use it to make cheesecake and other dessert recipes.  ---  --- To actually make a good fruit dip out of this, try mixing it with yogurt or cream cheese
Okay but does not keep cool for long. I do like the massage effect from the beads
Brubeck and Desmond work their special magic here and produce their finest live recording.  This is sophisticated improv to tame the beast.  I have listened to these tracks uncountable times and I never get tired of them.   This is truely a wistful soundtrack to transport one to a higher realm.   Try this the next time you are caught in heavy traffic on a rainy  afternoon.  You won't mind the delay.  It never fails
I have used this pasta for two years.  It has an excellent taste and consistency while being low carb.  Much better than whole wheat choices.  I've tried all the selections and all I can say is I'm looking forward to the company adding rigatoni and acini de pepe sometime in the future.  It's hard to find in restaurants but if you are ever in Pittsburgh, they serve it at Gullifty's-wonderful.  Some diabetics may find it doesn't work for them--trial and error if you eat it because of diabetes.
I was impressed with the quality and detail of the ring. The person I bought it for loves it, and as a jeweler herself, that says alot. I was afraid of the metals when I bought it, but she has had no problems. Overall the ring is a gorgeous imitation of history and I would highly recommend it and the company I bought it from
Basically, This backpack is all that I need in a back pack. Very well padded, very roomy, fits an HP Pavillion dv8000 17" laptop. Its very attractive and after a month on use shows no signs of ware and tear. Definately worth the $. Unlike my previous packpacks The straps adjust so quickly and easily that I adjust them every time I put the pack on or take it off. Great Product!!!
I never found the fork part of a spork to be very useful. Now we have this Light My Fire spork, and I have to wonder why nobody thought of this before! Nearly perfect for typical backpacker meals - probably MRE's too. If you've a friend or relative "over there", send 'em one
This Boppy slipcover is super soft and wears well. We've washed it in the washing machine several times, and it's very durable. If you're looking for a soft, simple, durable Boppy slipcover, I'd highly recommend this one
The plot of this book was interesting, and it could have been a good book. Unfortunately, it wasn't. The main problem for me was that the hero is dispicable, and the heroine has absolutely no self esteem! Even many of the the secondary characters are weak, miserable people! ---  --- The story starts when the hero finds himself drawn to the heroine even though he considers her a "dirty little nobody". Once she gets a makeover and is actually beautiful, he begins pressuring her to become his mistress even though she is an innocent marriageable female by regency standards. Because she is the daughter of a "cit", he can't imagine why she has any reservations about the deal. He says charming things to her like "how much do you think your virginity is worth anyway". Now that's romance!  ---  --- Meanwhile, even though she is unbelievably insulted by the hero many times, she finds herself drawn to him too. For me their relationship was sort of like an abuser and his victim. She never stood up for herself, and you felt sorry for her. ---  --- Of course the plot twist involves a mystery about her parentage... only its not really a mystery because almost everyone knows the hero is a Dukes granddaughter, including her. In fact just about the only one who doesn't know is the hero, which provides the dilemma. He would of course be willing to marry her if only he knew she really wasn't a nobody! ---  --- Will anyone tell him? Will he wise up and offer to marry her even though she isn't good enough for him? Will she give in to her desires and become his mistress since he doesn't think she is good enough for him to marry? Of course it all works out, and he actually proposes to before he finds out she actually is good enough for him. Ugh!!! ---  --- This could have been a good book if the "mystery" had been handled better, and the characters were written differently. As is, it is a sad regency tale
I've tried a lot of different "nutrition" and "energy" bars, and these are my favorites (along with a couple of other chocolate ZonePerfect bars like Double Chocolate and Chocolate Raspberry). Great taste, a nice texture (sort of like Nestle Crunch), and much more satisfying than candy bars.  Almost as tasty as Girl Scout "Thin Mints", but not as fat- and guilt-inducing
My diet requires that I eat less sugar so I'm constantly trying sugar free products. I've always loved the Jelly Belly brand and the sugar free beans are a great alternative. My favorite flavor by far is buttered popcorn and it tastes almost exactly the same as the orginal. The only thing is the outer shell is a bit harder than the traditional bean, but for someone who is picky it wasn't enough to bother me. It is lower in calories but watch what you eat because it still has carbohydrates just like anything else. I would recommend this product to anyone
I had high expectations for these socks given my previous experiences with the brand. The socks were too narrow in the foot and too tight around the ankle. They are not comfortable to wear and overall, a big disappointment
I am writing neither to critique the movie nor to eplore the quality of the video or audio. I would simply like to warn potential buyers of the manufacturer defects that I have enconter with TWO copies of this DVD.  ---  --- The first copy was scratched so severly it looked like a fat guy attempted to use it to ski down slopes of rough pavement. So Amazon promptly shipped out another. The second copy didn't have a scratch but the movie hung up in the EXACT same place as the first. ANNOYING! I am currently waiting on another copy, but if it's bad I'm giving up. ---  --- *IMPORTANT* Consumers, take my review very seriously because I suspect these other reviewers have no experience with the DVD, they're just fans of the film. And what an awesome film it is
Up Front: If you're considering this lens, stop considering  - and buy it. I had occasion to try the Tamaron Zoom in this range and noticed plastic-y digital qualities in some of the Tamaron's highlighted-texture areas. None of that is a problem with this Canon beauty. I am using it as my normal lens. The contrast is razor-sharp enough to shave with. It's graphic in monochrome and colors are pure and leap off the monitor like a politician attracted by a TV camera. It's also light weight and plenty fast enough with practically no spherical Abs.... ---  --- Tiny problems include an understandable perspective bulging on subjects about the edges. And there is some blue fringing on very high contrast edges. Photoshop nails the latter dead'er than Britney Spears' career. I've had a need for reasonably large blow-ups, with most captures cropped, yet still enlarged up to prints that are minimally 13X20. At that size not only does this lens reproduce a subject's pores, but you can peer down and see the stuff inside the craters.  --- 
Classic wedding tuxedo. Excellent fabric and cut. The tuxedo was changed to single breasted suit after my approval.
John Waters who likes to be called the "Pope of Trash" has done a lot of films that are outrageous in style such as "Cecil B. Demented," "Pecker," & "Hairspray." "Cry Baby" is a 1990 musical that is utterly silly and frothy, but works nevertheless. Johnny Depp, now a big box office draw and critical success with Oscar nominations for "Finding Neverland" & "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," can be proud of the rockabilly Elvis-type singer he plays named Wade "Cry Baby" Walker. Depp performs his "Jailhouse Rock" type number with great energy and rebellion. Having him run through sewage pipes in his underwear is enough to set many a teenage girl's hearts aflutter. The female lead is Allison played by Amy Locane who worked in other films like "Airhead," "The Mummy" & "Bongwater." She does a good Olivia Newton John-like "Grease" character of the square girl who has a crush on Depp's bad boy. Stephen E. Miller who was recently seen in "RV" with Robin Williams and previously in "The Accused" with Jody Foster does a good job as the square boyfriend Baldwin who loses his girl to Cry Baby.  ---  --- The supporting cast also frolics and froths with Ricki Lake as sister Pepper who is intensely pregnant. Iggy Pop plays the daddy Belevedere and takes a scrub bath in a tub sudsing up favorite parts of his anatomy with gusto. Traci Lords who was an adult film star plays Wanda to the hilt. The deleted scene where she sits in an oversized champagne glass while other hotties romp nearby is way over the top. Kim McGuire plays the character Hatchet Face with a permanent mug. Susan Tyrell who actually was nominated for an Oscar in 1972 for "Fat City" plays the biker matriarch Ramona. She recently appeared with Bob Dylan in the film "Masked & Anonymous." Polly Bergen does a nice job as Mrs. Vernon Williams, Allison's grandmother, who emphasizes propriety but encourages her granddaughter to follow her heart. Patricia Hearst (the same I think) who also worked with Waters on "Pecker" & "Cecil B. Demented" does a nice job as the naive mother who uses the "F" word in the courtroom. "Cry Baby" is meant for pure entertainment; and that it does! Enjoy
This product is exactly as it is described.  Wonderful tasting and delicious.  Too bad it doesn't come in a bigger container
My experience with this brush has been terrible.  Well, the first two or three days were wonderful.  By the third day, the brush was shedding bristles like mad into my razor.  By the second week, the wooden handle (which does look durable) cracked and the plastic sleeve that holds the bristles popped out--never to go back in again.   I am replacing this brush, sadly, after about 15 uses, and I will be purchasing a more expensive brush, I hope with better results. --- ***Update, a few months later:  I didn't replace the brush.  I super-glued the bristle-sleeve back into the wooden handle.  It eventually stopped shedding bristles, and I have used it successfully since then.  The wooden handle still looks like it will deteriorate quickly as the finish continues to chip off.  Still not recommended, since I don't think I should have to repair a product within the first few weeks of use
Finger tips a bit too long... not a problem just turned them down, very comfortable, relieves stress on fingertips and palm... nice design and fit.  Hard to beat for this price
The cooker is very versitile.  We used it in the last week for a fish fry and then a low country boil.  The product works fantastic
The ends are comming off this cable doesn't meet the normal Belkin standards
Very nice size, almost perfect shape, beautiful luster and color. Great to wear with almost anything. They are very chic and classy. I'm very happy I bought them!!
I really did some research on digital cameras, even tried out a Sony, but the Canon brand is by far one of the best.  I don't have to do a lot of thinking when snapping a picture with this camera, it does most of the work!  I like to be able to think about the compostion of my photo and not ISO, aperature, and all that jazz.  The settings make it so easy and the color of the photos turn out so true.  The digital zoom is great and will even alert you if the picture will come out blurry.  There are so many features on this camera, too many to list.  I even found a great deal at Best Buy on a 2 gig memory card, I get  over 1,000 photos with a high resolution!  It takes alkaline batteries, but I bought rechargeable ones and one charge lasts a long time.  I am sooo happy with this camera, I take it with me everywhere, even a couple of days to work. 
I came across the Immortal Yi Soon Shin by accident while flicking through some satellite channels. Up to this time I had never heard of it, but immediately I was intrigued by the martial art fight scenes and directing. As I continued to watch (it had English subtitles fortunately) I became enthralled by the acting, plot and historical theme. With a little detective work, I learned that I had caught one of the early episodes of a series with over 100 episodes. I told my wife how good it was, and after we watched an episode together, she and I both became die-hard fans and tried to never miss one night of watching it. We managed to watch nearly all of the episodes and we both agree that it is the greatest thing we have ever seen on television. Nearly every episode was better than 90% of the Hollywood movies out there. If you like, action, drama, amazing three-dimensional characters with incredible actors, intersting history, and some of the best writing I have seen on television, or anywhere for that matter, check this out
When I tried this program out, I at first had some trouble running it. But Then I went to the website at: www.kutoka.com and click on the support tab and then select EasySpeak Spanish. They give you a link for the version of Flash 8 you need to run. After this everything worked well. ---  --- While some may have been offended by bathing suits. Not me and not my kids. There is absolutly nothing obscene here folks.  ---  --- This program is the best thing going for learning spanish quickly! And it is fun to use with the many games and puzzles that you work out with real life scenerios. Very artistic and fun. You can go to the bank, the hospital, and several different places, learn a new set of words and situations. that you could really use in a foreign country. My hats off to the designers and creators of this program. Well done!! Bravo! Muy Bien. 
I guess the first thing i'll say is that I got Jedi Academy BEFORE I got this game. I was HUGELY dissaponted. I really liked Jedi Academy but this game is not that great. I have cheat codes so I can have all wepons and all amo and I can be undying. There are partes in this game that are INSAINLY tought. There are way to many puzzles - I don't mind puzzles but there are simply way to many. And some on them are insainly hard. I would recomend you to get Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy - way better the puzzles aren't insain and you get to choose what you look like and....well I could go on but i'll leave it there. If you aredy have Jedi Academy and you want another star wars game that is $20 then you sould get Battlefront thats anoter great game. Just don't get this game. ---  ---  --- 
This is the perfect little tv/dvd for a little girl's room! The picture is great and Hello Kitty pops on screen for certain commands (volume, channel change..). My daughter age 4 loves it. I would have given this product 5 stars but there are a couple drawbacks...the remote control is has SO many buttons and they are VERY tiny, very close together. I can barely read what each button does because the labels/print is also VERY tiny. This is annoying when in my daughter's darkened room and I have to turn on a bright light just to find the pause button... the other thing I have to point out that bugs me is that you can't eject/or open the dvd player unless the tv is in dvd mode. In other words when I go to put in a dvd, I can't just push "open". Nothing will happen. You have to find the right button, choose "dvd" from a choice of 3-4 things, and only then will the tray slide open. All in all, these things would not prevent me from buying this tv again...although it would be nice if they did come out w/ a more kid friendly remote with bigger buttons/symbols for a small child to recognize... One great thing I want to point out--there is fast forward scan that you can watch as it fast forwards (something not all dvd players offer) and this is great when you are putting a dvd in for your child and they want to skip all those pre-movie ads....you can FF right to the beginning of the movie!!!    
When I first purchased the Papermate PhD Multi, I thought, "Wow!" What an awesome instrument. Felt great in the hand and I Iove the flow of the ink. Very smooth. Nice pencil and stylus as bonus!" However, because I liked the pen so much and used it every chance I got, within 3 weeks, the ink cartridge was empty. That's when my love of the pen began to falter. --- I opened the pen, according to the package instructions, and removed the ink cartridge. However, it never worked the same again. The twist and click feature failed to hold the pen in the advanced position, so whenever I would bear down to write, it would retract and push up into the pen again.  --- So, I bought another, thinking I must have done something wrong. Carefully, after the ink ran out in 2 weeks this time (guess I did more writing), I changed the cartridge again. Same thing. At a high price tag ($8-9) for a plastic pen, I bought a third and gave it one more try. Same luck.  --- So, while I loved the feel and flow of the pen, it is certainly not worth the price tag for a pen whose mechanisms,  housing and construction will only last a month.  --- Won't buy another one. Three times and you're out.
Bag is ok but you must be careful if your moving around a lot. With extra batteries in the top zip compartment it is really top heavy and tips upside down while on your shoulder if the camera is out of it. The velcro does not  hold it closed well either. My memory card fell out of the bag during one of these episodes , Thank goodness my husband noticed
After doing a fair amount of Internet research about MP3 players and their features I was under the impression that I would go with an iPod.  Having been in the computer industry for almost 15 years I have never been fond of the Mac and have always been a little biased towards PC's.  This added to my reticence to own a Mac product and the growing complaints about service on the iPod being a 'bit' over priced I forged on. ---  --- I started reading through all of the reviews I could find on the Internet and as always, found a wealth of them here on Amazon.  To my dismay all the reviews I could find on product names I knew absolutely trashed the products they were reviewing which scared me immensely.  Thats is, until I got to the iAudio line.  The reviews were almost all positive and the complaints that were present were things I could easily overlook.  I love the control, I am big guy with big hands and I have rarely, if ever, pushed the control and not had the result I was intending. ---  --- I have had my iAudio X5 for over a month and I have nothing bad to say in the least.  I am an avid Linux user and it works flawlessly with Linux, the sound quality is phenomenal, except the ear buds that came with mine have a lot of static in them so get rid of those.  The FM tuner is great (you wont get that on an iPod).  I travel a lot and I pipe my X5 through my car stereo using a cassette tape converter plugged into the stereo out port. ---  --- What else can I say, this is a great product with great features and it looks good too!  I also bought a case from zCover which fits the purpose but I think that as time goes on some better more versatile cases will come to market. ---  --- A Satisfied Custome
It is a very nice looking clock. I received it in the early afternoon.  I placed it on the wall in my home office.  It repeatedly failed to adjust itself over the next three hours.  I removed it and placed it facing outward against the pane of a North facing window.  It adjusted to the correct time within 15 minutes.  I rehung it in the home office and it has been keeping good time every since.  I am very happy with the value that I received for my money. 
I bought this dollhouse for my daughter's 3rd birthday.  Within the first week I had to glue at least 3 pieces of furniture back together.  Over the past year I've repaired numerous pieces and the house cannot be moved without the back and roof coming off.  (It is now taped together). For $150 and with all of it's "awards" I expected much better quality.  I think ALEX needs to stop selling this house and redesign it
Worst product on the market! A huge disappointment. I was very careful to use as directed. The result? One big mess! The lens were smeared and foggy with bubbles in them and I had no choice but to throw them away
I am a novice at web page creating and I am OVERLY glad I tried the free web trial (of course I lied about my address and my first born etc. that you MUST give to just get the so called "FREE" trial) this is the WORST web page editor for not so with it people.  It does not look anything even close to what frontpage had and again I am highly disappointed with it.  Where are the themes, web counters and the other simple to understand components ? I did try Namo Web Editor and for people like me, it is very good.  This may be wonderful for those of you who are very web page saavy but again if you are a novice don't get this or uprgrade to it, you will be HIGHLY disappointed
I came in a timely manner and was exactly what I expected.  The person that received it loved it
I can verify again that this is indeed 16 gauge wire. This size works very well for small-medium satellite speakers. I am using this wire with a Samsung HT-Q80 HTIB. It's working wonderfully and I'm getting nice crisp sound. Unlike the other reviewer, my spool came fully intact. I would suggest this for anybody looking for good, cheaply priced 16 gauge speaker wire
A close friend made the unfortunate mistake of plunking down 2 grand for this camera.  Honestly Olympus produces cameras that can do the same thing for $400.  I've used hers and the image quality is horrible and the colours are wrong 9 times out of 10.  If you're going to spend that much on a camera, get the D70 instead and buy a nice extra lens or some other gadgets to go with.  The pictures are better and it offers more MP
I wouldn't recommend this product to any one. The phone cover really sucks. I just used this product for a month....and the clip cover peeled off....really disappointed with this purchase. ---  --- 
I loved the idea that this car seat was. Then after I bought it I have had problems with it. The handle realse has broken many times. Then the gray handle part  has came apart also. This is has not been safe at all. I went to return it and Target would not return or exchange it for me. I think it was a waste of money
I have introduced many of my ELL, high school students to Lois Lowery and the depth of her characters. She is a brilliant writer and capable of inspiring fierce passion in her readers as they encounter shocking details of her utopian worlds. I was anxious to read this companion novel and had planned to share it with my class this January. Although the series is written for 6th graders and older, this book's simplicity, in its message, language and writing style will inspire no one.  I am sadly disappointed
My husband is an airline pilot, and since they took away his crew meals he needs meal replacements.  There frequently is not enough time between flights to grab a bight to eat in the airports.  This is his favorite flavor and often the hardest to find in the store.  Thanks for offering these by the case
I do upside down situps with a 50 pound vest on and a 25 pound dumbell in each hand. I weigh 185 pounds. No creaks bends or falls, great produc
My boyfriend found this watch at a retail store & put it on his Christmas list.  I purchased it at Amazon at a much better price.  This was a replacement watch for an old Timex watch.  My boyfriend says he loves this watch - no complaints at all.  He says the buttons are easier to push than those on his old watch & he especially likes the large, easy to read display. 
My son is only 2 months old so they are a little large right now.  I'm sure they will be perfect once he grows into them
It seems like a nice complete set of playfood, except that the boxes are really flimsy cardboard, and I've thrown most of them out already.  It doesn't take much to crush them.  There are much nicer sets out there, and there are separate pieces sold on ebay, that are probably used but will stand the test of your kids much better.  Not worth the money
This is the first and only DVDs I will buy from this company.  This could be possibly the worst instructional videos that you could buy.  I learned absolutely nothing, and the women were disgusting.  Trust me do not buy this DVD if your life depends on it. 
There are two story lines here, one an unqualified celebration of the state of girls' prep sports after a generation of Title IX's beneficial impact, and another the very qualified consideration of the state of some individual girls' athletic lives after a generation of Title IX's less beneficial side-effects.  Heartbreak, fury, exultation are the viewer's rewards.  Only quibble is that the climactic game was documented in too abbreviated a manner
Use it every day, it's a nice connector that does just what it says it does.  As with all Treo/Palm connectors, you need to make sure the contacts are clean to get a good connection.  Wiggling the connector where it meets the Treo is usually enough for it to work for me
Using this product requires that you agree to turn over the keys to your computer. If you refuse an upgrade, Amazon can delete all of your previous purchases without giving you a refund. ---  --- This is a quote from Cory Doctorow, who wrote about the Terms of Service for Amazon Unbox (Amazon Unbox to customers: Eat !@#$ and die): ---  --- Amazon says it respects your privacy, but this clause tells the real story.

These are a complete waste of money.  The nipples flow too fast for a newborn.  I tried using them many times during my return to work transition and my daughter choked and cried during each feeding.  She also swallowed so much air-I was burping her for what seemed hours.  The bottles are too expensive for just storage-you can purchase generic breastmilk storage bottles made by evenflow for $3.99...personally I like to use the storage bags laid flat in my freezer, they take up less space
Forget all the silly little earbuds. These are the best pod phones out there for daily urban use. They sit well enough on the ear, sound fantastic and you don't have to violate your ears with foreign objects and miss all of the subway announcements. So what if other people can sometimes sort of hear what you are listening to - this is only a problem if you BLAST your music in a cube farm and if that is going on, you have far bigger problems with your life
HP is selling this bag for $30 bucks, so when I found it here for $10 less I couldn't let this "Deal" pass me by... however when I received the bag, I wished I had... the color is less vibrant, it's cheap, poor quality, plus HP isn't embroidered on the bag... walk away from this bag and get the blue and black HP bag instead, it costs a little bit more but it's well worth it!!
I recently purchased this item and I am very happy with its performance and quality. I use it daily in the gym it delivers excellent sound and you dont even realize you have it on due to its light weight
Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker deliver once again in this follow-up to their great film "Rush Hour". This film follows on the premise of the first, with a bit of a reversal....this time Tucker is the fish out of water in Chan's Hong Kong. ---  --- As with my review of Rush Hour, I'll say up front that if youre looking for anything more than a fun-filled actioner, then this movie wont please you. It breaks no new ground and the plot is quite formulaic, but if you're looking for deep drama and character development...what are you doing watching a Chris Tucker movie? ---  --- Watch for a great cameo by Don Cheadle as a black man married to an asian woman who owns and runs a Chinese Soul Food restaurant in a black section of Los Angeles. That alone is worth a laugh. There is another stand-out cameo by Jeremy Piven as a gay clothing store clerk who mistakes them for a couple. Be sure to watch the end credits and catch all of Piven's ad-libbed outtakes that ended up on the cutting room floor. But then, as with all Jackie Chan films, half the fun is watching the flubs during the end credits
Every time I write on it holes go right through it! Dont by this! If you fold it, it rips in the fold!! Dont Buy this!!! You will be sorry
Usually a metronome is used for musical purposes, but I actually purchased it for karate training.  I do a hundred kicks on each leg per type of kick and I use the beat from the metronome to keep me going at my desired pace.  Also, I can boost the pace and keep track of my improvement.  I know, a bit odd, but it really does the job for what I wanted it for. 
I recently bought my second of these. The first had a digital tuner. You had to get used to the feel. After about a year of use, one earphone went out. The one I just bought has an analogue tuner, and it is extremely hard to get any station other than the very high-powered pop (and around here, country) stations. The tuner requires extremely small movements to move way up the dial. I can't believe Sony is charging $40.00 for this cheap piece of junk
The recipes in this book are often somewhat complex, but they are easy to follow and the results are wonderful. Braising does not aways take a long time either.  One of my favorites is Soy-Braised Chicken Thighs with Star Anise and Orange Peel - 40 minutes total
I originally bought this CD case for my car, because I listen to CDs the most while driving.  This was not a good case to bring back and forth at all.  It is very large and heavy (even without CDs!), and the long zipper-tail makes it hard to open with one hand.  I now use it to house computer software and playstation/gamecube games.  For what you pay, it is an excellent buy
A friend of mine used to meet me for lunch while boasting a beautiful & glowing face from a $50.00 facial she had just received.  This product (even after the 1st use) produced the same results & I never had to leave my home.  My skin always goes through hell during the winter months when its continually exposed to artificial heat.  My skin feels & looks like I've lost about 7 years time.  I'm very, very pleased with Olay.  I've used their Total Effects lotion for years & I did purchase the regenerist serum to apply after using the kit.  This is an excellent exfoliant & hands down, the best skin regenerating product I've ever used
Having enjoyed LOST IN TRANSLATION, I thought I might like this one, which seems to have some sort of cult reputation-- why I can't fathom. The entire plot is self-serving, shallow, and unrealistic. I guess it's supposed to depict the horror of repressive religious values, and while I don't condone those, the film lacks clear characters or any motivation. A lot of people have buttoned up parents who don't get it, and it doesn't mean they kill themselves-- because they were grounded!? ---  --- Since the writer-director gerw up in Hollywood, she may not be aware that you can't keep your kid home from school without a very good reason-- social workers and what not come after you. So the entire premise is false. ---  --- Romanticizing mass suicide by having a bunch of soft focus young blondes do it-- after which they supposedly ascend to erotic eternity in the imaginations of their boyish peers-- could actually encourage the act. It's not caring, not real, and not responsible. ---  --- But I guess that wouldn't bother the rich, overfunded daughter of a Hollywood genius out to make a name for herself.
Two months after ordering the magazine I have yet to receive a single issue
I upgraded to this version from Money 2000.  The interface looks cleaner, and the reports and budgeting options are better.  I do find it a little less intuitive than the older version that I am used to.  Overall, I'm happy with this product and there is room for me to get to know it better.  I think it will last me for several years
Great movie! Pretty funny, and it has a  wonderful moral to it, but I won't give it away! Watch the movie! You'll love it
Works as billed.  I am currently playing a DVD+RL that would not play on any other player.  I have not purchased a 1080P LCD TV, but it is why I purchased an upconverting DVD player.  I have tried DVD+R and DVD+RW.  I will be trying audio formats later.  I would recommend this product to anyone who is waiting for the HD versus BlueRay to determine which will be the dominant technology and for its price to come down
The scanner worked fine, although it reads out a generic code.  When I went to Actron's website and signed up for "lookups" which go into more detail, I found what I was looking for.  It was very detailed and helpful.  However, subsequent attempts to enter the "lookups" at Actron's website proved frustrating, after I had paid for them
This product does not do what it advertises. Does not work at all on my facial hai
I purchase this press, and was totally disappointed with this product. It takes longer to press a shirt with this so called press, than with an iron. I will be returning
Bob Quinn is definitely one of the most profound writers on change in this era. But his work is not for the faint of heart because he challenges each of us to start change initiatives in the place we'd least like to go -- inside ourselves. I found this an incredibly powerful book. I've used sections of it with my "change management" classes for several years and I know it has a tremendous impact on students, who like most managers have grown up unconsciously believing that change always needs to start with the other guy. If you want a simple formula for change, don't buy this book. Although it is full of practical, actionable ideas, "Change the World" addresses change at a profound level that asks readers to reflect seriously on what they stand for. It's a very difficult but rewarding assignment
Our daughter loves the mobile, she laughs every time the peek-a-boo leaves open to reveal the animals. Unfortunately both mobiles that we have bought have failed, none of the music buttons will work except the forest sounds. The sound is also very soft
It is not one of the stain removers , which instantly gets rid of the stain.  --- So when you spill over something over your t-shirt, you got to spill this TIDE STAIN REMOVER on it as well so it does make sure that your cloth wouldnt be clogged with STAIN but its not an immedieate relief solution
Really great!  Beautiful graphics, easy to follow instructions, levels to keep us going.  Very fun and challenging
I've been using this phone with the Net10 service since March, and have to say I am very happy with it.  Coverage areas have been great. --- I don't use a cell phone very often, so this was the most economical way for me to go. Although the phone doesn't have all the bells and whistles like other phones have....it gets the job done
This product is a must have for your Shure earphones.  Once you use this with the earphones you will not want to use the headphones without, it just takes a little getting used to
I use this product all the time.  It was becoming hard to find in department stores, but I found it available and cheaper online.  I'm very happy.
I really like the size of this pitcher but there is one thing that I'm not too happy about.  The filter doesn't "lock" down into the top and when you tip the pitcher over to pour the water out, the filter plops out of the top, causing the whole top to fall out of the pitcher.  It's very aggravating and just about makes it more trouble than it's worth.  The other Brita pitcher I have, the filter locks into place and doesn't do this. --- 
It says that it works with vibration, maybe if you are dancing on a trampoline. The kids are not really that impressed
I bought a new PC last week and maxed it out with a gig of ram and 512 video card...Vista was preinstalled... ---  --- These are the basic specs of the PC I have: ---  --- AThlon 64 X2 dual core processor --- 2 Gig memory DDR 2 --- 250 SATA HDD ---  --- not only did this thing run slow...I found out that a lot of my old software wouldn't work...what gives???? ---  --- I ran Company of Heroes (seemingly a surefire bet considering the upgrades) and that crawles like I was trying to run this on a minimum spec'ed machine...and mind u I bought this new AND did upgrades (an extra 250 dollars worth) so I wound up spending a nice part of Saturday reformatting the HDD and putting XP back on my machine and viola! I really get to see whta kind of power I am working with... ---  --- for those of you thinking about going back to XP, do it and wait until Vista gets figured out...it's 250 dollar resource hog and it won't be on my machine for a little while...and while u are at it...please be sure to back up your drivers files...
We LOVE this monitor, but only when it does not have awful interference.  Unfortunately, in the evening for some reason the interference is really bad and all we hear is static off and on for hours.  We do not live in an apartment or townhouse (which I read was not recommended for this product), but we do have wireless internet. Only we aren't using it when there is static, so who knows... ---  --- I love being able to see my boy, but the static makes the monitor REALLY annoying
My boys are 5 and 7 and they can play this at different levels and enjoy it very much!! They have played it and learned from it extensively
My old Grill was well over-due for replacement, and so I started doing some research into a replacement. My previous grill was a Coleman, and had lasted a good 10 years, although the cooking quality had definately deteriorated. ---  --- I was going to purchase another "cheapy" grill, but in my research, I noticed something - almost every Weber owner rated their grill 5-star, whereas the cheapies usually mustered three stars at best. ---  --- A little more research quickly pointed out why - Webers may not last any longer than the cheaper competitors, but a 10-year old Weber still cooks better than the cheap ones do when brand new. ---  --- I invested in the "Platinum C". but have yet to use the side-burner, so I'm not sure how valuable that is. I was delighted with the quality of the Grill - it was easy to assemble, and the cooking quality is - fantastic. I purchased a Weber Griddle, and I also have a Pizza stone, and with these two additions, I cooked 8 meals in a row on my Weber, including Bacon and Eggs, home-made bread, pizza, and of course, grilled steak
I purchased Elements because frankly,I couldn't afford the whole big Adobe enchilada.I have found it to be pretty intuitive.Lots and lots of options as to organization,photo-tweaking and such. I have had a lot of fun messing around with the program and my digital photos. --- I do have two other imaging programs,and with the addition of Elements,I feel like I'm basically well-set with zillions of options.Plus,there are several web sites dedicated to digital photography,and they supply free downloads of Photoshop samples, such as "textures," and so on.Very helpful. --- Get this if you can't spring for the complete Photoshop program. You will not be disappointed
i only liked it when pinnochio talked. that was funny, but the rest of the movie was discusting. Some of the scens were very sick (not the blood, but other things). There was no blood hardly, and i could have made it alot better. I espected a good film but it was ... and i would never see it again
It's easy to make (recommended measures are available online, and you can go a little more milk or powder if you want) and the package makes ALOT.  I like not having a 45 minute drive to get my favorite drink
I have to admit, I expected a lot more from Mr Setzer. The first track was ok, then it proceeded to go down hill from there. Not much rockabilly happening, then it all comes clear with "Really Rockabilly" when he slags off all his traditional rockabilly fans...world wide. He even gives us Aussies a serv, even though I don't think he has ever set foot here. If Brian wants to turn his back on rockabilly and try swing, jazz, rock or whatever, then go ahead, but why slag your old fans?. It's the last time I buy one of his CDs without listening to it first
all i could hear was the local am radio station -- and even that wasnt clear...  spend some more money and get something better..
I found StriVectin-SD Eye Cream to be a nicely textured cream, but it was too heavy for my skin. This is rather strange, as I have dryish skin around my eyes and like a heavier eye cream. This one clogged up my orbital area so much that I got millia (which I never suffered from before).  ---  --- The cream does not absorb very well, but feels good to touch.  ---  --- In terms of wrinkles, I had 0 effect. I in my late 20's and am strating to notice the first crow's feet. StriVectin-SD did nothing to alleviate them.  ---  --- I have to express an opinion on the price though. If you do like the product and it works for you, price should not be an issue, as the tube lasts forever. I have used it for 6 months easily and am now getting concerned that eye products should be thrown away after such long time. Yet it hasn't run out yet.  ---  --- I give it 2 out ot 5 - for the nice texture. And an impressive  advertising campaign that convinced me to try it!
Considered one of Coltrane's 'searching' periods, this CD has a lot to offer in the way of understanding Trane's restless nature. Never one to stand on laurels, Coltrane does indeed continue to set the bar 'higher' every time out. This one is mostly ballad and blues based, with the exeption of 2 tracks in particular which stand out - on both ends of the Trane spectrum. Track #2, "I Love You" finds him playing furious, cerebral runs on the instrument, and , frankly, not as 'listenable' as one may like; whereas the track with Donald Byrd is as 'in the pocket' as you'll ever hear. All in all, a very realistic look at a genius in motion
I show Mustangs and dirt/lint/dust can really impact a judge.  This little thing works wonders and it's bigger brother keeps your car clean and dust free. ---  --- Initially, it will leave a bit of streaking on dark paint as the waxy substance that grabs dirt can come off a bit, but as you use it--and it gets dirtier--it works better and better.  The streaks easily come off with a quick spritz of detail spray. ---  --- Get this.  Use it.  You'll love it.  And get the large one for your outside. ---  --- Trust me.  It's that good
I'm not a mainstream Beavis & Butthead fan...the fans that jumped on the bandwagon when they became popular.  I was there from the beginning.  Where the hell is FROG BASEBALL and BURGER WORLD.  I want to see BURGER WARS!!!!  There was a time when Beavis didn't even talk he just laughed (heh, heh, heh).  Fire....Fire!!!  I want Season 1,2,3.  Just release them as Seasons....let us be the judge of what is good and what sucks.  I want full episodes with videos included.  EVERY TV SHOW IS LIKE THIS ON DVD.  Why is this one different?!  DEMAND FULL EPISODES AND FULL SEASONS!!! 
These are dainty and somewhat small but lovely to wear to work.  Diamonds are a nice, clear quality. 
I had no idea that the Bjorn was so expensive, since I got it as a gift at my Baby Shower.  But knowing what I know now, Id definately spend the cash since its been such a blessing to have it. ---  --- My baby had reflux really bad when she was born and alot of the times, the only way to help her feel comfortable was to have her in the Bjorn facing me so that she could fall asleep.  (She needed to be upright or inclined to help her not to spit up so much)  Being that it was so used, Im super glad that its easy to put on and take off.  The durability of it is awesome also and I still dont see any wear and tear on it after almost daily use.  ---  --- Now that my baby is getting older, I switch her forward and she loves that.  She can see everything and grab at whatever is in front of her.  The ease of the clips is a godsend, so that I can clip her in quickly and without the need for someone to assist me. ---  --- I tried some other carriers, but all the straps and clips were so confusing.  Plus alot of the others arent reversible.  You can only have your baby face inwards.   ---  --- This is totally worth the money guys!   
Great movie.  Hard to believe what C. Bale did to his body to make this film so realistic.  Great photographic work
   The suit itself is great, but the sizing is just way off.  I purchased  ---    a large and an extra large for my kids; the large is actually too big ---    for me, and the extra large is enormous.  It is almost as though they  ---    are sized for men instead of youth.  Hopefully they'll grow into ---    them . . .
For a recently college graduate and moderate sports world observer with little experience negotiating in a business environment, this book was a pleasure to read. The concepts in this book are on or above par with my textbook on negotiation. However, I specifically enjoyed how Steinberg illustrates important concepts with stories involving the ever interesting personalities of professional sports. From establishing values to finalizing the contract, this book is efficiently organized to lead through the negotiation process. Also, at the end of each sub-chapter is a summary of the key points of the reading. Winning with integrity isn't easy in general, let alone in the ruthless world of sports agents. Leigh shares his experiences that have lead to his success in this fun and insightful book
I cannot go shopping without my floppy seat!  I don't know what I am going to do when my infant outgrows either the front pack or car seat as my toddler rides with the floppy.  I reccommend this to everyone who comments on it, to purchase for themselves or as a gift.  I have seen another seat with a large pillow in front for kids to sleep on, or as one mom with a little girl who has siezures could use as protection, but I can't remember where (babycenter.com, $60?). As other reviewers mentioned, I also used mine for the restaurants too, when my toddler was too small to fit comfortably in the seats (not to mention the gunk in the chairs!).  Buy this product - you won't be dissapointed
I love Philosophy products and own much of the skin care line.  I consider Purity facial cleanser a must have.  I was excited to try the hair care line and was so disappointed after using it.  I thought maybe I should give it a good shot and use it a few times to see if it got better with repeated use.  It doesn't.  It is among the worst shampoos I have ever tried.  It's almost worse than the cheapy store bought brands that you use in dire straits.  It instantly left my hair hard and brittle feeling and I couldn't wait to slather the conditioner on.  Even after condiditioning, my hair was lifeless and tangled easily!    The poor quality of this product actually made me doubt the entire Philsophy line
There are many gorgeous photos of both the insides and outsides of public and personal spaces. I was actually surprised at the number of homes we get a peek into. If you enjoy interior design, of just about any style, you will find it here. I love all the personal libraries shown, crammed with books and interesting objects. Loved the mannequins, esp the life-sized guy sitting on the couch. I am a fan of exotic, eclectic decorating and found many examples to keep me happy with the book
This book is so great and touching. As a mixed race teen this book gave me hope and confidence. It taught me to honest and open. It made me proud to be me. Never has a book made me so convinced that I am great and wonderful  to be multiracial. I thank the author for this awesome book. Anyone who is  biracial should read this book. Not just once, but over and over, marking  the poems and stories that you can most relate to and read them when you  are feeling down on yourself. This is one "must have" book
i have been waiting to see this film for a while now. and i just finally saw it i'm very dissapointed. this was nothing but a low budget horror flick with cheap trills. the film sucks!!! the nazi zombies coming back from there watery graves to terrorize modern day tourist that are in a small boat. and get stranded on a deserted isolated island. was a great! idea except that with this film you're going to be very bored and dissapointed if you ask me. i was expecting a lot more than this the zombie nazi's make up looks silly. they're not even frightning or scary they just made me laugh. the picture quality has aged even if it's dvd format very grainy poor picture quality. i have seen other movies from the 1970's on dvd and the picture quality looks excellent almost like new or like it has been digitally remasterd for it's age. but this was awful. the only good thing it has was decent acting lol. like i said before this is nothing but a (low budget cheap horror film) rent it if you like. but dont purchased it it will be a waste of your money and time.  
I've seen this item for no less than $7.00 elsewhere, so I got a good deal.
I purchased the Murad Acne Complex for $40 or so (for a measley one month supply).  I was disgustingly excited to try it, as everything else has failed me.  Proactiv works wonderfully for me, but only for the first month or two, then it seems I grow an immunity to it. ---  --- I paid to have the Murad Acne Complex expedited to me because I was so anxious to get on to 'beautiful, clear skin.'  I read the pamphlet, and understood that my skin could go through a "purging" phase, where your skin literally purges all of the bacteria and other acne causing assailants.  Imagine the worst skin you've ever seen.  Imagine the most painful breakouts.  That was my personal "purging" process.  It was literally the worst breakout of my entire life.  My husband kept telling me to continue using the products though, because this was expected.  I'm STILL using the products, and though my skin is better than it was 3 weeks ago, I'm basically back where I was when I started.   ---  --- I give up.  But I'm not giving up any more money to Murad
I set up everthing according to the Quick install. All setting is correct but i still could not print. I call Technical support,on hold for 20 minuts then told me he was not the right support agent. Back in the loop i go . wait for 30 more minutes 2nd agent told me the same thing. Don't waste your time calling thier support. if it work out of the box great if not return it don't waste ur life like i did
I have owned the Caruso Molecular steam hairsetter for at least the last 15 years and would not buy any other hairsetting product. It is gentle on the hair and gives a wonderful, soft, steamed curl, as opposed to harsh, electric hot curlers. I recently purchased the new "smaller version", because my old one - with the larger water/heating unit, burned out after many years of use. The old one required more water and a bit of salt. It gave great steam, filling the rollers with a lot of steam, thus giving a better curl to the hair. This newer version does not require salt, uses very little water, and does not have the steam making power the older version did. I am very dissappointed in this "newly designed" product. I have packed it away, and will use it only as a back up. I hate it when you use a product for many years and find they have upgraded, improved, or discontinued the product. Sometimes, it is best to leave well enough alone. I will purchasing one of the older hairsetters on Ebay
These shoes are hideous! Who would wear them? They are so uncomfortable. They always give me blisters! I hate these shoes. Do not buy them unless you like getting blisters
I looked at several therapy websites to find the perfect sized ball from my 2 1/2 year-old autistic son to use to bounce on - everything was too big and too expensive.  This ball is just the right size and price and it was delivered quickly
I LOVE this pump! ---  --- If you're going to breastfeed, you NEED this pump.  It's expensive, but worth the investment.  I pump at least 10 times a week and it's just so much easier than the manual pump I tried. --- 
I gave one to my nephew for Christmas and he and everyone else has liked it so well that everybody in the family tried it out and I now have to order one for his mother and also one for my husband.  ---  --- The projection feature is great and the projection display is actually larger and brighter than I thought it would be.  ---  --- To be honest I have to mention the drawback - the display on the clock itself is so small and not backlit so you have to be pretty close to it to see the time during the day.  --- Until someone puts a projection feature on a larger size CD/alarm clock, we will continue to keep our old alarm clock and put this one on the other side of the bed and use it mainly for the projection feature. ---  --- Even with the drawback mentioned, we all love the clock. My nephew loves being able to see what time it is without putting on his glasses
There is one thing that every cookbook author can learn from How To Cook Without A Book: Recipes and Techniques Every Cook Should Know By Heart, by Pam Anderson (not the big-breasted one), and that is the art of the highly marketable title. ---  --- For starters, this artful moniker really plays on the single gal's fears about never being able to put together nutritious, attractive, varied, affordable, and delicious meals for her future family every single night of the week. You want your kids to be armed with more than some simple carbohydrates when you send them off into the big bad world. ---  --- So the plus side of this book is the title. That's where it ends. The big idea here is to help the reader become a non-cookbook-consulting cook by: a) teaching basic cooking techniques that are conducive to variation, and b) suggesting mnemonic devices for said cooking techniques. Sounds interesting so far, right? ---  --- Well, the problem is that almost all the recipes rely on "canned low-sodium chicken broth", which I think is a bit of a weird ingredient. It's even included in the salad dressings. Other big hitters include: heavy cream, butter, and sour cream. Do people really eat like this? Regularly? ---  --- Why not make the Easy Fruit Parfaits for a quick and sweet ending to your meal? Just take a tall glass, drop in a few spoonfuls of sour cream, then a few spoonfuls of brown sugar, and some berries. Repeat until the glass is filled. ---  --- Crikey. Sour cream, brown sugar, and berries?!? Wouldn't it be just as easy to put the berries in yoghurt sweetened with a little squirt of Greek honey? Am I totally off base thinking that this sounds much more appetizing? Or, if calories are no object anyway, why not pick up some Baskin Robbins' Rocky Road on the way home from work? That's easy AND it's worth the internal havoc it will cause. ---  --- Oh, and here's a sample mnemonic device that I can't not share, it's that good: ---  --- "Cook tender vegetables with garlic and oil, --- Then toss in some pasta that's fresh from the boil." ---  --- Pure genius, right? Right.  ---  --- In a way, the author was right - I CAN cook all these things without a book. But why would I want to
It is a nice watch for the Dollar spent on this item. The catch is that it will work with the concept of Wave-ceptor. And it adjusts time according to the place you are in. So...good watch..!
The only reason why I stayed and watched the movie the whole way through was because I paid to see it. Awful movie. Not entertaining at all. It was just so poor. The animation wasn't fantastic. Political messages shouldn't be in children movies. Not a good movie.
I have trouble to buy from Bestbuy, but I ordered it from amazon, cheapest price and good product! Thanks
A "Jewelry Box" for your little girls polly pocket accessories. My daughter received this as a gift for Christmas and loved it!  Would be perfect if it was just a little bigger but is definitely worth the money
This is by far the most enjoyable hot chocolate I've ever come across for consumer purchase.  It is high in calories and expensive, but if you are looking for a rich, comforting cup of chocolate, this is it.  This hot chocolate is thick and delicious in the European sense, yet not overly sweet as many American brands are.  Unfortunately, MarieBelle is neither organic nor fair trade, but if that is not important to you then there is no downside.   ---  --- I've found no other maker produces a finer cup of chocolate, save the City Bakery in NYC--which is the next best thing to Parisian hot chocolate
I orignally bought this to hold all of my babies bath things. It got too heavy & everything wouldn't fit. So now I use it to hold his baby tylenol, etc. It is really nice.
This is such a Great book I have boughten copeys for all my childern
This item is packaged very poorly. You have to literally rip the box apart to open it. I did this TWICE, and both times the very last item was completely cracked in half. Very inconveniently shipped and packaged.
I saw the scene,where they have Lissa chained to the pool table and gagged in the basement.I didn't understand most of the movie. I bet Kim Possible,Ron Stoppabl,and Rufus can deal with them
Bought this housing new in November 2005.In April I used it for the first time and it flooded on the first dive! Neither Amazon (since it is ouside the 30 day return policy) nor Canon will stand behind this product! Period! I got so much run around from Canon it was ridiculous. They wanted to "evaluate" the housing to determine if it was defective...DAH? They WOULD NOT tell me if I sent it back for the "evaluation" what the final resolution would be (refund, rework etc).  ---  Coincidentally, another person on the same trip had the same housing...it flooded on their first dive too!!!! --- Coincidence? No. Just terrible quality control and NO product support from Canon. DO NOT BUY CANON PRODUCTS!!
If you have trouble sleeping...THIS mask is for you!!  For anyone struggling to get even a few minutes worth of sleep...  You will not be disappointed!!  Fabulous!  Whether for a nap or for getting through the night - this mask will definitely help!  I have given several as gifts and everyone is in agreement with me!  The only negative is - the company changed from an endless sound model to 30 minutes of sound...therefore - I wake up and have to re-hit the sound selection...but, I'm still getting more sleep than I have in years and years!
This is a quality heavy duty grill cover.  When you pay good money for a Weber Grill you want it to stay looking good.  Don't go buy one of those cheap Walmart covers for $10.  It will not last and you will end up buying another one in a year or two.  This cover wasnt cheap, but by the looks of it...it should last a long time
They say it's quiet, and it holds tons of data.  They were correct.  Fast access speed, easy installation, an overall fine product.  Have not used the feature that let's you back-up your entire drive, but we use it in our LAN for shared files, and it's comforting to know that we've got these files stored redundantly.  This box does just what it claims to do, the warranty of merchantability (from my old law class!).
Made a little girl very happy. Order processed, shipped and delivered in a timely manner. Just as expected
This software is fine for altering digital pictures if you do not have any other programs, but if you want to make exciting slideshows, this software is very basic and not user-friendly.  I had technical problems from the start.  You are better off using MS Powerpoint than this software
I bought this watch for my son, a Marine, serving in Iraq, because he requested a sturdy digital with an alarm. This one had a large face which he says is extremely easy to read in any light, especially at night. --- It is comfortable, and sits close to the wrist with very little profile. --- He loves it, and asked me to order a second one because he wants a back-up!
it lauches the marble so forcefully that the marble bounces off of the ramp it is being lauched to.  Instead of using it for the fridgits set, my youngest son used it to launch M&M's (but that's another story)..
I love this pen.  Not only is it a gel writer with a firm tip but for those who misplace caps or loose them it is perfect.  For those who also like to stick pens in their pockets this will help with the ink stains as it retracts when it is put in the pocket.  I do wish they came in green. ---  --- Barrel is thick enough and has a rubber grip at the bottom so those who has had Carpul Tunnel etc eill be able to grip the pen without pain. ---  --- Thanks Pente
The shoes are awesome...my daughter LOVES them! Business was done in a professional manner and was an easy transaction
Well, I just wanted to say that I am purchasing this to learn more about what could be, my ancestor!  Yup!  My name is Jackie Kidd.  I have been forever interested in anything that has to do with Captain Kidd.  Get this, we all have nicknames at my job and I am called:  Captain Kidd.  People think I'm wacked, but I don't care. ---  --- I think he was a good pirate, he just got caught.  I have been trying to trace my family tree to him.  Nothing is for sure just yet. But I wear my uniform well!  I have a pirate costume that I wear every Halloween.  I stand firm in my heritage, if this is who I am
War has erupted between humans and an alien life force known as the Gnosis.  Man is in danger if nothing is done soon.  That's where Shion Uzuki, the designer for the Anti-Gnosis Weapons System known as KOS-MOS, comes in. ---  --- This game has a splendid opening, it really gets you thinking about life itself (the subtitle is also a book written by a philospher).  Anyway, you start out on a space ship that is creating the ultimate weapon against the Gnosis.  However, before completion the Gnosis attack your ship and KOS-MOS starts herself up by herself. ---  --- From then on, your basically thrown around to different areas, exploring multiple storylines and trying to figure out why everything is happening. ---  --- The graphics in this game are similar to that of an anime game.  The characters have big googly eyes and look a little cartoonish (especially Shion).  That's what really sets the mood for the game, though. ---  --- The battle system is really unique and unlike any I have tried.  Basically you have physical or ether (like magic) attacks.  If you choose to guard during a turn the AP gauge will go up, allowing you to do an extra, more powerful combo.  Once you level up a lot, you'll gain more of these powerful end moves that will allow you to defeat stronger enemies.  You're not limited to just the characters, you also have AGWS units, which are basically mechs. ---  --- I really was not disappointed in this game, I loved it better than any RPG (yes, even FFVII). ---  --- This a great game for the PS2 collection, I would highly recommend it
This is an extraordinary biography for, while Blumenson's admiration for George Patton is evident, it brilliantly illustrates all the sides of Patton's personality - both positive and negative. The book truly goes  beyond the popular perception of the General -and far beyond the movie- in  exploring his character and motivations. Not an overly long book, but  thorough, detailed, and very enjoyable to read
This was not the scariest film I've ever seen, and I really can't take horror very well. But it was good, because there was beauty in it, and that is quite rare in horror films. I think the idea of the film was very good, and surprise in the end too, even though the plot was not so brilliant. ---  I actually liked it. I'll probablu rent it again and watch it this time with sound. ---  --- 
Hey Bret is one of the most tallented song writers of our time!  He will be in the rock n' roll hall of fame when he is done and his guitar playin' and singin' is very underrated!  Buy this
This is one of the best (if not THE best) pure screwball comedies of the 1930's. Next to the original Thin Man movie, Libeled Lady is my favorite Powell/Loy effort. This time, the magic chemistry of that oft-paired duo is enhanced by the box office-drawing talents of fellow mega-stars Spencer Tracy and Jean Harlow. The first shot of the movie celebrates this happy collaboration as the four top-drawer actors merrily, confidently stride arm-in-arm toward the camera.  ---  --- The plot is convoluted. The Star has erroneously printed a story about heiress Connie Allenbury (Myrna Loy), portraying her as a marriage wrecker. Connie immediately files a 5 million dollar libel suit. Star newspaper editor Warren Haggerty (Spencer Tracy) counteracts by hiring on suave fellow newspaperman Bill Chandler (William Powell) to romance Connie and place her in a compromising position, thus negating the lawsuit. Haggerty convinces his harried, long-suffering fiancee Gladys Benton (Jean Harlow) to instead marry the bachelor Chandler as part of the scheme.  Things get really tricky when Gladys falls for Chandler and Chandler falls for Connie, who eventually falls for Chandler. And Haggerty? He pretty much spends the movie just seething. Yet everything ends fairly well, even if there's still lingering confusion as to who is exactly married to whom.  ---  --- Libeled Lady boasts mix-ups and complications galore and couples matching, cross-matching and mismatching. Sophisticated wit blends with full blown physical comedy. Delicious acting is laid in by four stars who, throughout their film careers, never ever lost their prime. Powell proves again his mastery of the confused double-take and, along with the wry, understated Myrna Loy, dominates the refined repartees. And representing the more lowbrow couple, Tracy supplies the blue collar bluster and Harlow the affronted looks. Walter Connolly as Connie's angling-loving father is simply wonderful. The intricate storyline is easy to follow, thanks to the clear helmsmanship of Jack Conway. With this cinematic venture, Hollywood certainly offered up to the viewing audience its most glamorous and most urbane of stars. I think it's brilliant stuff
This is a great product.  My neighbor got one and I've been trying to find them in the stores to no avail.  All it is is a sturdy plastic platform, mounted pependicularly to the pole.  You use it to push snow off your car as opposed to brushing it off.  It's much easier to use than a brush because you push rather than sweep.  I'm buyingit
I had read about evacuators on a few forums - it works as described.  No complaints other than the amount of time it took do draw 8 quarts. --- that said, perhaps the first use included a bit of a learning curve.   ---  --- The fill/drain capability looked appealing, but if you don't need to use this device to fill fluids, I would opt for the drain-only device - less moving parts, fewer things can fail
I don't know about the people who gave 1 or 2 star reviews but this product is the ONLY thing that saved my hair. I did everything from getting a curly perm to stripping the color. I used coconut oil, frequent trims, keratin treatments and NOTHING worked. My hair still kept breaking and splitting like clockwork. When I used the product, 3 treatments later and it's never been healthier. The product is very oily, so USE SPARINGLY when you use it as a gloss or leave in conditioner! ---  --- P.S. People with healthy, not-so-damaged, and normal hair do not need to use this stuff. Because if you do, you'll get silly comments from a tree-hugger that has nothing to do with the product. This product is only for heavy duty damage! By the way, the ONLY thing good from John Frieda is Frizz-Ease...
This is the same toy I was given as a shower gift except mine has a rubber duck in the middle. The women who gave it to me said she got it a a dollar store. Awesome toy for infants since it's light, easy to grip, and easy to bit. My son loved this toy for 2-3 months until he was old enough to move on to bigger heavier toys
NFS Most Wanted is ok, but there are a few things I don't like about it. The variety of cars is mediocre, and the controls are horrible. How can you eliminate the old fashioned way of control by using the pad? I absolutely hated that. The amount of vehicles is horrible...only 37. In NFS Hot Pursuit 2, there were close to 50. I am not thrilled with the tuning feature, and what's the deal with the NOS? The way I see it, if you need NOS on your car, then your car isn't fast enough. ---  --- I like the police AI, that's just incredible, and the 3d models of the vehicles are incredible. The gameplay is great and the combining of the elements from Hot Pursuit 2, Underground, and Underground 2 helps the game, but the variety of the cars hinders it
I really like this mascara. I only gave it 4 because it is clumpy and I have to spend a little time with my eyelash comb getting the clumps out.  Otherwise, it is the only mascara that doesn't cause me to loose a ton of lashes.  Everything else from Estee Lauder, Bourjois to Great Lash causes me loose a lot of lashes.  I also like that if I cry, I don't wind up looking like a raccoon, it subtly melts away; no mess! It washes off easily with soap and water and is flexible, not flaky.
I have known Canon to be a very high quality company. However, I was deeply shocked and disappointed to find that this camera fails to meet the expectations I had about this camera. A few years ago I bought the Fujiffilm 3800. I loved this camera but after a few ski trips I found it rather bulky. I then bought the Canon S500 becaus of its small size and after many good reviews about the S400. For most of the pictures I take on a ski trip this camera is fine. However, if you are taking pictures other than outdoors in the daytime, this camera is worse than a disposable camera. First, there is no red-eye reduction. It simply does not work when I set it to take flash with red-eye reduction. Second, pictures taken at dusk or dawn come out blurry. I would speculate that the shutter speed is way too slow and you would need a tripod. Third, night picture?....Forget about it. I tried to get a beatiful picture of the Chicago skyline but the picture was underexposed. So, I tried the manual mode and played with the exposure settings and I could not get a setting that would produce non-blurry pictures. Looks like I'll be back in the market for a Fujifilm. After all the reviews I've read, I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop (E18, LCD, etc.). Not to mention the terrible service that I have been reading about
when i ordered i didnt read the word double...so when i got it n put it on it was pretty thick and i was like whooa..but its good stuff just heavy for me so im ordering a regular one now
I have had the unit for about 3yrs. rain guage was repaired once. Didn't work one more year. Just had a storm with 50 mile an hour winds. I watched the wind guage, it showed 18 miles an hour. Need I say more!
I bought this just to try something new.  I love peach and mango flavors, and this sounded very good.  I do think it's a good drink, but whether or not I am able to think better because of it is up for debate.  I doubt I'll buy these again if only because they are quite pricey.  12 small cans (the liquid volume is only a smidgeon over one cup) for over twenty dollars?  It's close enough to $2 a can to make it not cost effective to get vitamins and minerals this way.  The taste is good, but I have had lots of other healthy drinks that taste just as good for less than a third of the cost.  But now I know, this drink is not for me.  If you like good-tasting nutritious drinks that cost a LOT of money, this one's for you! 
Those who liked Suede may be looking for more of the same from The Tears, but despite the obviously recognisable vocals from Brett, and the familiar wailing of Bernard's guitar, this marks a watershed in their repertoire. The most obvious difference is that all the songs seem to have been crafted as 'hits' (much more radio-friendly, and why not?). It's also a more mellow sound than Suede (there were fewer opportunities for vigorous bouncing and hand-clapping at the Tears concert I attended). Another important difference is the guitar work, with Bernard soaring off into sonic highs not experienced since Reeves Gabrels and Tin Machine. Among the better songs are Apollo 13, Brave New Century, Refugees and Co-Star. Though Brett and Bernard are capable of better, this is a shot in the arm for us disenfranchised Suede-heads, and I recommend you turn it up loud
These body suits are awful! When I first saw them I was really relieved that I had found something that would be good for the summer months. I put them on my twins after a first wash and the velcro closure scraped up the insides of their delicate little legs! The suits were the appropriate size and were washed according to the label. I am so disappointed and angry. It was a waste of my money.  --- 
I bought this for my husband for Valentine's Day, so he could have photos of our new baby boy handy.  Unfortunately, the images appeared for one day, and then the unit stopped working.  We had to send the unit back.  I was very disappointed as there were many good ratings on the item. 
Yes, she has a great voice, but this entire CD is so overproduced, so lifeless, so very boring that I had to force myself to listen to the entire thing - searching desperately for a track that measures up to the voice. She sounds as bored as I was on every song. I hope she wakes up soon before we all fall asleep
Yep everything is very cool...clarity...etc..but they should do something about clipping in the head of laptop..it is just dancing while I keep it on laptop.
I have used Turbo Tax for about 20 years and have loved it.  In the past it was user-friendly, efficient and complete - it even printed out all the forms I needed - ready to send to the IRS. ---  --- As usual, I purchased it this year.   --- The format changed and isn't nearly as user friendly as in years past.  You have to manually select the walk-through feature, section by section and it's very easy to miss sections. ---  --- When I got to the end, it wouldn't let me do a review for errors until I updated the version.  But, I don't have internet at home and couldn't update.  It crashed my computer 3 times before I skipped the review totally.  (God only knows what else I skipped in the process.) ---  --- When I went to print the forms - again it nagged me that the software was inferior and needed to be updated.  Again, I skipped it but the pages printed out with a nasty watermark saying the forms weren't updated and couldn't be used.  I can't use these.  I can't send them to the IRS.  So, I have to find IRS forms and manually insert the information myself.  So, why did I spend money for the software?? ---  --- Why would they sell a product that you can't actually use?  Yes, it'll "prepare" my forms.  But, what good is that if I can't print them out?   ---  --- Why would they sell a product that was already so obsolete that you can't use it without contacting the company for another version? ---  --- ABSOLUTELY - RUN - DON'T WALK - RUN RUN RUN AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT.  DON'T BUY IT because it simply doesn't work. ---  --- I won't use Turbo Tax again.  They have lost a faithful and long time customer
The French title of this film is IN EXTREMIS (though translated as TO THE EXTREME) and means 'in desperate circumstances, especially at the point of death'.  Rethinking the story of this interesting but problematic movie in those terms after viewing  gives the cinematic effort more poignancy.  This is a tale of the impact of family, loss of parents, dissolution of the core unit has on us all: in this story we are asked to exam the 'in extremis' state of such trauma. ---  --- Thomas (Sbastien Roch) is a hedonist, a handsome young man whose parents died in an Alpine accident, and a man who sleeps with both sexes in a confused state of true identity.  He lives with one of his female lovers who has a young teenage son Grgoire (Jrmy Sanguinetti) whom he loves as a son.  When the mother accidentally dies, Grgoire wants Thomas to be his guardian.  Thomas' lifestyle does not lend itself to fatherhood and though he deeply loves Grgoire, by law and by proclivity he cannot assume the role of foster parent.  Even with the aid of his prostitute sister Anne (Julie Depardieu) he is unable to keep the disappointed Grgoire from being sent to a prison-like orphanage.  Thomas finds solace from his lover Vincent (Aurlien Wiik) and from his excursions into the bohemian all night orgies where he attempts to forget his promise to be available at all times for Grgoire.  Eventually Thomas' devotion to Grgoire overcomes his hedonistic addiction and results in his aiding the boy's escape from the orphanage to move with him to the home in Ibiza his deceased parents owned.  The story has a bizarre but touching ending, which comes totally unexpectedly, and revealing it would ruin the impact and message of the film. ---  --- Director/writer Etienne Faure ('Prisonnier', and ' la recherche de Tadzio' which is included on this CD and traces the life of the actor Bjrn Andresen who played Tadzio in the film 'Death in Venice') directs his actors well but is less successful in finding the interaction of flashbacks, fantasies, graphic indulgences and superimposed poetry inundated with noisy music.  But given these distractions the film still makes a simple case for the significance of family - genetic and extended - and therein is the power of the story.  This is obviously the work of a young director with copious ideas about film and as such one can forgive many of the early experimental indulgences because the heart is in the right place.  In French with English subtitles.  Grady Harp, May 05  --- 
I purchased these for my Mother as a Christmas present.  They are so soft to the touch and I was able to get them in a 7.5 wide which is unusual.  The color is nice too
The New Balance 991 GL (and 991 and 990 before it) is an outstanding shoe for running and day to day use (even some cross training). I have worn this family of shoes because they provide ample support, wear well and are well ventilated. The 991 GL carries on that tradition. Hopefully, the 992 will be just as good
A lonely traveler is out in the dessert (looks like the same place that many great sci-fi movies were made) in his 50's pickup when he spots a strange light. Meanwhile back at the laboratory an unusual meteor is being tracked on its way to earth. What do they have in common? ---  --- The Dr. Leslie Gaskell (Jeff Morrow) suspects that there is some nefarious plot from outer space. They could be right.  But can he prove it? ---  --- This movie is missing the front-end dialog familiar with the classics of the era. They just used the word Kronos because they must have thought it sounded nifty like the giant, this of course is misleading as it makes you think it has something to do with time. There is a love interest between Gaskell (Jeff Morrow) and Vera Hunter (Barbara Lawrence). A fun side interest was looking at al the fancy scientific equipment circa 50's concept. The menacing device is hockey may have had too small of a budget. --- 
With so much talent on show here you would expect a lot better movie, but this is another case of the scriptwriters letting the movie down. Matthew McConaughey delivers another good performance, yet doesn't stray too far from what he knows best. There is Bradley Cooper as his best friend who you will remember as Rachel McAdams fiance in wedding crashers. Patton Oswalt appears in a blink and you'll miss him scene, but the heros of the day are Kathy Bates and Zooey Deschanel who's roles are a lot more important than the characters they play. Bates is great as McConaughey's mother while Zooey is at her sarcastic best as Parker's flatmate. Parker should stick to television, she is dreadful and totally unconvincing in her role, maybe if they had cast someone else in her place there may have been a chance for this movie. A good date movie flick, the story is predictable but I would have been willing to look past that had I been entertained. --- Special features are nothing too special. A trailer and a few dodgy featurette's. A rainy night rental movie
This is the first series of Upstairs, Downstairs.  Chronicling the lives of masters and servants in a Belgravia townhouse, Updown, as it is affectionately known, covers about twentyfive years.  The first series lasts from about 1903 to 1908.  It introduces most of the main characters of the entire chronicle, barring a few later additions to the caste.  Most of this first series concerns the career of Sarah, who has the impertinence to come to the front door when she applies for the position of parlormaid in the first episode.  We also see the early stages of the career of Elizabeth Bellamy, daughter of the house, as she rebels against the path her life is expected to take by her parents.  Some of the episodes in this first series were filmed in black and white, due to a cameramen's strike.  I find these particularly effective in portraying the barrenness of life below stairs.  Some of the episodes are a bit off target, especially The Swedish Tiger, which is just plain weird, but remember the series had not yet reached classic status when these episodes were filmed.  The first series is a great way to start your acquaintance with the residents of 165 Eaton Place
Albert Pyun is my absolute least favorite director. I hate his guts. His direction ruined "Cyborg" and was murky in "Omega Doom." This is his best flick, and it's not that good. In fact, it pales in comparison to the so-so original. Sasha Mitchell is highly entertaining in this sequel that is certainly watchable, but highly forgettable. The villain from the first, Tong Po, has returned after killing the Sloan brothers from the first movie. Now, he's out to redeem his honor by fighting little brother David Sloan. Standard martial arts fare. Some choppy fight scenes, but an interesting main character saves this picture from otherwise becoming complete dreck
Musician's Friend ships orders very quickly and I got this bag together with my new dreadnought guitar within 3 days.  This bag is really well priced ($15) so it's a great deal.  It is built with very sturdy nylon which protects the guitar well.  The nylon is not very thick (about a third-inch), but it gets the job done.  It also has nice shoulder straps to allow carrying the guitar over your back.  The only weakness is that it does not have many/good pocket compartments.  It has a large pocket but the pocket cover is not tightly closed - it's closed with a strap, so things could fall out if you somehow get the bag upside down.  It also has a smaller pocket on top of the larger pocket - this pocket has a zipper and things will not fall out.  Overall a great bag for the price
My recent order of Avery Half-Fold greeting cards was a good price and good quality
nice shoes, cut a bit high in the back so I got blisters at first- love the fabric and color-prompt shipping and nice bo
I love this product and the lasting results. It is so gentle on my hair. I bought two, one being a Christmas present for my neighbor who had recently had a very bad perm, and she agreed, makes the set last while not futher damaging your hair.  --- If you are sleeping in curlers, sleep no more. This product is for you
We bought this product based on its testimonials and thought it would be the best choice for our new baby. While he had no problems using the Playtex Nursers, he ended up having a problem with Dr. brown's Natural Flow bottles. First off, they are a pain to clean. Each piece needs to be painstakenly washed (boiling the nipple, washing the bottle, and scrubbing each hole of the the insert and the reservoir.) It was certainly laborsome and time consuming. Anyhow, when he uses them, he spits up where he didn't with the competition. I tried to figure out why. If you tip the bottle over it drips constantly without any sucking. So my baby is not sucking or swallowing when he uses this product. He lets it build up in his mouth and then ends up having to push it out when he has gotten too much. Needless to say, we are planning to return these and will stick with Playtex
I usually do not endorse a product as "a must have" due to the diversity of personal preference in not just air soft but the firearm community... however, this item is the only exception to my rule.  I got this speed loaded to compliment my MP5 with a 100-round drum and anyone with Carpel-Tunnel Syndrome can testify to, it's a real pain to load THAT much one at a time.  To satisfy this problem, enter the speed loader. ---  --- Pretty simple design and execution; open top hatch and insert up to 120 airsoft rounds, place nozzle on top of magazine and prime accordingly.  That easy.  Easily loads a 30-round magazine in less than three seconds.  It's inexpensive and easy to replace if it breaks... which it shouldn't unless you took it in the field and was dumb enough to put it in your front pouch and cracked it when you dove for cover.  Sounds ridiculous but I've seen it done by the Air Force guys I play with. ---  --- But let's face it; if you only have so many magazines/drums you're going to want a speed loader to make emergency quick-loads in the field and what better way than to carry it with you.  I strongly suggest you carry it in a side pouch; I carry mine in my BDU pant leg pocket below my hip holster for easy access although I try to carry more magazines in my tactical vest to avoid using it as a last resort.  I strongly recomend against placing it in a pouch in front of you like in a tactical vest since it's made of plastic, not metal.   ---  --- Lastly a warning; don't go too overboard with the primer.  Sometimes if you're not watching it you'll overload the magazine/drum and spray airsoft all over whereever you happen to be and either you've wasted ammo or you have to clean it up... unless you're at a friends house, let them clean it up.  ;
I purchased these shoes for my upcoming wedding because I have a hard time walking in really high heels. They are extremely cute but the satin ribbon ankle strap doesn't hold my foot firmly in the shoe. When I walked around in them, I could feel them "flopping". Also, anytime I raised my foot (to simulate my fiance taking off the garter) there was too much gap between my foot and the shoe. So, just be aware of this if you decide to purchase this shoe. For the price, this is not worth the buy
This was a gift for my daughter. Instead of receiving the New Yorker, she is receiving People. You need to fix this
I can't believe that no one else has reviewed this dvd. take advantage of the low price and BUY THIS NOW! i'm no expert on the HOT ROD scene, but this was very enjoyable. The footage of pinstripe artist SKRATCH is worth the price alone. ---     I would say anyone who is into watching creative people do something artistic and original will really love this. you get to see the creative process of some great project cars, as well as getting into the motivation of some of the builders and car club members. I will definitely be watching this one a few times
After having my GPS come loose (barrel pin failure) on more than one occasion I decided to give this a try.  --- I've now used this on a 2 month MTB tour of Nepal and Tibet. Held my Forerunner 301 securely on hundreds of miles of washboard, technical singletrack, etc. Also withstood countless grabby children and curious bystanders in numerous villages.  --- You do NOT have to remove the wrist band to use it with the mount. I love the reassuring "snap" when it locks into the mount, and the wrist strap functions as a safety back up - although it never came loose from the mount on me. Convenient release allows you to remove it quickly and easily. My only very minor complaint is you have to remove the GPS from the mount to charge it. --- It fit perfectly on my 1" (25.6mm) diameter bars. --- Like it so much I just ordered the "oversize" mount for my motorcycle.
When I first heard this album I was a bit shocked.  Myself and my fellow TMBG fans derided it as a "teen angst album," moaned and whined that John & John had betrayed us by adding a band, and generally refused to give it a chance. --- A few years later, listening to my entire collection of TMBG in chonological order (a sanity-restoration ritual), I realized that this album is AWESOME! --- There are only 2 stupid songs, Window and DirtBike.  Hey, for TMBG, that's not bad - their fans forgive them stupidity on a regular basis.   --- Aside from that, there are more rockin', thought-provoking tunes here than you'll find almost anywhere.  This album establishes beyond a doubt that TMBG are among the most gifted songwriters in rock history. --- I'm not going to go over each individual song - there are millions of TMBG fans who have and will.  I will add my 2 cents about my 4 favorites however: --- "I Should be Allowed to Think" - TMBG does justice to beat poetry, and beyond! --- "Why Must I Be Sad?" - Funny and pissy, great for getting those pesky emotions unstuck.  The lyrics are genius, subtly quoting the best of Alice Cooper with tongue firmly planted in cheek. --- "A Self Called Nowhere" - Righteous, angry, and breathtaking.   Angsty punk bands of the world, take note: you will NEVER be this hardcore. --- "The End of the Tour" - I have written in my last wishes that I want this one played at my funeral.  One of the most moving and emotionally honest rock ballads ever written. ---  --- If your idea of TMBG is songs like "Istanbul" and "Particle Man," get over it!  And give this album a chance! 
My son is a very active 2 yr old and very hard on toys, and these are great. Thick plastic construction. Easy enough for him to hook them up himself. We have 2 different kinds and they are both super
I enjoy Starbuck's version w/melon flavor in latte and frapuccino. At home I just blend mine with vanilla soy milk which I think tastes awesome
Cult Classic ...this is a loners movie ..I think we have all had times in our lives when we felt like kowalski..thats what makes this movie so authentic...What ever happened to Barry Newman ..does anyone remember "Petrocelli" ..the TV series Barry newman played a Private Detective and he was Building his home Block by Block himself in the Nevada Desert?.
I heard this song on the radio the first time many months ago (and then for months and months it's been played nonstop).  I instantly hated it from the horrendous beat to the fact that Gwen Stefani is a 35 year old dressed up as a cheerleader with pom-poms and about 95% of the song is spent on the chorus "I ain't no hollaback girl" or "This s*** is bananas" section.  Pharell is a master producer and I chuckled because I thought that even the Neptunes can produce an occasional flop.  To my horror this song became the number one single for multiple weeks and became the most successful single of the entire summer (maybe even the entire year).  I don't see what people like about this song but apparently there is something I'm missing.  Like I said you either hate it or love it
I am extremely impressed with the feel, look and general quality of the watch.  It contains the Citizen Miyota 21 jewel automatic movement that is a true workhorse for a fraction of the price.  The comfortable stainess steel pinned link bracelet is worth the price of the watch. It has rounded flexible brushed steel wrist links The foldover adjustable double safety clasp uses pins as well. Can easily be mistaken for a watch costing much more.  The Mineral Glass crystal is scratch resistant - but not as good as a sapphire watch face, but is less prone to chipping or shattering than a sapphire crystal. The display watchback is also mineral glass - displaying the undecorated Miyota automatic movement. It look as stylish and run as well as my other watches, and, I receive as many comments if not more from the Invicta's.  It is a great looking watch!  Good value, accurate and stylish if you like the Sub' look. This is a good day-to-day knock about watch that still looks better than the quartz stuff in the same price band. If it lasts 5 years it's more than paid for itself
This is a good example of the kind of scope astronomers warn beginners away from. ---  --- The first red flag is the ridiculously high advertised magnification of "600x." Do you know what you will see at 600x in this scope? Nothing but a dim blur. Note that the objective (main) lens is 60mm. All telescope optics have inherent limitations; maximum useful magnification per millimeter of aperture is about 2x. Therefore, with any attempt to use this scope at magnification of over 120-140x, the increase in image size will be more than offset by breakdown, and that's even assuming the quality of the objective lens is any good.  ---  --- The finder is useless; a 6x30 is barely adequate, and this is not even that big.  Finding any object other than the moon will be an exercise in frustration.  the 1 1/4" size of the eyepiece is creditable, but too high a mignification for this scope.  And the field of view is in doubt, and don't even think of using the barlow.  Buy this scope, and after a few outings, it will most likely sit in the attic.  The review immediately before mine is correct. This is no way to get started in astronomy. ---  --- In a way, it is hard to fault Celestron for making and marketing this scope. Their upper-tier instruments are quite good, but the big money appears to be made on mass market toys like this. In one sense the sale of these scopes subsidizes their good models. Just make sure, gentle reader, to stay away from the toys.  ---  --- Using an astronomical telescope is not like playing an MP3 file and but rather like playing a guitar. It is a learned skill. And you must do a lot of homework before you buy a telescope. Buying without prior experience is like buying a car without knowing anything about driving. If you want to see the wonders of the sky, contact your local astronomy club and attend one of their star parties. The members love sharing their hobby and can set you straight as to how to get started. The best way is to learn the sky with the unaided eye and 10x50 binoculars (decent ones are available on this website), then graduate to something along the lines of a 150-200mm (6-8") Dobsonian; Celestron's own 6" Starhopper can be found on Amazon for under $290. ---  --- For more information on buying telescopes, see my encyclopedic guide on Amazon: "So you want to buy a telescope.
Same thing that happened to the previous poster happened to my son's toy.  The turtle cup came off after the first use (and within 20 min!).  My son is 8 months old and it can't even withstand the pulling of an 8 month old.  And a sharp screw is revealed when the cup comes off.  Luckily we noticed it before my son was injured, unfortunately I had to remove it immediately which of course upset my son, who no longer had his toy to play with.  I would pay more for something that is quality so it is sad and amazing that companies put out cheap quality products that break immediately and expose dangerous parts.  I would recommend that you do not buy this item.  I now have to waste more time returning it to the store
After twice sending the unit back to the factory, the unit worked for two weeks and again would not turn on.  I tried all the suggestions made by the factory.  The following year I opened the unit and tried to see what was wrong.  I found totally frozen fan bearings.  I suppose that the cartriges to repel mosquitoes are corrosive and corroded the bearings.  To end my agonies with the unit, I took it to the garbage dump.  The unit is cheaply made and therefore unreliable.  When it worked, it worked well.  I believe it cost me about one dollar per killed mosquito
I received this tweezer for Christmas, so I'm glad I didn't spend anything for it because it's not even worth 50 cents.  The tweezer portion does not grip on to any hairs.  It's a piece of crap as far as I'm concerned. Do not bother purchasing this product, if you do, you'll regret it
Exceptional value in a classy and understated design. Keeps time in a superior fashion Highly recommended
I had my knife for 10 years, and would still have it, if not for the 2nd instinct of putting it in my back pocket whenever I leave the house. One night I was heading for a flight, at the airport, going thru security; when I realized I had it on me, I had no choice but to throw it out. So had to get another one
The watch winder is very quiet and inexpensive.  However, the quality is suspect - one side stopped rotating after a week.  You probably get what you pay for. Too much hassle and does not make economic sense to ship back and incur international shipping charges
it is not much live, color is to dark,and 2 songs are missing # 16, # 17(Kalimba De Luna)..go bey Boney M GOLD 20 super hits it is the best *****
My son loves this instrument, but I think he likes another saxophone that plays tunes when you press buttons better. This one relies on the child to blow and press the keys, like a real instrument, but doesn't sound like a saxophone
Thankfully I checked this out of the library and did not spend money on it.  I felt the need to add a review though to spare those who might be thinking of buying it.  I made it through the CD once with my kids, but that was it.  We will not be listening again.  As others have said, go buy the Radio Disney CDs (or possibly later version of KidzBop if they come with better reviews).  The singers (kids AND adults!)on KidzBob are out of tune and just painful to listen to.   
I haven't completed the book yet, but so far have found it to be very insightful and enjoyable.  It begins in Genesis and continues from there hitting on the most commonly read Bible sections to the not so often or  seldom read sections.  He ends everyday with a thought provoking question  to think on through out the rest of your day. I always look for to the next  reading
(...)This CD is sub-par.  Most of the beats are cool, but they're overlayed with too many cheesy lyrics
Very simple to install if you need a new starter.  However, after installing a new starter, new burner tubes, and new flavorizer bars (all easy), I discovered that something was wrong with one of the valves in my manifold.  I recommend this kit highly if you need a new starter, but make sure you actually need one.  First turn the gas on and spray Windex (easier than soapy water) over everything that might be leaking
As if the song for mesmerize was'nt bad enough. A F***'IN GREASE VIDEO???!!!! Ja officially became a diva with this album. This album is horrible. The pledge had some life due to Nas appearance, thats why it's hard for me to request a zero star rating. Bottomline if Ja's body was made up of his albums, this part would gangrene, maggots would avoid this and you should too
I love the look. Even my friends complement it. And the wedges are so LIGHT! But you got to stick to your size. I couldn't find size 8.5 so I bought size 9 instead which was a big mistake.
There are bugs in the tea bags. Now, these aren't the 'organic' bugs you find in your garden when you plant veggies. These are the bugs that dig into expired produce. There are about 4-5 bugs in each bag. If you want some protein boost while relaxing before you go to bed, this is the product to buy. Also, the tea bags aren't made from organdy. It's some sort of plastic/polyester. I burnt a bag and it melted, turned black, and glued onto itself. Horrible, unethical company
I had a previous Expedition watch that lasted many years and served me well. I purchased this new version and so far haven't been disappointed. If you're looking for a basic watch that tells time and has a backlight, I don't think you can go wrong for the money
Excellent movie that shows how families should be and how most African American families really are. Big Mama's are always the most important component to a family. Definitely a collector's item.
Very Comfortable and easy to use.  Very easy to fall asleep in, just make sure to tie yourself to something
They sounded good, but aren't tart enough for my taste and are prepared with too much sugar
I've had my headset for about a month now.  As noted by another reviewer, this headset does not come with any buttons or switches - the only thing on the cord is a shirt clip.  6 different ear gels are included to accomodate different ears, which is nice (though I've only ever used one).  The headset is very easy to slip into my ear (only takes 1 second) and is comfortable for up to 2 hours of wear (at which point my ear starts to get a little sore).  My boyfriend reported a similar experience with other headsets that use ear gels.  If you regularly stay on the phone longer than 2 hours, it's something to keep in mind.  However, it suits my needs just fine, and for the low price, I think it's really a great buy
Our 5 year old hated riding her bike with training wheels because she felt like it was too tippy and we wondered if she would ever figure it out.  Then we found this one & got it for her for Christmas and she *loves* it.  After 3 months she can now ride a traditional bike with NO training wheels and she was the youngest on the block to do so.  It is all due to this bike.  I never would have believed it since she was *petrified* of riding a bike WITH training wheels before.  And when the other girls on the block took off their training wheels, there were lots of tears & they screamed for their training wheels back!   And their parents had to run along side them for days trying to teach them how to balance but our daughter just took off and we didn't even have to help her. ---  --- Now we are loaning out the Scoot so the other kids can learn to balance too!  In fact I just ordered our 3 year old a bike with pedals & I'm pretty sure he can ride without the training wheels too, the way that he speeds around on the Scoot!  It was well worth the purchase
Men's Health is one of the most popular men's magazines because it meets the various expectations and needs of the modern man. You simply have to know about fitness, dieting, supplements, fashion, gadgets, etc. The annual subscription makes it a bargain and you get so much information for a few bucks. One of the most interesting sections is the one dedicated to bedroom activities. The tips are definitely useful and yet I highly recommend in addition the bestseller "scientifically guaranteed male multiple orgasms and ultimate sex" for the latest secrets in this area. Another key feature of the magazine is that it motivates you to stay healthy, lean and fit. There are weight loss tips, advice on how to eat and exercise in order to see results fast. This is important part of keeping sharp appearance. Overall, I can reasonably say that you will learn a lot, have fun reading it and most probably it will help you up to a certain limit to be a good looking man and great lover
We received this product for Christmas in 2005 and within two weeks the console broke. We contacted Schwinn immediately and was told we would receive a replacement console. It is now May 1st and the console we need is still on backorder --- 5 MONTHS!!!!! It is absolutely ridiciulous. I call each week and I get the same response. ---  --- Unfortunately, we should have contacted Amazon within the 30 day period to get reconciliation from Amazon. Lesson learned there. ---  --- The product when it was working was fine. But the pain since then is not worth it.  ---  --- I do not recommend this product
Wild Orchid.  Most people think its some smut movie with no plot.  No one ever looks between the lines.  It may have sex, and some crazy acting, and even a bogus plot, but the theme of it is important.  True love.  Call me sentimental and a hopeless romantic, but this movie touched me.  Emily and Wheeler, opposites in every way, somehow find love, together.  I wish everyone was as lucky.  To find happiness where you least expect it.  I wish I could be as happy as those two.  Look around you.  Do you see people with this kind of passion and love?  It's sad, too, because we know what happened to the actors who played these lovers.  I hope that someone out there has a relationship like this so that we have more to cling to then fiction.  It may not have been the best movie, but it had an important message:  When you find true love grab it with both hands and never let go. 
Having recently built a digital picture frame from scratch, I was excited when someone gave us this frame for xmas, to see what a commercial frame would be like. After using it for a few weeks, I have to say that if it wasn't a present I would return it and get one that was built by people who had some sense of innovation. ---  --- The Good:  --- * Screen is bright, images look great --- * Resolution is only 640x480 but it will play images up to 10 megapixel and they look pretty good to me. Doesn't seem like you need much higher resolution than that on such a small screen.  --- * Computer connection worked great - I plugged it into my xp box, all drivers installed automatically without the need for a cd and then 4 new removable drives showed up. It would be nice if only the drives with a card in them showed up but this is a minor issue. ---  --- The bad:  --- My main complaint about this picture frame is that the people who made it obviously had no interest in making the sort of product that you enjoy using because it is clear that the inventor appreciated why such a product would be fun to have or what makes it an improvement over what was there before. If I bought this frame in 1999 or if it cost $50, I could have forgiven it for the poor design, but in 2007, for $180, it is completely unacceptable.  We live in the future here people, get with the program!   ---  --- I have not used other frames on the market, but given that you can buy an old tablet pc with a 12" screen on ebay for $70, strap it into a cheap frame and make your own, pc-based screen that works 100 times better than this frame, just by running a screen saver for under $150, I'd say this frame is not worth the money at all. This screen just doesn't deliver the goods for the price. ---  --- Some details: --- * Menu system is insanely poorly designed - for instance, you have to be in a specific menu to adjust the system settings - pushing the "setup" button at any other time does nothing despite the fact the the setting are global --- * Remote control only works when you are standing about a foot from the computer and pointing it directly at the tiny IR hole in the front of the screen. --- * Screen only works as a horizontal frame - there is no way set it up as a vertical frame (i.e. as a 480x640 frame) because the frame automatically rotates vertical images and there is no way to turn this "feature" off. --- * The slowest slideshow speed setting is 1 minute between images. Your only other option is to have it just be on 1 image that doesn't change. --- * No way to connect remotely to the computer or to easily  --- get images onto the frame without having to take the frame to where your computer is or go through a tedious process with a memory card an the crappy menu system. --- * Good viewings angles are limited but this is a general problem with lcd screens
I received this printer a few days ago and I am very impressed. 4 X 6 photos look awesome as if I had Walmart print them and the speed is very fast. I hook it up to my Airport Extreme Base Station (I use a Powerbook) and print wirelessly and had no problems at all. Scanner is a tad bit noisy but a lot quieter than my old HP All in one printer that just kicked the bucket. ---  --- The software is easy to use and understand. I never read the directions and I was scanning in pictures with in minutes. I also like the LCD display on the printer. Its nice to just "pop" in a memory card, and view the photos you want to print. It saves time when you don't have to download them to the computer then print them. ---  --- Overall I am vey pleased and I did my search on this printer and all of the reviews were very good. I was torn between Canon (I actually bought a Canon Pixma and returned it) and HP and I am glad I stuck with HP, always a trusted brand. And the price was about $40.00 dollars cheaper than any electronics store around. ---  --- Pros: --- Excellent picture qualty --- Fast printing --- Easy setup --- A lot of features --- Easy to use and understand functions ---  --- Cons: --- Scanner a litte noisy (quieter than my old HP) --- When printing the printer shakes my table (old HP did the same) --- I guess it is a little on the large side, but it doesn't bother m
I enjoyed this game quite a bit--I ended up putting all of the other games I was playing aside to just finish this one.  You play as the three Baudelaire kids.  The story follows the 2004 Lemony Snicket film fairly closely, as you must first escape Count Olaf's decrepit mansion, then avoid being killed by a train before you head off to Uncle Monty's herpetology paradise, Aunt Josephine's seaside town, and finally save Violet Baudelaire from a fate worse than death.  The environments are attractive and fun to explore, and the game play and puzzles are neither too easy nor too challenging and frustrating. ---  --- For most of the game--as you explore environments, solve puzzles, search for secret rooms and such, you can switch between Violet and Klaus Baudelaire as you please.  For many "important" events, such as boss fights, you must play as one or the other, as they each have different skills and weapons.  For some sequences--those that are basically 2D platformer sections (the entire game has some platformer aspects, but it's usually loosely employed and 3D), you must play as Sunny, the baby Baudelaire (and this is the only time you can play as her). ---  --- The various puzzles and challenges--they almost amount to a series of "mini-games", are varied and mostly non-repetitive, helping retain your interest.  Some are fairly easy to figure out and perform, but some are appropriately more challenging, both mentally and in terms of manipulating the controller, and take many tries to complete.  A couple first-person shooter sequences (the game is mostly in a third person mode), are especially challenging, particularly the end, but that's the final boss fight, so that's to be expected.  Like most games, winning boss fights requires discerning patterns in the bosses and adapting a strategy appropriate to the pattern, which takes both brains and manual dexterity. ---  --- There are a couple negatives with the game, but they are minor.  Games like this, released in response to the success of a film, are often rushed through production.  That becomes evident here in the cut scenes, which are not very exciting--they feature 2D black and white sketches that are more like a slide show as major portions of the story are read to us.  But I'd rather have skimping done in cut scenes than in game play, and that's just what was done here.  Also, although the graphics are wonderful for the most part, the visuals are a bit dark overall--I found it best to play with the lights off.  With a bright overhead light on, the glare was too much to see important information in the game.  Finally, I would have preferred a different save game scheme, as you can only save when the game asks if you want to, and the save points seem almost random.  Sometimes you can save after accomplishing only one more minor task.  Sometimes you have to do long sequences (and sometimes a number of challenging ones) before you can save again. ---  --- The game isn't quite as funny as the film and doesn't have exactly the same "magical" atmosphere, but it is an engaging and fun journey to another world.  The soundtrack, by Jeremy and Julian Soule, and inspired by Thomas Newman's great soundtrack for the film, is also a major asset--I found myself wanting to explore levels again later on as much to hear the music again as anything else
When we traveled in Belgium some years ago, we were constantly tempted by chocolate.  There was a Godiva store on every corner with uniform overstuffed waxy tasting chocolates.  Someone suggested we try Leonidas, and it was a revelation!! Half the  price of Godiva's chocolates and lightyears more flavorful and more like the artisanal chocolates that are so popular now.  The flavors were more interesting, the finish more refined, and the dark chocolate more full of cocoa bitterness and depth.  Leonidas is IT as far as Belgian chocolates are concerned
I got a chance to play with one of these last week. The external speaker is very loud, the controls are easy to use and best of all, it comes with a 1GB card. My only gripe is the slide feels a little loose; I felt like I was always going to open it up by mistake. All in all a killer phone and the MP3 capability/software is a lot better than my KRZR
I bought this machine at Michael's (craft store) for use with Polymer Clay.  The machine was very poorly made and broke on the second day of use!  The "clamp" that helps hold it to the table did not fit properly so I had to borrow some of my husband's clamps so it wouldn't move around....but then, while using it, the dials (that gauge the thickness of the clay) completely broke. ---  --- I returned it and am going to get a nicer Atlas machine.  Don't waste your time with this one....you'll only be disappointed and frustrated with it
Bought this as a gift for my granson.  It is awesome.  Many games to pick from and the ease of use is great.  He's only five and works the buttons with ease.  Plus you can take it anywhere.  Great price here too. Cheaper than anyone else
This is a wonderful mag.  More things should be literary yet down to earth like this journal.  Without a doubt this is one of the best places to find great fiction and poetry
My husband and I bought two of these to take on a cruise for our snorkling outting. Due to weather, the snorkeling was canceled, but we did end up using the cameras.  One we used for regular pictures, outdoor only, beacuse there's no flash, and it was okay, though the pictures were a bit grainy. The other I took on a camping trip with some high school kids and the camera jammed a few pictures into the roll, I could turn and turn the winder, and the film wouldn't advance, but it would let me take another picture. After fighting with it the entire weekend, I ended up getting about 10 pictures that could be made out, though these were grainy, too
This lip gloss is super!!!  Not only does it glide on your lips, it has staying power.  The colors are so subtle and pretty.  It is worth every penney and I will not waste my money on cheaper, sticky and short-lived lip glosses
My baby and I just LOVE IT!!!! It is so easy to bath her now and SO MUCH FUN! I started bathing her everyday in this bathtub and it is just awesome. She plays with her toys and has tons of fun. The side where her head rests is lifted so she can safely lay down and relax. After her bath, I just empty the tub and hang it in a knob in our bathroom until the next day. I really recommend it, it is super practical.(Please never leave your baby unattended
great monthly information on the latest design trends and figures. Sadly it only comes 2x's a year
Outstanding cleaner for your CD or CDRW, MP3 player.  Takes you through many diagnostic tests.  Even has a Dolby test.  Well worth the money and you will be more than pleased with it.  I used it on both my PC CD and CDRW drives as well as my stereo CD player.  Fantastic product!!
Even though this costs a bit more, its worth every penny! It is so easy to put in the buggy! My son is comfy and fits in it very well!
I ordered these for my 21 year old daughter who attends Juilliard.  They looked terrible because they were shiney.  The worst part is that the company will not allow a return or exhange. 
Normally I might wait to install a new software upgrade, but I just got a new laptop and thought it would be best to use Office 2007 with the new Vista operating system. I was wrong. ---  --- You would expect that a multi-billion dollar company like Microsoft could put out a powerful and bug-free piece of software. But after a month of using Office 2007, you get the distinct impression that this software is not ready for public release. Microsoft should be ashamed. ---  --- I don't know the root cause of my problems, but I have to stress that I am running a clean install of Office 2007 on Vista, so there shouldn't be any software conflicts or issues.  ---  --- So what are my issues? The list is long: ---  --- -- My biggest concern is that MS Word constantly hangs and stalls. It can making editing a document very painful. I suspect the problem is when I put images or Visio diagrams into a document. But that is something the old MS Word was able to do without an issue. Oddly, if I have a colleague open the document and save it out in Word 2003, the problem goes away! What?! It's killing my productivity. ---  --- -- When ever I cut and paste from an old document, Word hangs for 15 to 20 seconds. And often the formatting and margins in my new document go haywire. I keep having to spend a ton of time fixing things. This never happened in the old Word. This is another time killer. ---  --- -- Every few days, Outlook 2007 starts telling me that it cannot display my email folders. Uh oh! I have to completely restart my computer to see my email again. ---  --- -- Outlook 2007 breaks many graphic emails that people send -- they look like a mess. It is because Outlook 2007 does NOT render HTML correctly since it uses the Word engine, not Internet Explorer to display email. I have no idea why Microsoft did this, but they have got to fix it. ---  --- -- Many of the issues in the old Word 2003 still haven't been fixed. If you place an image, it can often be hard to get it to appear correctly. Why can't they solve this one? ---  --- -- While most Office programs have the new ribbon interface (which I like), some programs like Visio 2007 do not. So you have to remember how to use two interfaces. Couldn't Microsoft find the time and money to update ALL its programs? Give me a break. ---  --- -- On a few occassions in Visio 2007, my files have failed to save correctly. At first I thought this must have been my fault, but it's happened to me a few times and can't be a coincidence. A few times I've gotten an error message and lost my work. Ug. ---  --- -- Word and Excel 2007 use a completely new file format. So anyone you send a document to has to have 2007 installed (which isn't likely the case). To get around this, you can save it down to a 2003 file format, but then you end up with two files on your hard drive -- one in the new format and one in the old format. What a pain! Also, there definitely seems to be an issue with Office 2007 opening older Office 2003 files. Could be the cause of many of my problems, but there is no way I can avoid using old files. They should have worked harder on compatibility. ---  --- There are good things about the new 2007. I do like the new interface design and the new features in Outlook 2007 are amazing for organizing tasks and sharing your calendar. ---  --- But I don't think it's fair that Microsoft released a product so full of serious, serious bugs that have cost me hours and hours of extra work. I didn't spend hundreds of dollars on a beta product and don't think the public should have to suffer. Surely they can afford to do better!
I had high hopes for this battery for my Nikon camera.  It promised more MAH than the OEM battery that came with the camera.  Unfortunately, it must be leaking electrons all over the place, since a charge in this model does not compare to the original.  I would guess that the charge lasts half the life of the original Nikon battery.  The price was cheap and you get what you pay for.  If you are going to purchase this one, get two since you'll need to keep one charging while using the other.  Cheers
I upgraded from Wordperfect Office 12 to X3, but have returned the upgrade to Wordperfect.  The much touted ability to import PDF files is so poorly implemented that it is all but unusable.  In addition, the Wordperfect Mail component will not load data files while my antivirus (ZoneAlarm) is running in the background.  Corel Technical Support takes no responsibility for the incompatability.  Do not upgrade unless these issues are addressed
I like this one better than Cosmo.  Great info on beauty and the like
I have always thought that a man's shaver would work on woman's beard.  This one does not.
I love this cereal.  I like the slightly sweet wheaty taste, and the fact that it holds its crunch in milk for a long time.  I also snack on it dry.  It stays with me for a long time, keeping me from eating junk
Foams nicely in the tub, rinses away cleanly.  Skin isn't left with any film.  Instead, your skin is left very soft and with a good scent.  Falling in love smells sweet and relaxing, and makes me think of cotton candy.  The large bottle lasts quite a while as a bath gel but goes considerably quicker if you choose to use it as a shower gel.  Recommend you use it with a loofah in the shower
I have used the bottle to take tasty beverages with me on the road, while playing sports, to drink while I am in class.  The bottle washes easily in the dishwasher.  The narrower profile fits easily in cup holders.  I highly reccommend the N-Gen.  It is much larger than 24 oz.  If you fill it all the way to the top you have nearly a quart of capacity.  It is the best functioning and looking drink bottle on the market.  You can also use the bottle as I have to pack small items which you want to be slightly more secure while traveling by air and also keeping some items out of the rain in your backpack. 
I love knowing the exact time (even if my mom thinks I am crazy), and it works like a... clock! I never have issues with the updates (in Illinois), but I do have a few minor issues: the watch is too thick (5/8 inch), the band is made for a gorilla and is very difficult to adjust for a human, the buttons are hard to press, and the manual is too small and hard to read. Still, if I had a choice between this watch or my borhter's Rolex, I will take his Rolex and exchange it for 40 Casios. Thank you, Casio
This review is more about the Hi-MD concept in general than one particular player. --- The sound quality was excellent.  The rest of the product and concept deserves to die in the marketplace. ---  --- Complaints: --- -The only thing that isn't proprietary is the headphone jack and the AA battery.  Beyond that, Sony's dual role as a content provider (complete with nasty intellectual property lawyers) and equipment manufacturer fatally compromises usuability of this line of players.  No Macintosh support is just the beginning.  Proprietary compression algorithms. Weird and twisted upload/download rules.  Wrong choices made at every point of the PRD process. ---  ---  --- -100x recording speed?  Make that 4x on a good day.  100x speed is a specification that should attract the attention of Elliot Spitzer, if he only cared. ---  --- -The players are flimsy.  Just walking with mine caused it to skip.  And one hard fall to the floor and it stopped working entirely.  Sony will charge you to honor the warranty (parts only--no labor).  By contrast Apple replaced my daughter's iPod no questions asked when it started developing hard disk hiccups. ---  --- -Trying to find Hi-MDs offers the thrill of the hunt, if you're into that kind of thing.  But their rarity suggests that Sony is at best half-hearted about supporting this device. ---  --- I used to be a loyal Sony customer, but now believe they have gone almost irretrievably downhill.  Sleek designs do not compensate for disfunctional product management and shoddy manufacturing.  In fact, I'm planning an HD TV purchase next year and have Sony far down on the list of possibilities.  You can find better quality and value almost anywhere else these days. ---  --- Howard, are you listening
I ordered this doll for my 3 year old grandaughter who wanted nothing else for Christmas and even though the stores were sold out, she was sure that Santa could get it for her. When my daughter called to make SURE that I had it actually in hand - I said SURE - I ordered it from Amazon!  After all, the description said that was the SWIMMING Mermaid...that it would swim as soon as you put it in the water.  IT IS NOT!!!!  Like the other lady said - it is Just another Barbie doll in a green dress.  Now I will have to pay a premium to get it from Ebay (where I could have gotten it for less a week ago) and also have to pay express shipping and hope it gets here before Christmas. I will have pay 6 times what I paid for this deception and hope that Santa can get it here in time so that my grandaughter is not disappointed.  Beware of this seller!  I see that he has now removed the word swimming from the description.  Believe me - it was there before
Extremely dissapointed in the colors I received.  Out of 10, 6 were black, 3 red (2 shades), 1 pink.  I could deal with 6 blacks and 4 different (and I mean different - not all red-toned) colors, but not with what I got.  Useless. ---  --- I'm upset beyond words.  Will never buy from this seller again, and will not recommend to anyone I know, unless the seller comes through and fixes this
If you have read the Conversations with God books, then you will enjoy this movie about the incredible journey that brought Neale Donald Walsh to where he is today. --- Very inspiring
I first caught The Black Swan several years ago on television and was immediately blown away. Sure, it's just a Swashbuckler, just a Pirate film - with the usual plot, the usual bits and pieces. There's nothing outrageously distinctive about The Black Swan, at least at first sight. Ty Power stars as Jamie Boy, expert pirate who ends up by plot machinations in the employ of ex-pirate and now governer of Jamaica, Captain Morgan Laird Cregar). Morgan's been given a pardon for his dastardly deeds and with his new title attempts to rid the seas of the dastardly buccaneers, sending Jamie Boy off to find George Sanders' Captain Leech. Only there's a twist in the mix - and some dastardly fop's out to make a mockery of Morgan by using Leech as his private pirate to ruin the governer. To make matters worse Jamie not only seemingly disappears - apparently in league with the nefarious Leech, but he also kidnaps the previous governer's daughter, played with feistyness by Catherien O'Hara.....  ---  --- So it's all the usual stuff - kidnapping, sword-fighting, stealing, drinking, pacts with arch enemies and stock characters throughout. But you know what - it's not that you know what you're getting, it's that you get a whole lot more than you ever thought you would. Sure, everything's the same, but somehow strangely different. The story and characters are as seen before - but with the likes of Sanders, Power and O'Hara as the love interest, and the great character actor Cregar playing against type - you have life breathed into the character's that's so often lacking. And the original story by one Rafael Sabatini - who also brought us Captain Blood and The Sea Hawk - is a rip-roaring boys-own adventure.  ---  --- Director Henry King - no stranger to producing similar adventure styled flicks - cracks the picture along with some sense of urgency. It's a spare, fluid film with a simple, but fun, narrative and visual splendour that puts other films, even those made today, out to pasture.  ---  --- This DVD manages to capture that splendour in abundance - the technicolor photography is gorgeously rendered herein, with all of the detailed production and costune design seen at its best. Just check out the restoration comparison to see how good. In addition the disc also features a fine commentary from historian Rudy Behlmer. ---  --- If you want a cracking piece of entertainment that puts shame to modern counterparts of the genre, look no further
I actually bought this netting to use as a cover for our baby's cradle (we have two cats and didn't want them to nap in it while the baby wasn't in it).  I've used it once for my Pak n' Play while outside but found it especially useful when my daughter fell asleep in her jogging stroller after a walk in our neighborhood.  Since it was such a nice day I let her nap in in the stroller(it fully reclines) with netting covering the entire stroller.  I feel, that for such a low price, this netting is worth it for whatever reason you chose to use it for
Paper Mario: The thousand year door is an awesome game! One time I played it for 4 hours straight, but your probubly wondering about the game, not me. Well, first of all, I would say this is a very creative game for everyone. The music and replay value arent to good, but it is definantly made up by the awesome gameplay, graphics, characters, and story. It made me laugh a few times and it was GREAT FUN when you first play it all the way through. The way it does battling is similar to pokemon, but a bit more complicated, but it is really fun. I realy like the punies and TEC the computer and yoshie. The bad guys are the X-nauts and I beat the crud out of them for what they did to TEC. As always, I highly recomend this game to anyone with a gamecube for someone who wants a pretty long and a bit of a challenging game
WOW! This was a pretty decent romantic comedy. We had this in our collection for months (Possibly years) and never watched it. We decided to watch this film on a whim. I have to say that it was better and ever funnier than I thought it would be. ---  --- Monica Potter is great in her role. It's a sweet movie that actually doesn't do to much guy bashing (the reason so many guys hate romantic comedies). I am also a big fam of Henry Thomas, and he is great at as well. ---  --- I won't go into the plot here, as many others already have. But what I am simply amazed with as many bad romantic comedies that get released in theatres (Sweet Home Alabama & 13 Going on 30) that a movie like this never got mainstream attention.  ---  --- The other thing that must be said is, with virtually no cute romatic female leads under 40 (and over 18), why isn't Monica Potter more famous than she is. She can easily be the next Julia Roberts, or Meg Ryan. Julia has 2 kids and Meg has just hit the wall, it's time for a beauty like Monica Potter to get into the very lucrative Romantic Comedy genre. Here's hoping she gets a better agent before it's to late. ---  --- Cute movie, with a good heart. Definetly made a date night at home wonderful. ---  --- -Mark --- (for the record 32yrs old, straight and yes I enjoyed this movie) --- 
The first time Final Fantasy V was releasd in America was with the Final Fantasy Anthology package.  Now the game is where it belongs.  On a handheld system.  The GBA is pretty much at the end of its life, but it still manages to get a satisfactory game every now and then.  Final Fantasy V is by no means the best in the series, but it is, for the most part, an RPG that deserves appreciation and acclaim.  ---  --- Final Fantasy V begins with a character named Bartz witnessing a meteorite come hurdling to the ground.  When he goes to investigate he meets up with Lenna.  Lenna is searching for her father who has gone off to the wind shrine to check on the wind crystal.  Lately, the wind has been weak, and it can only be because something is wrong with the wind crystal.  In addition to meeting Lenna, Bartz also meets Galuf, a man who has lost his memory in light of the meteorite crashing.  All he can remember is his name, and that he too must also go to the wind shrine.  Eventually Bartz decides to travel with them, and so your adventure begins. ---  --- In truth, Final Fantasy V doesn't have a good storyline... at least when compared to Final Fantasy IV and all the Final Fantasy games that appeared after the fifth installment.  It's pretty basic and generic.  This is obvious by how fast you'll meet your main party, and how much more emphasis is put on gameplay.  These characters are not well developed nor is the story full of unbelievable plot twists.  Except Final Fantasy V was not meant to be about storyline.  It's all about the gameplay, and that's where Final Fantasy V excels the most. ---  --- As with Final Fantasy IV before it, Final Fantasy V uses the ATB battle system.  All your characters stand on one side of the screen while all the enemies stand on the other.  When a character's ATB gauge fills up, you'll be able to issue commands.  The game then plays out in turn based fashion.  Final Fantasy V is simple, yet it's a lot of fun, and it also provides a challenge.  The gameplay is enhanced even more by the games complex job system.  ---  --- The job system is extremely complex, even by todays standards.  As you progress through the game you'll obtain job classes for your characters.  There are plenty of jobs.  Monks, thieves, white mages, black mages, and plenty more.  Each of them learn several different abilities all of which can and will be useful to you on your journey.  When you select a job with a certain character, you'll have to battle to earn ability points so that they can learn all the abilities they can.  Some abilities are more useful than others, and the possibilities are endless.  Also, once a character learns an ability, you can change jobs and have them equip it.  So a black mage could, in fact, use white magic, provided he's learned the ability to do it.   ---  --- You'll spend a lot of time on the field battling to get ability points.  The more abilities you learn, the more ability points you'll need for the next.  This is fine and all, but most enemies don't give up loads of ability points.  So the game puts a huge emphasis on battling.  This is also seen by the low amounts of experience enemies also give off.  Leveling up is a slow process.  The good news is battling is fun, especially with the job system in place.  Unless everyone's jobs are the same, there's a nearly endless possibility of commands you can give in the middle of battle. ---  --- Final Fantasy V Advance sports the same extras as all the previous Final Fantasy re-releases on the GBA do.  An extra dungeons and some extra bosses, and that's about it.  Nothing too big, but worth the price nonetheless.  It'll probably take you 20-30 hours to complete Final Fantasy V.  It's not filled to the brim with secrets like future Final Fantasy titles, but mastering all the jobs will really keep you busy for several hours alone.   It's also cool because along with the extra dungeons and bosses, you'll get four new job classes.  This only adds more to the already complex gameplay.   ---  --- Graphically, Final Fantasy V is a little dated, even by GBA standards.  It looks far better than it did in Final Fantasy Anthology.  It's much smoother and does have a little bit of an update, but it doesn't go the extra mile it could've.  Enemies still only flash to attack your characters, and they're hardly animated.  At least the game has a great soundtrack.  Final Fantasy V goes on to show why the Super Nintendo era for Final Fantasy music was one of the best in the series.  The game just sounds really good.   ---  --- Final Fantasy V is a golden treat for Final Fantasy fans.  It may have a weak storyline, but what it lacks in story it more than makes up for in gameplay.  It's not the best in the series, but it's still a really fun game. ---  --- The Good ---  --- +It's a lot of fun to play --- +The job system makes for a lot of variety in your party --- +Great music --- +The minor graphic updates are welcome --- +Bonus dungeons and bosses --- +There's a huge emphasis on gameplay ---  --- The Bad ---  --- -Not enough of a graphical update --- -Weak story and character
This is a really great scent, but it could of been better. I think it misses that extra zing you get when you test it on animals.  I mean seriously, animals want to smell nice too
This isn't a full review but some thoughts I've had after using it for a long time. --- Stabilization- The fact is that if this is the camera you take everywhere with you, you are going to either lose shots or have to use the flash. If flash doesn't bother you, no sweat. But I've never like the look of it. --- Ease-of-use- Great. --- Voice memo- I use this feature all the time. It would be nice if it had a pause button because without it I end up with many small files. --- Ex- This is where you set the exposure. Casio does a great job putting everything in one place. The only thing they should have done better is that if you have changed a selection (e.g. ISO 200 to 400) and hit the shutter release it should take the shot. Instead nothing happens. You have to click set first. It's an extra step that you have to make during a critical time
This device is useless for monitoring pulse during activity.  One must be absolutely still for the meter to get a clear signal.  Nor is it useful for monitoring resting pulse, as it seems unable to pick up a pulse unless the heart is pounding.  At best, this device MIGHT manage to acurately read a pulse AFTER a strenuous activity is concluded
I purchased six of these chairs in August for myself and my friends before the start of the college football season for tailgaiting.  They were all made by this manufacturer (North Pole) and had different NFL logos on them (I only bought one through Amazon, the others were bought through different companies due to availability issues). ---  --- At the first game of the season, my chair (Steelers) broke.  At the second game of the season, two more chairs (Bengals and Broncos) broke.  They were not misused and no weight limits were exceeded.  They all broke in the same exact place; the plastic pieces at the base of the legs all cracked.  Therefore, 3 out of 6 broke within probably less than 3-5 hours. ---  --- Needless to say, at $25-$30 each I would recommend prospective buyers to spend their money elsewhere
I purchased these about 1 month ago and used the "burn in" method of leaving my Grado running music for 6 days straight to open up the components in the headphones for good sound and was VERY impressed. I do have to say that they are a bit uncomfortable at first but its worth it for the good sound and the fact that the pads adjust and soften up after a while. It's also no where near as painful as my ordeal with my first pair of canalphones which were the E2c's(see my other reviews). ---  --- Anyways...on the subject of sound I have to say that its an all around winner with its smooth but punchy bass and its open soundstage which I guess results from the open ear design they have, and although some don't like the retro look of these phones I've really been gettin into them as of late, another big plus are the rotating cups and the thick cable which guarantee's a long life for these cans. I also gotta give Grado credit on it's expandability with amps and different cups which will leave me hunting  for new components seeing as I'm merely just a budding audiophile with a long way to go and a limited budget that wont let me upgrade my setup whenever I want(cries)... ---  --- P.S. ---  --- If you use these with your computer and there are pops and hisses its because the Grado are too good for the card which resulted in me buying a new 24bit external sound card from creative that gave me a REAL boost in sound quality. So overall these are a good pair of cans for someone who loves their music but just can't afford to buy the latest and greatest in the world of sound
I purchased what I thought were "deals" from 2 seperate vendors and was very disappointed.  ---  --- To get a pair of decent fitting sweats, you have to pay the price, and you won't regret it. ---  --- I hope this advice helps
I agree with many of the reviewers--in the mid range and wide angle the lens is superb, but it is not quite as sharp as a tele--as one of the reviewers said--it does many things, and not all of them perfectly--the lens is a compromise, but an excellent compromise--the VR is an added boost-- --- I'm still debating whether or not to keep it or send it back, because of the weakness in the tele-- but there is nothing else that can replace its versatility.--I don't want to keep changing lenses
First let it be said that this book leads you to believe that he hikes the whole trail... He does not. He hikes less than a third. You dont find this out until 2/3 through the book, which is right about when the book goes from passibly bad, to an ill effort to fulfill a contract.  ---  --- My conclusion on this book is that he was contracted to hike the trail by his publisher, could not, and stuffed the remainder of the book with verbatum history lessions and whole cloth inserts of useless statistics.  ---  --- As others have said in this review forum. This book can be snide, highschoolish and down right mean. I fail to see the "wit" in his endless negitivity and bashing.  ---  --- This book has a few funny parts, but I cant help but feel that it is a huge exageration of real events, and is mostly contrived fictional accounts which he uses to air is nasty comments. It is so unbelievible in places, that you know you are on an imagined tangent.  ---  --- Dont waste your money or time. I am so happy I bought it for 25 cents at a yard sale!
Without this memory card there is no fun. When you're playing a game for a few hours and get really far you will definitely wanna save it. Without the memory card you will have to do everything all over again. With the memory card you can save up and continue playing later.  ---  --- Really, that's all the information you need. Pick it up today
What a wonderful toy. The no volume control worried me, but it isn't that loud. Great value,Great toy
"Doctor Livingstone I presume?" is undoubtedly one of the most well known quotes in history.  Very few people, however, are familiar with the history underlying the meeting of Dr. David Livingstone and Henry Morton Stanley. ---  --- This book details the lives of the two men and the historical background through which they were thrown together.  Livingstone, one of the foremost explorers of his day is searching for the source of the Nile River.  Through a combination of bad luck, poor planning, disease, weather, natives, etc., Livingstone is virtually stranded on the banks of Lake Tangyanika. ---  --- Henry Stanley, a newspaper correspondent undertakes a rescue mission at the direction of his publicity hungry publisher.  This book details that mission and the international setting under which it took place.  The perils of African exploration in the late 19th century cannot be overstated.  This book does an excellent job impressing this upon the reader.   ---  --- I found this book very similar in style and experience to Undaunted Courage (which detailed the Voyage of Discovery undertaken by Lewis and Clark) and River of Doubt (dealing with Theodore Roosevelt's exploration of the Amazon basin.  If you enjoyed either of these books, you will like this one as well.  If you read this book and enjoy it, I highly recommend the other two
I had a previous generic charger that did not work. Well if you go with this one, you won't have to worry about that.  This one works like a charm and seems to charge pretty fast too.  I've had this for a while now, and never had any problems with it. --- 
It took a while to get this product but, it was worth the wait. The iron heats up quickly and easily. When you have arthritis like me, you appreciate the simplicities in this product. It heated up fast and safely AND it was so easy to grip the handle. It definitely styled my hair without over-processing it. Thanks
Chaturanga is the oldest known form of chess.  It dates back to India in the seventh century A.D.  Front Porch classics has carefully re-created this game and it is now available to everyone! ---  --- The game itself is beautiful.  It is played on a fabric playing board (all games were once played on fabric, it's extremely portable and cheap, and cardboard wasn't even invented until the late 1800's!).  Unlike chess, the game can be played with two to four players.  Each player gets 8 playing pieces, made of clay: A Raja, an elephant, a horse (cavalry), a ship and four infantrymen.  These pieces are kept in beautiful velvet bags.  Each piece does have a loose equivalent in modern chess.   ---  --- The Raja is the most important piece, much like the king.  The elephant acts much like the rook.  The ship is the bishop, and you cannot capture a Raja with the ship.  The Cavalry moves exactly like a knight.  The infantry, which in this game look kind of like tiny Buddhas in lotus position, are like the pawns.  The big difference between Chaturanga and chess is that Chaturanga is played with a four-sided die (it's a long rectangle, instead of a perfectly square cube).  The die tells you which piece you have to move. ---  --- The game is somewhat easier to learn than chess, but easily as much fun.  The game can and should be used by teachers and parents to introduce their children to the history and culture of India.  The rulebook includes lots of interesting information about India as well as about the history of the game.   ---  --- The game comes in a convenient Bookshelf Edition, where the game is kept in a beautiful book-shaped box that looks great on any bookshelf or coffee table
This was just a boring movie...can't understand the other --- review's saying it's good. Wouldn't reccomend it
This watch has a great look and much potential 'under the hood', but I am having to return mine because of a defective altimeter - it gives readings of up to 1000ft difference in altitude over the course of a few days in the same location during the same kind of weather.  ---  --- I was also disappointed to find that the alarm was barely audible - certainly not loud enough to get my attention if it is under my sleeve - and the metal finish of the watch and band is extremely scratch-prone. I cannot recommend this watch for the price it sells for, even if the altimeter worked correctly.
I purchased this program with the intention of entering a bunch of typewritten pages into my computer.  The document that this program produced from newly typed material was so full of errors that I simply had to re-type.  It would have taken longer to correct than to re-type.  When I talked to Textbridge about these problems all they would tell me is that the program was not meant for such use and that I should buy one of their other programs which had good optical character recognition capabilities.  In other words, they know the product is not any good and they are not willing to stand behind it.  The program is useless for optical character recognition work or anything else
The Pros are this product has alot of functionality for the price. The odometer and heart rate functions were very accurate. The set-up and operations get easier with use (first few times you will need to refer to the manual). The manual is well written and thorough. The cons are the altimeter which is far from accurate
While the suit fits and looks great, my wife had a problem with the fact that the manufacturer placed a label on the outside of the suit.  It's really the placement that bothered her.  There is a black tag sewn into the middle of the rear seam, which from a distance, looks like one had an accident in their trunks. ---  --- Thanks, but no thanks.  These shorts are being returned
I ordered this item on December 13, but it's not deilivered yet as of Jan 3. HORRIBLE SHIPPING!!!
I ordered this three times and each time the same piece was broken. The first two times I ordered it through walmart.com because it's cheaper, but they wouldn't replace the part. The third time I ordered it through babyage.com and was able to replace the part, but I'm still waiting on it. This is a beautiful armoire and matches my nursery set, but it's a major pain. I originally ordered it in July and to re-order and send it back three times has taken 5 months. My son is now 3 months old without an armoire or any kind of dresser
You will still need either a good book or a friend to help you figure out how to hold the pen and make the letters.  This is just a kit w/ paper and pens and the pens weren't even that great.  No matter how you write they don't make lines that transition between fat and thin.  Might as well use a regular pen... --- I am kinda dissapointed and will keep looking for better pens.   --- I give it 2 stars for dollar value. 
I have read other books by Alesia Holliday and enjoyed them so I looked forward to reading this book.  Unfortunately, I could not get any farther than the first 25 pages.  I even tried diving in further into the book to see if it got better and I still could not read more than 5 pages without turning away.  The best I can do to pin down why I dislike it so much is to say that it tries too hard.  No character seems to even approach reality.  They are all, including the main character and her love interest, over the top
     Ico was a game that was very different from others. It focused on puzzle solving and had a short but unforgettable story mixed with fantastic visuals and audio. Imagine what Ico would be if action were incorporated into it, you would have something like Shadow of the Colossus, Ico's prequel. SoTC is a colossal achievement on many different levels. ---  --- Presentation: You stand in front of a deceased woman whose identity  is unknown and are told that by defeating 16 colossi that roam the land, you may be able to revive her...but it may come at a price! This sets up the shroud of mystery that surrounds SoTC as you start your journey. You are given nothing but bows & arrows, a sword, and your trusty horse Agro.  ---  --- Graphics: The land is sometimes colorful, but it's supposed to be desolate so you won't see much life here. The real kudos goes to the animation that occurs during the boss bottles. Different motion blur affects really bring the game to a new level of realism. And Agro's animation is also cinema-worthy as well. ---  --- Gameplay: The meat and potatoes of SoTC is the gameplay. Ride on your steed in the direction of the colossus and begin to battle. You have 2 bars, grip strength and health. Grip determines how long you can hold on to things, such as the colossi themselves. The best part of gameplay isn't done with your hands but your mind. Each colossus is a puzzle that must be solved. It can be determining it's weak spot, or even how to get on the thing. The colossus are so varied that each one will keep you guessing as to what to do next. While it will be hard, it will be one of the funnest experiences you've ever had. ---  --- Audio: Some of the same tracks are repeated throughout here, but they never grow old. The music seems to match the mood. When you've just met the colossus you'll hear soft music while you figure out what to do. Then the music will rise as you mount the beast. All the pieces in here sound good and are great pieces. ---  --- Overall: When you've beaten it and picked your jaw off the ground from the surprise ending, it's not over yet. You have time attack mode and hard mode which can be used to collect a few unlockables. While such modes seem trivial to me, I did mention that this was an extremely fun experience, so even I had to go through it again. This is an absolutely no-brainer, get Shadow of the Colossus now
All this new magazine is is a glossy ad for makeup and clothes. I can't even get my subscription delivered and there is no phone number ANYWHERE to contact customer service.  Don't waste your money unless you love Paris Hilton
Of course this is not the best movie in the world, or even the best French movie. But it is entirely life-enhancing, and shows Truffaut's humanity and humane feeling. It's certainly a film to watch if you're feeling low and want to be cheered up. ---  --- It's so clever in the way that Truffaut deals with himself: as actor playing the part of the director in the film, Ferrand, as director, and as, of course, director of the actual film.  ---  --- He gets wonderful performances from Jean-Pierre Leaud (his other self, here and in several previous films including Les Quatre Cents Coups), Nathalie Baye, and most especially the English actress Jacqueline Bissett (with whom he is supposed to have had an affair during the making of the film. ---  --- Truffaut is one of the great letter-writers, up with Byron, Joyce and Virginia Woolf (Google the book), and both his letters and this film show  the virtues of Catholic atheism: he has not a shred of religious belief, but he is an extraordinarily kind and understanding man who yet can be entirely obsessive about film. ---  --- Watch this if you are down, and pick yourself up with Trufo after: a master-work
They are made so well, operate smoothly all the time and fit so many useful features into a small package.  The other review about them just doesn't hold water.  You can open the knife with a few keys attached without a problem.  The keyring has to be on one end or the other,  but it is really not a hindrance
L'Occitane's Lavender Harvest Matte Face Lotion *really works* to mattify oil and makes a nice makeup primer.  ---  --- I don't have oily skin, but tried some samples over a night serum I was using with avocado oil to mattify it, so my face wouldn't be greasy on my pillow.  It left my skin feeling satiny and smooth.  Avocado is one of the heavier, thicker oils and did wonders for my dry skin, but I hated the feel of it, so finding this was a real bonus to fix that problem.   ---  --- Lavender oil also has relaxing aromatherapeutic properties, is a natural antiseptic which helps prevent blemishes, and mosquitoes don't like it, so if you have oily skin and live in a humid climate in the summer, you should try this!  ---  --- Note: I have had good luck shopping with L'Occitane through Amazon, but called first to make sure what I was ordering was in stock on their website.  
    The first shave seemed good; but the second time did me in with the Fusion. Instead of just one nick, I managed around 3 or 4 nicks at once. But looking at the cost of the replacement cartridges put me into a state of price shock.  ---    I got a Merkur Heavy Duty double edge safety razor & the blades are a huge savings. Merkur blades or Feather double edge blades average 50 cents apiece. The Feather blades are extremely sharp! ---    The Gillette Sensor is more practical for me when in a big hurry. A good old fashioned shave using the double edge safety razor, a badger hair shaving brush, & some Proraso shave cream in the tube is alot more enjoyable & relaxing for me!  ---   ---  ---   
The watch arrived in great condition, it is a very stylish and affordable watch, the only thing is that it is a tad too big and my boyfriends had to take some links out.  He has a big wrist so it was a little unusual.  Nice watch though! No regrets
I wasn't sure what to expect when I 1st tried this two-part microdermabrasion & Peel kit.  I use it twice a week, and what a difference it has made on my skin.  The only thing is , I wish they made a bigger bottle of the Peel.  Mariann
A great bargain!  Saved 50% over buying separately.  Good quality.  Very satified
I discovered Moleskine notebooks in London about two months ago and bought my first, a Small Ruled Notebook, about one month ago. It's not taken me long to become a convert to these little gems, since I've now bought my second Moleskine, the small address book. ---  --- The address book wasn't entirely what I was expecting, but that's a good thing. It is almost identical to the small ruled notebook, except for alphabetized tabs along the page edges. Unlike most address books, there are no neat boxes to fill in with names, street addresses, and city/state/ZIP; no separate spaces for home, work, and cell numbers. There are only ... lines. ---  --- What this means, of course, is that you can record whatever information you choose to, however you choose to. A person can be tucked into one line, or have an entire page for herself. Moleskine makes a big deal about its notebooks being tools for the self-expression of the people who use them, and I was very pleasantly surprised to see that this philosophy extends even into the usually-mundane world of the address book. I didn't expect to have such a positive reaction to this product, but that's what happened
I was (and still am) a huge fan of "Mr. Show".  It was the only reason I kept my HBO subscription.  It's hard for me to believe that the same talent that created "Mr. Show" produced this weak offering.  Might be the least funny comedy CD I've ever heard.  Virtually all the material in the album has been done before, and much better, by other comedians.  Most of the bits just lay there and die.  Mr. Cross seems to realize this and tries to make up for it by saying f*ck a lot.  Sorry, it just doesn't work.   ---  --- Don't waste you money on this one.  Get the "Mr. Show" DVDs instead and forget this ever existed.   
I ordered mine from here (Amazon Marketplace) a couple weeks ago, and I'm a very happy camper. This is one of the best online purchases I've made in a long, long time! First of all, there are songs I've never heard before, so by owning this compilation, it helps me get to know the band's material, or Siobhan's own solo stuff much better. All the songs are very well-written and catchy. Thanks to my best friend, he drew me toward's SS's music back in the 90's with the "HORMONALLY YOURS" CD. SS's music was always something I pushed to the "back burner" because I didn't know what to make of it. But in the past 2 years, I've focused on the new material from the "Shakespears Sister #3" album...and it blew me away! Siobhan is a true musical genius! ---  --- "I DON'T CARE" seems to be a differnt version. It's much brighter & fresher-sounding than the album version. Wow! --- "HELLO (TURN YOUR RADIO ON) is my favorite "SS" song of all time & also appears to be a different version. Just hearing the first notes from it, my eyes got all teary. It's just the way I am, regarding this song. The Clock ticking at the end reminds me of a heartbeat or something. Dark songs like this draw me near. LOL The compilation is missing one song "BITTER PILL". I wanted & hoped for this song to be released on the CD, but unfortunately it didn't make it. Awwww! ---  --- The liner notes booklet is packed with all lyrics, cool photos and a fine page of background regarding the recordings of their albums. Siobhan is one cool gal! I love the front & back artwork, for it is both amusing, colorful & dramatic. I'm a sucker for dramatic stuff like this. Hopefully, Siobhan will continue recording lots of new material, using the "Shakespears Sister" title. I despise the crap we hear on the radio nowadays. Hopefully now that SF has released this package, the music will get more airplay. I like the nostalgic aspect of music from a decade ago, because it reminds us of how the music industry used to be non-commercial and fun. Yes...it's too bad that Siobhan and Marcella broke up, because their 2 uniquely different voices complimented one another. There hasn't been a duo like them since! ---  --- My Thoughts on the DVD... --- I love it! The first & only video clip I've ever seen from "SS" is "STAY". Totaly blew me away since the first time I saw it. I've always loved seeing Siobhan as "Death", in her starry crown & black "Glitzy" outfit. She makes the perfect female version of "Death". I could never understand the video until now, because I never had the chance to see the entire thing on TV. The other videos are equally great and draw me closer each time. --- I appreciate the "Chaptered" Menu for the videos. At least I know what's from where. The DVD was put together very well, and is packed with great stuff. ---  --- Fortunately, my DVD player on the Computer and the TV can play this All-Region PAL DVD. I haven't experienced any difficulties (skipping tracks or anything). It all plays fine. Actually, when i purchased this Item online, the item description said "NTSC Format (USA & CANADA)...so that's why I bought it. It may not apply to everyone's purchase, though. ---  --- DISC ONE (CD): --- 01- You're History --- 02- Heroine --- 03- Break My Heart (You Really) --- 04- Dirty Mind --- 05- Waiting --- 06- Goodbye Cruel World --- 07- Stay --- 08- I Don't Care --- 09- Hello (Turn Your Radio On) --- 10- I Can Drive --- 11- Excuse Me John --- 12- Can U Wait That Long? --- 13- Do I Scare You? --- 14- White Rabbit --- 15- Was It Something I Said? ---  --- DISC TWO (DVD): --- 01- Break My Heart (You Really) --- 02- Heroine --- 03- Run Silent, Run Deep --- 04- You're History --- 05- Dirty Mind (Remix) --- 06- The Russian Film (Featuring Dirty Mind & Heroine Live in Leningrad 1988) --- 07- Goodbye Cruel World --- 08- Stay --- 09- I Don't Care --- 10- Catwoman (Live) --- 11- My 16th Apology (Edit) --- 12- Hello (Turn Your Radio On) --- 13- I Can Drive ---  --- Additional Features/Info: --- - Biography (Same as on 1st page of Linernotes booklet) --- - Photo Gallery With Audio (Music) --- - Credits (for Videos) --- - CD Total Playing Time (62:03) ---  --- If you're an "SS" fan, this item is a MUST HAVE! Regardless the price, it's definitely worth owning! Thank You, Amazon, for making this item available through your Marketplace
The documentary showed some highlights of some excellent flying by various pilots.  However it did not show the abilities of different jets and pilots from different NATO countries.  The actual excercise is much longer and the documentary could have covered more ---  --- The presentation both the picture and sound are top notch.  We found out that not every DVD system can read the IMAX presentation
This is the best frosting I have ever had, and I don't have food allergies. I used it on the gluten free Cherrybrook cupcakes and my son's teacher pulled me aside to tell me how wonderful they were. She also send people to me for the "recipe". I love all the Cherrybrook products, but this is my favorite
I bought this chair because it got such good reviews and looks great. I was so sick of seeing fish, butterflies and primary colors all over our house - the neutral tones were a sight for sore eyes!  ---  --- But I've been so disappointed in this chair's function. With all the nooks and crannies in the buckles and straps, it's impossible to keep clean. The straps and parts of the vinyl seat became so caked with food that I threw them into the washing machine - even though the tags says not to. ---  --- The worst part of the seat is the tray. It's ridiculously wide -- too big for my dishwasher AND my kitchen sink! (And both are full sized.) The way my toddler smears food on the tray, there's no way I could just wipe it with a rag and be done with it. Washing it turns into an exercise in hosing down my countertops with the sink sprayer. Oh well, at least they get clean too... ---  --- Also, I agree with other reviewers that it's really difficult to slide the tray into place. I wind up shaking it around and my poor toddler looks at me like I'm torturing him.  ---  --- On the bright side, the recline feature is wonderful for infants and babies who are just getting the hang of sitting up. Overall, if I had it to do over again I'd pick a simple Fisher Price..
I think Ms Hewitt misses the mark, yes for an actress turned singer she's ok and its more her acting clout that has landed her this record deal and not her talent as a singer... Would someone off the street with the same looks and musical level get a record deal? I think not... Same goes for the other Latin Jennifer..
I have been a reader of BusinessWeek for over 10 years.  I have noticed that it has had a significant change in focus over the last year.  While there are more articles on "Personal Business", the hard-core articles have gone the way of Newsweek, and U.S. News and World reports.  The nature of the articles are lightweight and do not reflect issues important to decision makers today. ---  --- Like many others, I have noticed a political slant or agenda over the last year.  Specifically, their commentaries and economic analysis trend to the left.  Bob Kuttner is co-editor of the American Prospect and contributor to the Boston Globe.  Every one of his articles begins with the premise that the President's policies are bad and then is followed by a tortuous rational for that thesis, to include discussion of the days of gold backed currency. ---  --- Andrea D'Andrea Tyson is better, but as a former Clinton advisor, is not objective in her analysis.  Alternative economic opinions are far and few between and what opinions they do tout, does not agree with the numbers stated in their own Figures of the Week. ---  --- While BW has the potential for great reporting based on their resources, they have let their editorial priorities get in the way of serious business reporting.  For serious Business readers and students, I recommend going to alternative sources. ---  --- And yes, I will let my subscription lapse this year.
I've only had this software for a few months and already know half of the tech support population of Bangalore, India. One problem with this software is that it has an auto update function that results in "Patch Engine Error," which I've solved through versions 2, 3 and 4. Another problem is with Quicken's servers, resulting in CC-501, CC-502 and CC-899 errors. Translation: Quicken's servers are unable to reliably update your bank account information. Today, in the time it took Pandeep to respond to one of my online chat questions, I was able to migrate a dozen accounts to MSN's free online version of Money, which updated all of my bank accounts easily. Conclusion: Save your receipt for their 60-day refund
I have been in the housekeeping business for six years. I ran out of my stainless cleaner today and used my clients. It is the best I have seen there is absolutely no effort to apply this product and the results are fantastic. Two thumbs up for sprayway stainless steel polish. You have my business from now on
After going back and forth between Oil of Olay and Neutrogena I settled on this product mostly because of the price (plus no one complained about the granules getting into their eyes.) I'm happy with the results- my skin is softer and appears to have taken on more clarity. The orange smell is lovely and it only takes two minutes (I do it in the shower.) Of course, it's not microdermabrasian, but it is a great exfolliater for your skin
I'm not a fan of Stephen King film adaptations.  The only one I like is Carrie bec it was directed by Brian DePalma and featured terrific performances by Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie.  Cujo is boring and not all that suspenseful.  I couldn't wait for it to end.  Not worth purchasing.  Okay as a rental
Am I The only ones who actually liked nelly's first album, I Thought it had charm, style, grandier to me and kind of scale and kind of importance, you thought it mean something, but this is just a lame gimmick from the start, I Mean there are some moments and some good songs (including the sexy and very funny music video hot in herre with cedric the entertainer), but the rest are just horrible, there is nothing else about this album that I Can engage with nor cared about and who cares? ---  --- Country Grammer was funny and good, this one's an utter disaster. ---  ---  --- One of the worst albums of the decade.
All the above comments are SO TRUE! I can't believe the prices on Amazon. I too have been running back and forth to Walmart, Kohls, KB Toys trying to get the whole collection. I Am also missing Chick.. But, I won't resort to these tactics. The normal selling price is $3.99 - these sellers should be ashamed!!!
Samsung A670 is a lame phone. Also, the battery life is not good. It didn't have many features so its just a waste of your money. The Ringtone Volume was too low. I would suggest Samsung improved this phone. I am not sure if i ever want another Samusung again. I have all these samsung accessories and they are in no use they just sitting in the box colleting dust.
I LOVE THIS PERFUME. IT HAS BEEN MY SIGNATURE EVERYDAY SCENT FOR SEVERAL YEARS NOW. ALOT OF PEOPLE ASK WHAT YOU ARE WEARING BECAUSE IT SMELLS SO GOOD... AND GUYS LOVE IT TOO
On the DVD --- First Band on the Moon --- Been It - US promo video --- Interactive picture gallery ---  --- Synopsis --- Swedish indie pop combo the Cardigans deliver a stellar performance for their British fans in this performance video. The Cardigans: Live in London was recorded during a concert at the Shepherds Bush Empire in late 1996, as the group were touring in support of their breakthrough album, First Band on the Moon. The 16-song set includes "Lovefool," "Rise and Shine," "Your New Cuckoo," "Nasty Sunny Beam," "Never Recover," and more
I use fountain pens everyday, so I know what I am talking about: This is a great fountain pen for everyday writing -- one that you will not care gets lost or damaged due to its very low price (unlike the average (non limited edition) fountain pens, which can cost over $100 -- and sometimes much more). The Pilot Varsity pen lays down a great fine-to-medium line of ink, and the nib (IE: the writing tip) does not dry out too fast when left uncapped -- and the pen seems to write forever with its large internal ink reservoir. Fantastic buy; and with no muss-'n-fuss of having to refill the pen either!
This was part of the Marvel Action Hour along with Iron Man. At first, the animation and dialogue was pretty bad and they had annoying supporting characters, but the series remain true to the comics. The story lines they took from the comics were done very well, like episodes involving the Silver Surfer
Overall I was pleased with ease of installation. This was an upgrade from Office 2003. I backed up all files before upgrade, and always do this, but it was not necessary for this upgrade. My overall disappointment is Outlook's inability or difficulty to use other mail servers (yahoo, gmail, etc.). The shift appears to favor msn products only (hotmail and msn). No wonder Thunderbird is slowly becoming a favored email application
I love this product. It just tastes great especially with milk.
if ya trade toon worldu can use toons as regular monsters and the it wont make yacange the other guy plays toon world it jes works for if u play itand it plays on on the opone
I think Splenda is great, but I grew up with artificial sweeteners and a true test to how great this product is, is to let a sugar addict try it.  My husband happens to be one, and he cannot tell the difference between Splenda and sugar in his tea! As with other artificial sweeteners, you get an unpleasant after taste--with the Splenda there is none! You can use this to cook with too! It's a wonderful low fat alternative to sugar. 
This movie lacked the luster I expect from Robert Duvall. It was an endless journey into boredom, at least for me
When one trips the safety key, one has to power the treadmill off then on to get the treadmill going again. This action looses all the time and distance information. The Keys Fitness, who manufactures Ironman and a bunch of others, help line confirmed that this is normal for their products. I see this as a safety problem because many people will bypass the safety key by not clipping it on their body
These cookies are so addictive and there is no lack of fudge on them which that is a plus. Other brand of their "swiss fudge cookies" is not as perfect as they believe it is. The outside of the cookie does not blend well with the little bit of fudge they put on it.  Keep making this wonderful cookie and I hope the stores will stock them again
The watch arrived promptly and was exactly what I expected -- a very nice "everyday" watch for a good price
I really wanted to like this product after reading all their hype about how quick and easy it is. Not. The motor in it heats up quickly and the thing stops working. You wait about 20 minutes for it to cool down and it will start up again. But by the time you are  getting results in one area of your foot, the thing heats up and stops working again. I went through four intervals of effective operation, heat build-up causing it to quit, waiting a long time for it cool off before starting up again. Finally I decided it isn't worth the time and aggravation, even though it produced good results during the intermittent periods when it worked. One more thing -- when I gave up and decided to return it, I took my Duracell batteries out and they were blazingly hot. I worry that it might be possible for the batteries to explode from the hot-running motor. I've never seen batteries get scalding hot like this. --- UPDATE: Found Something Much Better --- After returninng the Artemis, I tried the Medicool PediSenso professional pedicure appliance. This one costs 5 times the price of the Artemis but is SOOOO much better it is well worth it. The Medicool is plug-in electric and has much more power than the battery operated Artemis. It has variable speeds, 5 different sapphire filing attachments, and enough power to operate as long as you need. The sapphire files are different shapes and sizes and should last a lifetime, whereas the Artemis requires repeated purchases of its disposable filing heads and batteries. So over time the costs of owning the Artemis will add up -- if the overly hot motor does not burn out. If you have serious callouses and corns, like I do, the Medicool PediSenso will do a very serious, rewarding job. I'm so glad I found it and I am grateful for the relief it provides
I love the actually pendent the time it got there was great. But I really didn't like how they show the pendent on a chain because I bought it for the whole package (chain included). So when I got it I was SHOCKED that it didn't included it. So buyers beware this supplier doesn't give you the actually chain which can cost you up to and extra $15-$30 even thou they adversities it in their ad.
I bought this because as a kid my grandparents had one that I would play with constantly everytime I visited, and at the age of 7 was certain I could solve it.  I never did, and eventually it broke, and it wasn't until I was sitting at my work waiting for my computer to do something, that I thought I needed something to do while I waited for my computer to unfreeze, or for the network to come back online.  So I bought a rubiks cube, figured that it was a good portable puzzle thats easy to store, and is only one piece.  It came with a display stand, so I keep it displayed next to my monitor, and have co-workers come by and scramble it hoping that I won't be able to put it back, but I always have.  Like I said its a puzzle, but not with alot of pieces, and its portable, so if your taking the bus home, you can kill time with it, then put it back in your briefcase, or backpack.  I love it and haven't gotten sick of it yet
If you are looking for codes like Game Shark had, this is not for you.  Not only do you HAVE to have a computer, If anything happens to the disk, you are screwed.  You won't be able reinstall windows, or install it on a new computer.  Some games do offer rewards like unlimited health for %100 completion.  So if those are they games you plan on using,  this is the best thing out there
I bought these for use on my ipod earbuds.  I had an old pair (they were green) that worked great, but I lost one.  Within minutes of putting them on the earbuds, they split open - all three pairs!  If you're planning on using these for your ipod headphones, look into the older colored ones - I believe they're a different material and less prone to cracking
OK so pretzels are supposed to be salty, but these are a tad too salty.  They also have a burnt flavor.  You could say this is a distinctive smokey flavor, but 12 bags ahead of you with the prospects of an unsatisfied pallett is a mighty tall order.  On the other hand the subtle sweet flavors are good.  This is not your ordinary pretzel try them in safety first (instead of buying 12 bags).  Also note grocery items cannot be returned to Amazon
I bought this great piece of crap about a year ago.  When I first used it, I followed the directions as indicated on the box.  Worked fair the first time, I mean I could have just used my dads power washer but no, I am a pioneer and want to try new things.  So then I used it about 6 months later to detail a neighbors car and it left SCUM EVERYWHERE!  This wasn't your ordinary scum, this stuff was hard to get off the car.  I spent a solid day scrubing the car to get this SCUM off the car.  So I swore I wouldn't use it after all that happend.  So today I decided to wash my car because I'm moving to Arizona in a day.  I used the power washer with a new bottle of Mr. Clean soap. I mean hey...what would go wrong....MORE OF THAT SCUM, so here I am now spending my day rubbing the scum off at least the windows instead of packing up the car...anyway you all know my feelings on this product.  Mr. Clean makes quality products but screwed up somewhere with this one
I used to like Rob Zombie, up until Hellbilly Delux.  Everything after that is garbage.  This album is no exception.  Every song sounds the same and is very predictable.  The lyrics are nonsensical, Educated Horses?  He says that phrase in like 3 or 4 songs on this CD, I think he is running out of material and throwing crappy CD's together to scrap in some extra money.  He needs to quit before everyone forgets he used to be talented.  I don't recommend this CD to anyone except the die-hard stalker-type fans that will buy all of his CD's/merchandise regardless.  1 star, I went through this CD in less than 10 minutes, very disappointed, and will never put it back into a CD-player again
I've been using this scrub for a while - it greatly improved the quality of the shave that I get.  I get a lot less irritation. --- I've also used a similar product from Lancome (more expensive) and actually prefer Nivea better
Generations of hate come together in this book.  Pete Braga killed Franklin McMichael dead in a claim of self-defense in the summer of 1952.  The next generation carried on the tradition when Gabriel McMichael supposedly beat Pete's son, Victor, so severely that he suffered permanent brain damage, rendering him with the IQ of a ten-year old.  The third generation was naïve to all this hatred when Thomas McMichael fell in love with Pete's granddaughter Patricia.  The love of his life was driven away at a young age when Grandfather Pete refused to permit their love to blossom.  While the McMichael family existed in near poverety, the Braga family thrived in power and money. ---  --- So now Thomas has a problem.  The root of all his family's hatred, Pete Braga, has been found dead.  He was murdered by someone at his home.  Thomas has been assigned the case to find out who wanted the old man dead.  Given his many enemies, the list of suspects is long.  It doesn't help that the first suspect, Sally Rainwater...Pete's personal nurse, becomes the object of Thomas' heart as the investigation unravels.  ---  --- The story twists and turns through many leads and many unexpected plot points as Thomas McMichael is determined, despite his family's hatred of Pete, to find out who is behind the killing and why.  Author T. Jefferson Parker does an excellent job in keeping the reader involved and interested in the story with his enthralling style.   ---  --- Frederick A. Babb
I'm sure it's a good product for beginners, but I already had an older version of Quickbooks (from 1995) and the only way I could export/import the old data into a newer version of Quickbooks was with QB Pro.  Simple Start doesn't allow you to import data from older versions
This record is a fine example of earnest juju music.  Other artits have tricked it up some with synths and keyboards.  Chief Commander Obe has always managed to offer more traditional representation of juju as it evolved from highlife.  Keep in mind, this means amazing percussion work, intertwining guitar lines, loving vocals and long well developed instrumentals.  If you're interested, you should buy it.  It will make you happy, no matter how you were feeling, and what you're doing
I like the concept of an elevated design.  They should make the sides breathable.  I have had my son sleeping on this since he came home.  This has been 6 weeks so far.  He twitches and moves his legs and arms, and such.  Typical baby stuff.  He ends up slidding down in between the wedges.  I tried putting a rolled up towell at his feet to keep him up.  You would be surprised how tight he pulls his legs in.  He slides no matter what.  When I put the towell to high his head slid off the edge.  Good Idea needs work
I couldn't read past the second chapter.  Roberts is just perpetuating the same old stereotypes about Muslims.  It really steamed me that she used a verse of the Quran out of context for the title page of "The Bitter".  "Your wives are your fields, so go to your fields as you like" isn't meant as a justification of sexual abuse and has never been interpreted as so by real scholars of the Quran.  I'm not going to finish this book, because I'd rather not be reminded of how much I am viewed as some sort of exotic, oppressed "other" type of woman, thanks. --- 
I like the way the program goes through the tax forms as if you are interviewing with a tax preparer. However, I think it needs to do a better job of explaining why a tax form cannot be emailed and how to address that issue
We bought this stroller today in Honolulu at The Bike Factory. Our son is 18 months old, 48 pounds and 40 inches tall (Yes, we know we got a linebacker on our hands) so we had to find something that might last him for the next year or so.  We love that the max weight is 70 pounds, but wonder if the harness system will grow with him being that we have already let out all the slack that is there, I think??!!.  I am going to read the instructions again to see if I might have missed something.  But other than that, the stroller is very sturdy, well-made, and light weight.  It handles like a dream and I wouldn't be afraid to take it to the mall shopping because it is not any wider or more cumbersome than our old Graco.  It folds up to a nice tiny package and fits perfectly in the back our Explorer, where the Graco did not.  I can't wait to take it running down along the beach in the morning.  Oh, and our son loves it too by the way... he watched Elmo in the living room and wouldn't get out until we bribed him with a bath, so it must be pretty comfortable.  Definitely worth every dime, we love it.  I can't say enough good things about BOB either, they are very helpful and their website is pretty informative too, [...
I got this because it was a simple design but still looked good without costing too much.  My only complaint is that my wrists are super small and I had to get links removed, but that was no big deal.  I only wear it when I need to dress up, so it's still in good shape. 
When I received the doll I turned it on and she made about 4 or 5 facial expressions before she said a word. She is not operating properly and since I ordered the doll a month and a half beofre my daughter's birthday, I was unable to return or exchange. I was told to contact the manufacture. I guess the doll was mishandled before it reached me...Be careful
This is the most wonderful and handy kit I have ever had. Everything about it was perfectly made from the iteams inside to the case, it is just wonderful!!!!
I love this scent - it's so fresh yet so distinctive.  Light enough to wear to a ballet or other event where you're in close qurters with others, but distinct enough that people notice it.  Every time I wear it I get compliments on how great I smell. 
I thought I was getting a terrific deal on 6 ink tanks, they look exactly the same as those that came with the printer and those that are packaged individually.  But when I later bought a one-off replacement -- not "custom" -- tank I noticed the ink level bar on the printer LCD was not only full but also longer than the other bars!  If the "custom" tanks hold only about half the ink, this isn't the bargin it appears
the good ---  --- -it has fairly good graphics ---  --- -the franchise is very real and you can play it up to 30 seasons.  ---  --- -it has a bunch of new features that madden 05 didn't like, the truck stick and nfl superstar ---  --- the bad ---  --- -once you've played this for awhile you'll realize that john madden and al micheals say the same thing every game. it get old.  ---  --- -when you look into the crowd in a game, the graphics suck. it looks like a big blob of colors ---  ---  overall it is a really fun game. i hope madden 07 will be better though. --- 
AFTER 81 YEARS, I HAVE DECIDED TO GIVE UP ON THE GREAT DRAMATIC MOVIES THAT PRESENT THE WORLD IN ALL ITS MASSIVE TURMOIL.  I GET ALL THAT FROM NEWSPAPERS, PERIODICALS, RADIO, TELEVISIOPN AND NOW, EVEN THE INERNET.  I WANT TO WATCH MOVIES THAT I CALL "FEEL GOOD" MOVIES. THESE MOVIES CEMNTER ON A SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE WITH A FEW INSIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS AND THEN, OVER THE COURSE OF AN HOUR OR SO, WORKOUT THE KINKS OF THIER LIVES AND LIVE HAPPILY EVER AFTER.  THESE MOVIES CAN BE FULL OF PATHOS OR BATHOS OR EVEN SLAP STICK COMDEDY, BUT THEY NEVER PRESENT YOU WITH ANY PROBLEM GREATER THAN HOW TO GET YOUR MOTHER-IN-LAW TO BABYSIT THE KIDS BUT NOT MOVE IN WITH YOU...UNLESS YOU WANT HER TO.  COLD COMFORT FARM MEETS MY CRITERIA TO BE CLASSIFID AS A "FEEL GOOD" MOVIE. 
This fantastic re-imagining of the Avengers is best consumed in this form. Yes there are too many pop culture references, yes the hulk is a little goofy and the Ultimate Nick Fury has virtually nothing in common with his regular universe counterpart but I think once your done with this gigantic, thirteen issue epic powerhouse you wont have much left to complain about. This story arc takes the Alternate Universe Avengers from their creation to their first major victory, ill let someone else spoil it for you but its good. The second volume is juuuust about complete as of november 2006 and is pretty amazing as well. This is the best that the Ultimate universe has to offer, is one of the few titles exploring fairly original ideas and has not been reworked specifically to appeal to teenagers, no inline skates, teen angst, or first love in this one.  ---  --- Millar and Hitch are a great creative team but their ability to make deadlines is positively absurd. These thirteen issues took the better part of three years to be released and I read every one of those issues as it was released on the news stand. My wife got her MSW in the time it took the skrull war to unfold, it sucked and the new series isnt much better. Thankfully it has only one issue to go, hopefully well get it before theres a new president in the whitehouse. Removed from the delays the series is a pretty impressive achievement, the art is top notch and the story is positively crackin! Yes it's "just" a super hero comic but its one of the best, so if you like the medium and are lucky enough not to have read it yet do yourself a favor and check it out, and keep an eye out for the second series hardcover
This is a great product, easy to program and use.. easy to read digital display and very accurate
Ive gotten used to the disposable kodaks i got from the checkout isle at walmart. The problem with those, though, is that they run out of pictures pretty quick. The last straw was when we ran out of film at the family reunion just as cousin billy was about to show us how to catch a lizard with a rubber band and a twinky. At that point I knew I needed an upgrade. ---  --- I ordered the Canon EOS-1Ds Mark II the next day, for [...] The feature that first caught my attention was the powerful zoom. Now when I take a family picture, I like to step back about a mile or two, then zoom in and snap that high-resolution masterpeice. My wife always complains that i zoom too close into the big pores on her nose, to which i respond by suggesting she use clean and clear pore cleansing strips (watch for her upcoming review of those soon).  ---  --- Another useful feature of this camera is the continuous shooting mode. This is where the camera automatically takes pictures in rapid succession, about 5 per second. The other day I set the camera on the dresser, turned on the macarena, and got wild. I then took the individual pictures and strung them together into an animated flipbook. Now watching myself do the macarena is a mere flip of the book away. Man i can dance. ---  --- To summarize, you will have a lot of fun with this cam like i did. Definitely worth the [...] ! But remember, there is a [...] that comes with it; so make sure you fill in the item number clearly on the [...] card, and make sure you stay within the space alloted on the form otherwise the [...] wont go through
The color of the actually received ear rings was quite light. A darker amethyst color would have been much better and the picture on the computer screen was really deceptive, since that showed a much darker colored amethyst. I won't buy jewelry from Amazon again when it comes to a colored stone. HSN depicts their jewelry much better on the screen and provides better stone quality products
Looked at them all and then bought this software... it can do a lot of things so, yes, it might take a bit to learn and get fast with.  ---  --- There is a reason it has been voted best for several years now. It does a good job if you remember the very old computer saying, --- "Garbage IN...Garbage OUT" 8-)   ---  --- My wife loves the video tutorials that she can pop-up anytime she needs to without stopping the software and what she's working on. ---  --- Anything this complete, is worth the learning curve
We bought this diaper pail when our newest baby arrived.  We had previously used a Diaper Genie, that we no longer had - it worked fine, but was expensive.  We decided to buy the Diaper Dekor because of the Odor Free Guarantee.  Don't buy it.  The guarantee or the pail! --- It stinks up the whole house with just one or two diapers in it.  We have kept it in the garage, and also outside.  Not convenient.  Refills are expensive.  And worse yet - my one year old can get DIRTY DIAPERS out of it through the top - or get the bag through the door in the front!!! Who designed this thing???
I bought these shoes to do aerobics in. They look good and are comfortable, but only to walk in. There is zero arch support and when I walk in them I feel as if my feet are flat on the ground. There is zero shock absorption and no cushion for doing aerobics. My old shoes that are 8 months old has triple the cusion of these new ones, but I can't use the old ones. The gym on the base here do not allow dirty shoes. They are 8 months dirty full of sand and dirt. I am really let down over this as it took me three weeks to have them delivered to my remote location. Now I have to look again
While this movie was filmed in the Coos Bay, Oregon area I got to be an extra in it. I had my doubts about it at the time. But now that I have seen it, I say it is well worth watching if you like humor and a feel good  movie. Some profanity and mild nudity. Not for the real youngins. BTW, I am  the guy in the blue baseball cap at the bar, the girl I was flirting with  is my sister
I really like the JAVOSkin for my Treo -- it's well made and has openings so all the features of the treo are usable.  The material is soft to the touch but strong on protection.  I don't like the lanyard they send with the product, it's about 24" long and reminds me of shoelaces.  I prefer a smaller, more delicate lanyard that would go around my wrist
I had a palm 650 for two years. It had a few issues, but generaly speaking it worked well. Unfortunately one of my big concerns was the phone size.  When I first Bought it, I did not think it woud be a big deal. But after having it for a while, it felt like I was carring a brick in my packet (If you are an smart phone user, then you know what I am talking about.) I wanted to switch phones but all smart phones in the market had the same disadvantage of being good but huge on size. I was debating between a Q and a Bjack when I discovered the pearl. At first I thought it would not have the same capabilities of a palm, Q, or bjack; but I had it for 3 months now and to tell the truth,there is so many advantages on this phone I do not miss my palm at all. The pearl not only does not have the flaws that palm does, but also has the same (or more) capabilities and browsing speed. The trackball works way better than a touchscreen. So far I am very happy with my purchase that I am glad I got the pearl and not the Q or Bjack. The best part is that I finally feel that I am carring a phone and not a brick in my packet. Not sure about it? then do not believe me; simply check the reviews of all smarth phones online. You will be surprised to find that the pearl gets usually Higher grades than most other smart phones
I have not had any problems with this phone.I dont use it for long periods at a time ...only in the car and for text.Adding minutes is easy and i REALLY GET MY MONEYS WORTH WITH THE ROLLOVER.I averaged it at less than 10 bucks a month with 600 minutes to spare...so its great for me.I got better ringtones online and still waiting to see about wallpaper.Overall,I would recommend this phone if you dont need more than 100 minutes per week
I've previously had subscription cell phone services with a variety of providers, but found I rarely used the number of minutes I was paying for.  A prepaid phone service seemed like the way to go, and STI Mobile sounded like a good alternative because the price was competitive and minutes don't expire.  I signed up and shortly after received my Samsung phone.  It arrived, however, defective - the port for recharging the phone was damaged.  Per the STI Mobile web site, I contacted them within 14 days to arrange for a replacement phone.  This resulted in a number of email exchanges with customer service.  In the first one, the rep told me that I was mistaken, and must have been sent the wrong charger.  No offer was made to replace the charger, strangely, which was included as part of the package deal.  After additional emails where I reassured her that I did in fact have the right charger (I took the phone in to a local merchant, who showed me the charger I was shipped worked with an identical model phone - it was the port on the shipped phone that was defective).  At this point, the rep apologized and told me I would have to contact Samsung for a replacement phone!  This entire process took several weeks. ---  --- In short, I guess you get what you pay for.  If I had been shipped a working phone STI Mobile probably would have met my needs, but I was turned off by the poor customer service and have since found another prepaid phone provider
I feel Home Designer Suite 6 is a good value for the price. It obviously is not a full blown pro program, which I think many people expect, however it is a great tool for an ordinary person to do preliminary plans for new construction or remodeling. Those plans can then be provided to a architect or builder as a foundation for final planning. It is quite easy to learn the basics by merely following the tutorials in the manual, or on the provided CD
I received an email from amazon asking me to review this item I had purchased.  This item never arrived from Macy's.  I emailed them and they said they would ship it immediately and I would have it in ten business days.  3 weeks later I still didnt have the item.  I contacted them back and was advised the item is no longer available.  My account was ( reportedly ) credited but poor service on this item
Stylish, comfortable, good sound quality...and utterly useless at noise cancelation. Great for allowing one to conveniently eavesdrop on seat-side passenger conversations while listening to your favorite tunes, and you'll be sure to not miss any important safety instructions on your next flight. Perhaps there's a reason there was no floor demo set out of the box. I suggest you insist on this. Sure, turning on the noise cancelation sliding button would seem to somewhat reduce ambient noise, but as far as I can tell the only thing it does is slightly amplify the music volume.
First off, as many people have said, the game is wonderful as a movie--less so as a game itself. I am not a habitual player of RPGs for the sake of their gameplay, however--I stray toward puzzle-solving and instant-action games along the lines of the Ecco the Dolphin and Metroid series, respectively--but I appreciate the intricate storytelling the genre allows for. ---  --- Xenosaga really goes overboard for the sake of its story--and there's nothing wrong with that. The game is pretentious, and open about being pretentious. The cast of characters are all, to a greater or lesser degree, mentally ill, from heroes to villains and back again. The story takes a sudden and whiplash-inducing turn in the last third of the game. The morality of decisions made are distinctly Nietzschean--which is to say, often amoral and confused. But--the critical but!--it's a wonderful story often BECAUSE of these facts. ---  --- If you'd like a good story to chew over and talk with your friends about (I'm still talking about it, three years after I was introduced to it!), buy this game. If you want instant action and a transparent storyline--eh, give it a try. It can't hurt anything. But understand--when you're going into it--that this is more of a movie than it is a game; the objective is to entertain, enlighten, and even disturb through the visual medium, not necessarily through the gameplay itself. ---  --- Oh, and, there's plenty of eyecandy for both the ladies and the gentlemen. Always a bonus. 8
IT WORKS LIKE A HOOK FOR CLOTHES OF MY WIFE ;
I got the item quickly, it installed easily, and when it rains it removes water from the windshield - which is what I expected it to do.  No complaints
I was disappointed getting this product because I've read the previous reviews and the majority have written positive feedback on this hair iron.  I actually prefer the cheaper Conair's ceremanic irons w/o the wet on/off feature over this one.  It doesn't clamp down well on my hair (I've got thick frizzy hair).  The results for me aren't that great, it straightens my hair a little but it's still frizzy.  It's lightweight which is nice.  I don't care for the wet hair option because it takes me twice as long to straighten my hair.  I definitely prefer other models over this one. 
This was a great price for this battery with twice the capacity of the standard battery. The only thing I don't like is the lack of a rubber strip on the back of the battery door to keep the phone from sliding around. All in all this was a great deal
This is not only a thrilling story on the life of a group of African Americans but it also captures the reality of the streets of L.A. As you watch the movie you see the life surrounding this group of black friends. You truly become attached to the characters and begin to feel that they cant do anything to escape the struggle they have been in since they were born. Ice Cube the main character plays a gangbanger who is living the life of a criminal, from fights on the corner, to drive by shootings. --- This movie truly captures the struggle millions of African Americans go through. As we watch the kids grow up in the ghetto, to when they are old enough to get out, they still seem to be the same. Their customs dont change, simply because of their surrounding, guns, liquor, poverty, and crime. They have no other option than do join in.  --- When dough boy's(Ice Cube) brother Ricky is offered a scholarship to play college football it looks like a way to get out of the ghetto. The whole family feels as this a way for them to escape it also, so everyone is supporting him. Until a tragedy is brought upon the family. This story truly proves nothings good until finally out of the hood for these boys. 
Gene Watson's music was introduced to me by a friend who played drums for Sonny James, Ernest Tubb, and Dottie West.  I had never heard of him but then when I heard his voice on the CD I knew the songs.  It's amazing to me how a person with such a great voice has never received the attention that he should.  Every song is great but the one which I really like is "The Old Man and His Horn".  This was a song I had never heard.  It also shows the versatility of Gene's song selections.  He has the best voice of any country singer I have ever heard
i've been using ojon for a year or so, and my hair has never been healthier.  i have long, fine, wavy hair which i flat iron about 5 times a week; this product definitely keeps your hair shiny and protected from heat damge and split ends.  hair stylists are always amazed at the great condition my hair is in being that i heat treat it so often, and i get comments all the time from friends, family, and just people i encounter about how shiny and pretty my hair looks.  the smell is distinctive (not offensive in my opinion), but you wash the product out out!  my hair smells like my shampoo/conditioner, so i really don't understand what the other posts about the smell are trying to say.  i definitely reccomend this product and do so often.  
When I saw the pictures, I thought I could fit both kids. They fit, but with little room for two. No room for play.  I will purchase another one. Still a good product, safe and sturdy and easy to clean.
When the publishers of my all-time favorite women's fitness magazine (Muscle & Fitness Hers) decided to stop producing it, I had to find a suitable alternative.  While it's not as "meaty" as Muscle & Fitness Hers, it's a good, inspiring read.  It devotes too much space to fluffy stuff like clothing and makeup (and ug, even a few celebrities), but overall I would recommend it...at least until something better comes along
This book has a lot of information about how protecting wild areas works in WA and and an overview of the protections offered by the United States Government. It then provides the inspiration to get people started through true stories of grassroots projects. While the book doesn't list 1, 2, 3, what needs to be done to start a grassroots movement, that shouldn't be expected, because all people have different motivations, and this book should be used as a tool to help you understand the basics of how these sorts of movements work. A must for anyone who wants to further understand Washington state for all of its great wild places, or anyone for that matter, that is looking for inspiration on why wild areas should be protected. Plus all of the proceeds go to a great cause
As another viewer pointed out this product contains CORN SYRUP not at all organic. In fact the only organic thing in this product is the Fig. For those of us trying to maintain a healthy organic eating lifestyle you MUST read the list of ingredients before assuming the front label is accurate. This goes for all products not at all an attack against Paul Newman products which my family does consume we enjoy their products that are truly organic
My 14 month old son loves the Baby Einstein series.  They've been the only movies to hold his attention.  The sounds and music get his attention, the shapes and colors hold it. ---  --- That said, this movie never got or held his attention.  There are no interesting sounds or music.  The voices are very monotone.  While I understand the intention of this video, if you don't catch the attention of the child, what's the worth in it?  The pictures on the screen do not corrolate well with what is being said.  I also believe that there is value in learning not only foreign languages, but foreign cultures.  If I knew what was being said when nursery rhymes or poems are recited, I could repeat them in english as an additional learning tool.  All around, this move was disappointing
This magazine is fun and upbeat. The pictures are bright and colorful but more importantly they add to the text. If the text is about cooking a steak for example the pictures will be clear and easy to understand and will fully document what the text is saying. There are many many recipes. One section actually has a pull out shopping list and menus for a week. A great magazine. Well worth the money.
The one I bought is green and black - looks good in the water. I first look this kayak (dingy really) out into the Gulf of Mexico. The swells were two two three feet and the harder I paddled the behinder I got. I thought I had made a bad purchase but then I took the dingy into Clearwater Bay with much calmer waters and I'm having the time of my life.  ---  --- Paddling is slow going - 2 to 3 miles per hour at most but I've gone a couple of miles and back all along the bay. I bought a Coleman pump that runs on 4D batteries and I can inflate and deflate it five times before I need to change batteries. This kayak is the best $70 I've ever spent. Great exercise too
This is the first RC (radio control) aircraft I have ever flown, although I have raced RC cars for quite awhile. It comes fully assembled with a nice manual and even a quick intro DVD to get you in the air quickly.  ---  --- I started out in my living room and it has worked just great. With just a little trimming out the heli is very stable and easy for which to get a feel. I've run it for a few hours now with no incidents and I'm getting pretty good at hovering although I still have a tough time with head-in flight (controls thus reversed). ---  --- The Blade CX RTF makes a great first heli or just a great indoor heli. Probably fine for anyone over 10 years old. I am getting 10-15 minutes of flight time on a battery charge. The only disappointment is that charging a battery takes 60-90 minutes (typical with all LiPo batteries). I'd recommend getting an extra battery or two and maybe even an extra powersupply and charger. Also I have tried the Training Gear add-on for the Blade CP/CP Pro -- it fits the CX just fine and allows you to use it later if you move on -- and it helps with damage but makes the Blade CX slightly less stable in hover in my opinion but not terribly so. They're probably worth the trade off at first. ---  --- In a few more hours I think I'll be ready to move up to the Blade CP Pro. Highly recommended for anyone interested in entering RC helicopters or who just wants a heli to fly around the house. ---  --- Two good sites for further info are [...]
These flashlights are made in China.  That is not too surprising nowadays and is in no way an adverse comment on their quality and construction which seem to live up to what we might hope from a traditional American brand such as Smith & Wesson.  I have two of these and I expect them to last me the rest of my life.  (I am 60.) ---   --- A tad expensive (which is why only four stars) but small enough to be convenient, bright enough to be useful and efficient enough to be inexpensive to operate. ---  --- I bought these flashlights for use during blackouts but their convenience has me using them for illumination whenever I am fiddling around with cables behind the TV or under the office desk or inside the computer.  The small size means they are easy to hold in an armpit or in the same hand as another tool. ---  --- I also bought the red-LED version for use in the car so as not to affect night vision
It took me all of 4 hours to read this book.  It was insightful and entertaining.  It was also sad.  I cried so hard at the end of the book that I hiccuped for 3 hours.  I work at a children's home and have passed this book to several of my 'children' who returned the book damp with tears and facing challenges with new resolve.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who has to face ANY TYPE of challenge, whether mental, physical, financial, whatever
I have gone through my latest copy twice of this magazine. The interesting articles and letters make you feel like you are part of a community, not just a crazy cat person. I like the extensive breeder listing in the back, whether or not I ever will get a pure bred cat.
My daughter bought this harmonica with a gift certificate that she had received.  She just loves it.  This is a quality harmonica, with great sound.  We received fast delivery and it was packaged well.  No complaints here
Rien a dire si ce n'est que Too $hort et ses potes ça claque c'est tout
I purchased this as an extra phone so I could access both phone lines on the second floor of my house. Well-built with hold and 3-way conferencing features, sound quality is good and it has selectable ring levels for each line. Powered from the phone line, no external power is used. One drawback: the line indicator doesn't light when the line is being used by other phones in the house.
I watched this movie last evening and I have to say that I have never seen weird, confusing movie since 12 Monkies.  I'm still confused.  --- The plot is pathetic and mindlessly confusing, it's all about lucid dreams and Tom Cruise seeing how many times he can flick his hair in a minute while the cameras on him.  The film is basically all a blur from start to finish, it's a dreadful mix of sci-fi nonsense and obvious fake romance.  Why on earth would someone want to remake a foreign film with this kind of plot anyway.  Don't buy this film on DVD or you'll be wasting your money.  I'm sorry if you've found this review uninformative, but since Vanilla Sky is really about nothing whatsoever it's very hard to go into much detail.
This is a complete waste of money for a number of reasons. ---  --- 1. This hub will not work with any USB powered devices. So forget being able to charge your phone or running an unpowered external disk through this hub. ---  --- 2. Extremely slow USB 1.1. This device is NOT USB 2.0 compliant ---  --- 3. It is clunky ---  --- 4. Does not comke with a power adapte
These pods are very expensive, but the taste is incredible. Please reply to this review if you find better (seems hardly possible)
Hello, ---  --- I recently bought this blood pressure monitor.....it functions all well......BUT it gives incorrect readings.......i mean the readings vary significantly........not once , twice...but many many times......I was and am never sure about the validity of the readings..... --- Purchase this at your own risk.....my recommnedation would be to get a manual blood pressure monitor like the one with the doctors.....atleast u will know that the readings r genuine...and u can ALWAYS find someone who can spare 5 minutes and help u get the readings...... --- Take care and stay healthy......
I don't recall having seen a film where the actors enjoyed more playing their roles.  They seemed to have had a ball
I was rather disappointed in Mr. Peterson's work. He dwells much too long on trying to convince us of "the problem". Nearly the first half of the book is spent on statistic overload!  Even after wading through the  numbers and graphs, I am still skeptical of his conclusions and would  caution readers to do further research.  Certainly the Baby Boomers are an  aging bulge in the population of the US and will create some challenges.   However, the author fails to mention the "echo boom" (baby  boomer's children which are equal in number) and he glosses over the impact  of the huge young immigration population that comes into the country every  year.  Both of these facts will "soften" the impact of the  "Gray Doom" that Mr. Peterson tries to create.  I just don't  anticipate the tremendous problem of which  he tries to make us aware.  But  I did find interesting the apparently huge impact that abortions and birth  control will have on our future. Another disappointment was very little  discussion of aging trends and buying habits. Despite these shortcomings, I  enjoyed parts of the book and it stimulated thinking about the future and  the impact of aging populations
I agree with the previous reviewer. --- I have used this brush for years! --- It was recommended to me by a hairdresser, and I will never use a different brush. ---  --- Unless you have fine, thin, hair,  you will love this brush!!!
Tony Nourmand's "Film posters of the 60's" is a wonderful and  colorful coffee table style book that is a great treat to look through.  There are many of the classic film poster images of the French New wave,  the films of Stanley Kubrick and the classic 007 posters, just to name a  few. Film poster collecting is a great adventure and this book reflects  that enthusiasm. This book was lovingly organized with great detail. A  superb value! Looking forward to future editions
A great outdoor grill.  However you really need gloves to open it and load wood once hot
The dolls and outfits in this set are adorable and the case was a cute idea.  The only problem that kept me from giving this item a high star rating is the case itself.  I wish the case closed more tightly, it closes with a small gap along the sides also the entire case lid keeps coming off easily.  Overall tho, aside from the annoyance of the lid, for the price it was still worth purchasing because as I've said the dolls and outfits are so adorable and a great addition to my 8yr old daughters polly collection.
1 Star is being generous.  I've been an ACT user for almost 20 years.  I think it's time to say good-bye. ---  --- Reasons: ---  --- 1.  2007 version is agonizingly slow.  Effects my whole system.  I added 1 gb of RAM bringing my total to 2gb with no improvement.  Seems like 5 secs to execute ANY command in the program.  Doesn't seem like much bu count it...one one thousand, two one thousand...  It adds up when you use the program all day, every day. ---  --- 2.  Support is atrocious. You get 60 days after purchase and then can't even access their tech moderated forum unless you pay $300 a year. ---  --- 3.  It ought to be broken down.  I use it to manage client information and communication, I don't need all the Opportunity garbage and one can spend more time managing a process than actually doing the darn thing. ---  --- 4.  Support sticks.  In the last couple of years, I've never had a phone call answered in less than 30 minutes...and that includes when I was dumb enough to pay the then $200 a year. ---  --- 5.  Support stinks even when you pay 300 a year. ---  --- 6.  Support is a ripoff.  One support plan.  No by incident option.  300 bucks or nothing. ---  --- 7.  Did I mention that support is the worst?  They seem to do things on the website and then think about what they just did.  Navigating their forums is a nightmare.  I had to click around for 10 minutes this morning to figure out how to post in an unmoderated forum.  (BTW, 4 messages total in the 2007 section in 6 months.  I guess most pay their 300 bucks for the moderated forum.) ---  --- 8.  An example of how time consuming it can be:  It took me a week of phone calls with several reps to get the UPGRADE installation to function.  And I mean it didn't function at all.  It made such a mess that I had to reformat my hard drive to get it to install.  A first in 20+ years of computer use. ---  --- Sage seems to think this program is the only one a user installs on their computer.  Bad attitude. ---  --- SAGE and ACT! are poster children of everything bad about the software industry today. ---  --- Do yourself a favor, if older versions are working for you...stay there.  The enhancements in 2007 are not worth the trouble. ---  --- If you're looking for a contact manager, look elsewhere. --- 
With a cable modem, took about 1 hour and 15 minutes to download Unbox, install the program and download the episode.  It's a great download speed considering the file is 803 mb.  I was able to still use my computer, IE 7.0 and RealPlayer, so the download is not a resource hog.  The menu bar includes a link to shop for more Unbox titles, which I found very convenient.   ---  --- The quality is great, but the video stutters in Unbox.  Maybe because it uses 3 applications when playing video?  I chose to watch the episode on Windows Media Player 11 and I had no problems at all. ---  --- I've bought and watched 3 episodes, all with the same results.  Fast and unobstrusive download, great quality and low price.  Just use WMP, or another player that can handle wma files, to watch.     
I ordered this phone on 3/28/07. It shipped via FEDEX on 3/29/07 to my office with an indicated delivery of 3/2/07. The package sat on the FEDEX truck for three days before they attempted to deliver it at 8pm to an adjacent business and then left it without the package being signed for. This was after I'd already called FEDEX to refuse delivery of the package because it was too late in arriving.  FEDEX's response for it sitting three days on the delivery truck was that the driver was overloaded.  For the $100 difference in price it was less hassle to just go to the local Cingular store.
Arrived with dead batteries in it, factor the price and time of getting three AAA batteries on your own into your decision of whether to buy this product or not
All I needed was to upgrade the hard drive on my Dell laptop, so I got Acronis True Image version 9 for half the price of the current version 10. ---  --- I put the new hard drive (right off the sealed box) into a USB caddy that I got on eBay for $6, plugged it into the USB port, and ran Acronis 9.  Selected the "Clone Drive" wizard, and less than an hour later it was done. ---  --- No need to cross my fingers... the new drive booted right up, and I'm using it now to write this review.  What could be easier
The new burner's work great, good as new! --- Only problem was removing old burners.  The screws that hold the ends in place were rusted in place.  I had to drill them out, and replace the screws. --- But all fine now..much cheaper than buying new grill
I purchased this product 2 years back and it is still working without any problem. I use the batteries mostly for my digital camera and have no complaints so far. Highly recommend this product
Those who hunt elves is worth the buy, you won't regret it.
THIS HAIRSPRAY WAS TOO WET AND TOO STIFF.  IT RUINED MY CLEAN, FRESHLY WASHED HAIR AND MADE MY BLONDE LOCKS STIFF AND DARKER - YUCK!!!! ---  --- I LOVE THE VOLUMINIZING SHAMPOO & CONDITIONER AS WELL AS THE VOLUMINIZING FOAM - BUT WHEN I LIGHTLY SPRAYED THE "FINISHING" HAIR SPRAY- IT RUINED EVERYTHING.  I WILL STICK TO AN AREOSOL HAIRSPRAY INSTREAD OF A PUMP.  SORRY JONATHAN : 
I bought this chair because of the great reviews, I hesitated at spending so much, but figured that all the features would be worth it considering my son would be using it for a couple of years.  --- Pros: --- I like that I can roll it around to the table, or to the sink to clean up after meals. The height adjustment is easy and convenient.  --- The cons: --- Folding it up didn't quite work as I thought it would. It didn't lock into the folding postition...and didn't really save that much space. I would prop it against the wall, and hope that no one knocked it down. We finally stopped folding it up. The toys that connect to the tray were too dangerous for my son, as he would usually hit himself in the face with them when he was younger, by the time he was older, I didn't really need them. The battery operated toy has a funny smell to it whenever it's been running for a while. He did like it...but the buttons were too hard for him to press when he was younger. My son discovered at 7 months how to pull off the extra tray that can go into the dishwasher, so we don't use that. He's 13 months now, and last week discovered how to disconnect the tray itself and fling it off of the high chair. I washed the seat cover per the instructions, and half the time did not use the dryer, even though it said it could go into the dryer, and now the seat is bubling and cracking...I have to place a cloth diaper in the seat to protect my son's legs. If I had not spent $90.00 on the chair I would not be as disappointed...but he's only used it for 7 months.
I am not a photographer, but I enjoy taking good pictures. I never had a digital SLR before; the camera I had before the D50 was a Nikon Coolpix (a compact one). I thought this would have been a good camera for someone who enjoys good pictures without being a pro. I realized that it was even better than what I expected (maybe because I was coming from a Nikon Coolpix). The colors are amazing and the quality of the picture is extremely good. --- The D50 is among the cheapest digital SLR's, and, at the same time, it is a very serious product. I don't think the D50 is much inferior to the Canon Rebel, even if the Canon has 2 more megapixels of resolution. I used both the D50 (which I own) and the Rebel (at my school) and I think the D50 feels much more like a "pro camera" when you hold it in your hands, while the Rebel feels more like a toy. --- The lenses provided in the package are good, but are basic. According to me the 18-55 is better than the 28-80, but I think I should have bought the 55-200 as well: 18 to 200 covers most of the pictures that you can take. Also the 18-135 that Nikon sells with the D80 looks good to me, but they don't make a kit with those lenses for the D50. ---  --- The last thing that really amazes me is the .NEF format (Nikon's RAW format). It is impressive how quickly you can improve a .NEF picture with your computer in just very few clicks of mouse. ---  --- If you want a good camera, and you don't want to spend too much money for it I think this is the best choice
I love Kashi stuff and this bar is no exception.  There have just a great --- taste, not too sweet, no funny aftertaste and very satisfying when --- eaten between meals.  Highly recommended.
My wife hates hot food, but for some reason, loves hot fries.  If her salsa has the tiniest spice, she won't eat it, yet these mouth-burning beasts are her favorite snack.  They are sometimes hard to find - having them by the case helps solve that problem.  The size offered here is the size that you will normally find (around here at least) printed with the 99c price, so you can also figure the price savings, somewhere around, what, 40%?  Wow
Beautiful graphics and nice storyline, but the amount of times the game freezes or you receive an error is just awful! Not to mention, the monsters level up with you so you'll never be at an advantage. You could pretty much beat the game at level 5 
Got the phone and found out that in order to mount it to the wall, I need to purchase a $4.00 part and pay $5.00 shipping and taxes. ---  --- Now all the specs say wall mountable, not wall mountable with an extra purchase! ---  --- Ok, $8-10 isn't going to break me, but somewhere it should state that you need to get an extra bracket in order to mount it on the wall! ---  --- So, since I can't mount it on the wall, I haven't used it yet!  --- Have to wait a week or so for the wall mount bracket to come in...
This printer prints fast but the quality is poor. Consumer reports rates it a best buy but I disagree. Pictures come out very graney and its almost worthless to have a 2 megapixel or higher camera because the quality will not be seen with this printer. I do not recommend this printer to anyone. I bought the Cannon to replace a Hewlett Packard deskjet 932C and it was slow but the picture quality was superior to the Cannon. This purchase was a real dissapointment
That's the best tool. Small and yet powerful! I tested it! --- ResQMe is my safety buddy
I'm very impressed with how non intrusive this software is.  I used Norton for approximately 5 years before I changed to Bit Defender.  I didn't realize how bogged down my system was until I made the change.  The system scan is very quick (approx. 8-10 minutes in comparison to 20-25 minutes from Norton).  I don't even notice when the software is updating.  I'm very pleased with the program thus far and I highly recommend it
I love the smell of Philosophy Pure Grace. The shampoo/shower gel smells just as clean and fresh as the perfume. It's not too drying either
i got the car buddies frog covers for my daughter. it was a birthday present. she absolutly loved them. she is a big frog collecter. her whole dashboard is covered in frogs
We love this seat.  It is great for keeping in the car for those times when you find yourself in a packed restaurant that is out of high chairs.  Or at mother inlaws without a highchair.  Or a family holiday dinner where there is no highchair.  When traveling with a little one or even just at the park or a sporting event.  There are so many uses for this great little seat.  It is extremely light weight and compact, and comes with a carrying bag
I really liked the outside design of the book. A lot of books were "cartoonish" and really was drawn to the look of the book. I wish the book did not have so much random fill-in pages. I had hoped that it would have blanks to fill in for different events/ages of the child. But all in all I am pleased with it. I would most likely buy again
This is great furniture folks.  --- Many times I have thought that Amazon hired people to rave in these reviews but I cannot say enough about how nice this furniture is! --- I bought 4 chairs, the settee, and b/c they don't have a side table in the Bainbridge pattern I bought the Shaw table with the ice pit. --- I have recommended these to everyone, lol, the price has gone up $10 every week for the past 2 weeks.....get em while their hot
I'm not a cosmologist, but Stephen Hawking's Universe was so simply written it is essentially condescending.  The language is akin to the level one would read in a newspaper.  Moreover, the pictures are second rate pre-contact lense Hubble knock-offs (despite being published in 1997), and the book has very little to do with Stephen Hawking.  Sure, he wrote the foreward and did some editing, but it lacks the wit and wonder of a Hawking work.  Naming the book after him and putting his picture on the front is misleading.  I AM a chemist, and despite this, Filkin's descriptions of Chemical discoveries left even me guessing because he was attempting to dumb-down ideas that aren't dumb-downable, and didn't include diagrams which would be helpful for anyone trying to understand the concepts (like neutrino capturing or particle acceleration).  If you want to learn some cosmology, read "A Brief History of Time" or "A Short History of the Universe".  These are simply written but informative works that won't leave you waiting for substance
Let me start out this review by saying that this anime should be a martar for other anime to follow because it is an amazing anime. The plot is basically a cybernetic government agent, Major Motoko Kusanagi, who goes and tries to catch a computer virus called "The Puppet Master". From start to finish this movie is amazing with great animation and storyline. I think almost everybody should be able to see it as long as they are mature enough. There is a lot of violence and some language. Also, some slight nudity, but very non-sexual. Overall, I think this is one of the best anime ever
Fred Astaire met Ginger Rogers on the set of a previous film, FLYING DOWN TO RIO, where they were paired somewhat arbitrarily in one of those momentous decisions that, or so it seems from today's perspective, made the studio system seem to make sense.  You couldn't have really predicted the two would click on camera, for Fred's previous partner had been his own sister, and the two of them (Fred and Adele) had concentrated on the slightly nutty, zany dances together that did not require any sexual tension between partners.  (Think of the "Triplets" number in THE BAND WAGON.)   ---  --- As for Ginger, nothing in her previous screen or stage work hinted at any softness or vulnerability--she was, of course, hilarious at playing the sort of hard-edged blonde tramp parts that were too vulgar for Jean Harlow to play.  So matching them up was a gamble, but it sure did pay off, even if FLYING DOWN TO RIO gave them little room to show their stuff in.  One number, the incandescent "NIGHT AND DAY, changed the way people felt about them almost instantly, and even the never-ending CONTINENTAL, the longest and most tedious dance craze ever captured on film, could not douse the Promethean spark they created. ---  --- Hopefully sometime soon whoever owns the RKO catalogue will issue this gem--and its successors--on DVD.  If even FINIAN'S RAINBOW has come out on a great looking DVD presentation, why can't THE GAY DIVORCEE
I first saw this movie on satellite TV with my mom one winter vacation.  Recently, I was reminded of it, and remembered how wonderful it is.  Besides being an adorable story, the film is shot beautifully in black and white, which the DVD shows off perfectly.  I think it's much better than You've Got Mail, although I like that movie, too.  Definitely worth at least a rental
This cable is much more expensive when you try to buy it elsewhere.  I received the cable quickly and the company even sent me an email to let me know where to download the appropriate program free from the Samsung website.  Works great
This tea is great with a little sugar or honey. It is the kind of tea to have on a cold snowy winter day. Make a cup, sit back wrapped in an afgan, and let your mind wander as you sip this orange spice tasting tea. The longer you leave the tea bag in the hot water, the better. ---  --- Grandma Sharon from Illinois farm country
By chance before picking this up I had just finished The Heart is a Lonely Hunter by Carson McCullers, and was struck by the similarities and differences. It's a great "compare and contrast" pair, as an exercise for high-schoolers. ---  --- Both are written as first-person accounts by teen-aged girls and are roughly contemporary. Heart published in 1940, and Castle in 1948, both about life in the 30s.  ---  --- Both families are poor. In Castle though, there is never any question that the girls might go off and get jobs. This is supposedly because they "don't know how to do anything". So instead they sell off their belongings and get by on scraps of bread and the odd bit of butter. How charming! They are "eccentric", which seems enough in the author's eyes to exempt them from the expectation of supporting themselves. Only Stephen the handsome young son of the late housekeeper, enamored of Cassandra, does work and gives the family his entire salary. But he is of the class that is expected to toil after all. Even he is rewarded in the end--able to avoid labor with an easy job similar to that of step-mum Topaz--striking poses. ---  --- Unlike the looming and grinding poverty of Heart then, the poverty in the Castle never amounts to more than a lark--educated folks playing at being poor until they're rescued by romantic circumstance. Not so in America where Mick Kelly, who didn't know how to do anything either, went off to work at Woolworth's, and to a life of little hope. ---  --- In Castle the solution comes in the form of that classic deus ex machina, the inheritance. Two dashing young wealthy Americans one of whom has inherited the castle, show up just in time, with their chatty modern mum. They throw money around and talk too much, in the cliched extravagant American style. Most of the remainder of the novel consists of Cassandra and her sister Rose swooning over one brother or the other, with an eventual romantic result that assures all the characters of economic well being. ---   --- It's all so very charming, bourgeois, and harmless. If your life is hard don't worry--a man will show up to rescue you! ---  --- The reviews for this novel in Amazon are overwhelmingly positive. Smith was obviously talented. Her writing is elegant and a pleasure to read. I wish she had given Cassandra a little more ambition.
really enjoy using this as body wash.  the smell is divine, but the bubbles don't last long if used as a bubble bath or shampoo.  moisturizing to my dry skin
The reviewer below must have some other conflict with the game, because I am currently running a game of IWD1 with Windows XP as I make this post
This is a great starter board for the price.  My son has really enjoyed using it and the price was unbeatable.  Seems to be holding up well and it serves the purpose for a beginner
I didn't know much about grills so I asked around. Everyone told me to get a Weber grill, and after reading reviews I could see why. I just got my grill this weekend and we have used it 3 times already..we love it! Very sturdy/solid, and super easy to use. All you need to do is turn the gas on, turn a knob..and press the ignitor! Everything we have cooked has come out perfectly, very even cooking. This grill may not have all the bells and whistles, but you can bet it will last for years to come. 
These are some very nice shoes. I love the blue and black ones. These really should get some more publicity because the are better than all other basketball shoes. They are also very comfortable. If you want to get some high quality shoes for a good price, get T-Macs!!!!!!!!!!
I have three baby carriers. It seems eccessive but I never found one that really was doing it for me. I started with Gracco carrier and it turned out to be a nightmare everytime I had to put the baby inside. My son was crying while I was snapping all the 1001 snaps it has there but after that he was stopping crying even though he wasn't looking too confortable. ---  --- When he got older (5 mounths) we bought a backpack carrier. This is a really really a nice buy. We loved it and so did our son. The problem with it is that I wouldn't put a baby younger than 5 mounths inside.  ---  --- So when my other son was born we tried this new carrier. I think that's the best for newborns because they don't have to support any body part. More over, when the baby sleeps, he is in a nice position and they seem to like it (even though I though his head was in a weird angle ?!?!) As soon as the baby gets heavier (8 or 9 lbs) it's getting a bit uncomfortable mostly if you have I large breast as I do. It slips from its place so the head of the child doesn't stand on your shoulder anymore but on your lower chest (so when you have a large breast the baby's head is really really in a weird angle !). I think that it doesn't worth the price for the time you use it. Now that my younger son is 5 mounths, I don't use it anymore
This is a very enjoyable film in which everything, from the acting, to the music, to the costumes, is just right. It depicts an earlier, friendlier Los Angeles and makes one want to get into a time machine and go back.To an aviation nut such as myself, it is heaven, perfectly capturing the excitement of the golden age of aviation.  ---  --- The music fits the action so well. In fact, there is a performer on the air show circuit who does old time aerobatics and uses the the theme music from Rocketeer as his performance music. Most excellent! The joy and fun of this film carries beyond the actual watching of the film. I wish there were more movies like it
Jane Fonda was not only an excellent actress but a beautiful, if opinonated (remember Hanoi Jane?), woman.  I watched this as a teenager and despite the "striptease" this has to be one of her worst.  Hormones be damned, watching this was a waste of time.  If you like Fonda, try Klute.  She was an excellent actress --- but no one could survive this mess.     
 This is a great back pack! If there is anything I would change it would be the logo on the front. It's brite and shinny, and I'd rather not advertise that I have a camera in there! I colored it in with a felt pen and it works great....... Overall, I love the backpack!!  
This book is not about India or Indians.  Shallow characters.  Non existant plot.  A dismal end to a not terrible beginning.  Unlike one of the other reviewers, I was unlucky enough to buy this book - what a waste
I have had this for 1 month now and I love it. It does record the outdoor and indoor temp. You can change the display to either show both or only indoor with an expanded clock. We had owned another la crosse clock that is beamed onto the ceiling at night (also great!) and we did not have to set up another outdoor senser. Both clocks work off of the one to display the outdoor temp. Never have to worry about being late because of a clock loosing time. It is updated every 24 hours. I Love it
The Movie has always been a favorite of mine.  If you have a big screen TV, this movie on DVD will appear to be sloppy in some areas, but if you just follow the story and enoy the music, you'll over come the critical nit picking of your prefectionate self.  Go look in the mirror by the way. ---  --- I recommend this product for purchase
This is one of those books where you actually feel embarrassment for the author.  The book is poorly researched, poorly written and, well, words just fail me.  While I am not a great Herriot fan, I do have to give him his due - the man could write well and could tell a good story (isn't that what authors are suppose to do?) but this guy Graham Lord, I suspect, has problems feeding paper into his typewriter!  The intire book is such an obvious ploy to make some money on the shirttail of a "dead" and popular author, it is rather nauseating.  Shame on the publisher for accepting such shoddy work!  I did finish the book though (thank God I did not purchase the thing) because each page became worse and worse and I could not stop, thinking with each turn of the page "well it just cannot be any worse than that last page/chapter."  How wrong I was!  If you must read the thing, borrow it or check it out of a library.  I would hate to see a person waste their money, and I certainly would not want the author and his publisher to be rewarded for a work such as this.  Herriot's life, warts and all, could be such a fastinating subject.  I do hope someone will turn out a good study of him eventually.  We certainly did not get it here
These bristles have just the right combination of softness and strength.  However, since I only use this as a back scrub brush, the detachable design is not optimal for me.  After a few months, the brush-handle attachment point became compromised (probably from all the exposure to water), and I found that the brush would often detach from the handle as I scrubbed my back.  At this point, many more months down the road, the brush no longer stays mounted to the handle at all, so I am looking for a (non-detachable) replacement.  Even so, I recommend this product because of it's great bristles, and also because the handle was great while it lasted. 
I purchased this for my husband as a gift without ever having smelled it.  I based my purchase on other reviews, and the fact that I have the Burberry classic for women and love it.  I crossed my fingers and hoped that the reviews were right.  Well, they were!  When this came in I could not resist; I had to open the box.  I pulled the outer wrapping back, carefully pulled the box out (I was able to replace all this without hubby knowing), sprayed some into the air, and "ahhhh", wonderful!  I loved it! ---  --- It smells wonderful on my husband, too.  It's kind of woodsy, but not overpowering at all.  It's a classic, warm fragrance, and it lasts a long time. I will definitely buy this again
Quality was terrible, undersized or seconds. Later I saw the same product at a discount warehouse for 1/3 of this price. ---  --- I would not recommend these to anyone --- I paid and have been waiting 6 weeks for my credit. Amazon must protect buyers better or lots of business will go elsewhere. It is only when problems arist that the true color of the marketing company comes to the surface. I am disgusted with this product
This software does not provide even the basic red eye fix.  It turns them a light shade of grey, maybe. It is horrible.  This to me renders it useless.  ---  --- It is for the most basic of users.  There are no real manual functions to speak of, and my free software does a better red eye and also lets me do red eye manually when they cannot detect it.   ---  --- It has some neat functions but since it could not provide the most common need correctly,I would say do not buy.  Seller was great, product is poor.
This book clearly, easily teaches the 5 different ways we each relate to one another.    It is applies very well to couples; however, the principles also provide essential insight into relating with children, colleagues... anyone!  It makes an excellent group book study or a read-on-one's own
This mirror is unsatisfactory becasue the light is negligible and the magnification (5x) is not sufficient
The tomato, the other other white meat. It's whats for dinner.
This was a very disappointing product.  Amazon delivered it in great time, but Razor is very misleading about the quality of this product.  It is too flimsy to remain upright while grinding it.  It is frustrating to be told by the Razor customer service AFTER the purchase, that it should be bolted down to the ground or bolted to a piece of plywood.  There goes the portability of it!  VERY DISAPPOINTING!
i have had my bag for a couple of months.  the liner on the inside has already ripped
I use to subscribe to SHAPE several years ago, and then it was packed full of great work out routines, meal plans, etc for women at all levels of fitness.    ---  --- Well . . . my last few months of Shape have been a complete disappointment.  I found very few pages of good genuine fitness and healthy eating advice.  Instead, it ranks right up with Glamour in the category of magazines with the highest percentage of advertisements, nearly all of the excercise material is supposed "quick fix" fitness fluff which gives women very unrealistic expectations, and the healthy eating advise is absolutely elementary.   ---  --- There is no substance in here for women like me, the average working woman who desire to live a healthy life everyday and have limited time to commit to exercise.  I want a magazine that is inspiring with a focus on living a sustained healthy lifestyle, not a joke about getting flat abs in a week with illustrations of perfectly chiseled models who obviously do not face the body challenges of average women.  I'm sorry but most women are not going to look like "her" after two weeks, or many months of Shape's 10-30 minute a day routines, but they sure lead you to beleive so.  ---  --- I highly recommend "Her Sports"  it is THE magazine for women desiring to live an active, day-to-day healthy life
I bought the familiy fun pack ($65) from the ad on TV!  What a mistake!  When it arrived one tub was open and spilled all inside the box while another unopened tub was nearly dried out. No return label or customer service number was enclosed so I couldn't even return it! It is such a mess and smells like chemicals.  It stuck to a votive candle holder ok and it looks kind of cute but when you try to just mold it all it does is stick to EVERYTHING including your hands.  Some are really gooey like slimy paint while other tubs are nearly dry and you end up with micro-mini styrofoam beads all over the place and they sink down into the carpeting and won't come out.  Needless to say, it sat around for awhile until it finally made it's way to it's new home....the trash
We knew we could not just get one set.  Both kids have enjoyed using the pens. 
While I only am a little over half way through this book, I'm finding myself hating Will.  He's pathetic and boring and not at all a character that I can cheer for.  This book has been a tedious read overall.  I keep pushing through because I feel like it has to get better, yet so far it has not.  I'm happy that I checked this out from the library, so that I can return it and not have it collect dust on MY shelves.  The only reason why I'm even writing a review is that I'm so shocked about all the positive comments this book has received thus far.  I looked on Amazon to see if my thoughts were shared by others; I'm surprised that they are not.  I usually like this genre of fiction, but in terms of this book all it is is a bunch of whining and self-loathing
This book is simply incredible.  A more stimulating book I couldn't  imagine!  It's not that it told me so much I didn't know intuitively, but  seeing it written so distinctly in black and white really hit home.  This  is one to read if you really want to get a sense of just how dramatically  the world has changed.  Neal Gabler, tells it like he sees it and has a lot  of research to back up his views.  I love that he doesn't make judgements  or try to press an opinion on the reader.  It's left up to you to decide  how you feel about it all.  I find myself thinking of points he brought up  throught the day and seeing just what he meant by experiencing it in  "real" life.  The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because I  wish it was a bit MORE in-depth.  It's so engaging that I can imagine an  entire college course being made from this book.  It is a book that's as  entertaining as it is informative, and that's the whole point
Awesome shoe!! Very comfortable on my feet. Even though it's high healed sneacker you really don't fee too much of height and none of it's negetive side affects. I can actually run in this. Only thing is that it looks little too casual and your feet can get really HOT wearing it. I would recommend wearing thin sox. I originaly brought Dark Brown in size 7 (normally wear 6 or 6 1/2 size shoe) but had to return it to get 6. way too big. It's  wider than I'm used to even though I have wide feet; offers plenty of toe room.  If they offer 6 1/2 size , it would have been perfect wearing my thick sox in winter. Unfortunetely there are no half sizes offered. I wanted to buy Black in 6 also, but 7 is too big and  smaller sizes tend to go fast and there are no more option for me now
Don't buy if you plan on printing often...runs out very very fast. 
You might have to pay a little bit more but the reliability offered by OEM products gives one much peace of mind. I am always willing to wait a little longer and pay a little more if I know what I am getting is not just a counterfeit. I think I got my money's worth
This is a resource used by all NPs I have talked to.  Great addition to your library. 
This is the same system released 4+ years ago.(This is the Fanny Lifter-not the Box and not the Transfirmer-the wider steps.)   ---  --- I was very out of shape-couldn't make it up stairs without being out of breath.  It was very tough starting up...I couldn't make it through a whole workout until almost the 10th workout.  I went from a size 16 to a size 6.  Because of this system I have fallen in love with exercise and feeling/looking great! ---  --- Allie, Lisa and Jen are great leads
I found these diapers while searching for the 7th generation brand diapers. I was impressed and eager to try Tushies because there was no chlorine and no gell used to produce them, I ordered the medium size for my 20lb baby. The diapers came sooner then expected, which was great. My single star rating comes from my experience using them. They have no elastic and they are stiff which makes it hard to get a super snug fit. It seems like no matter how tight I can get the diapers my son leaks through them, out the sides and up the belly. Because the moisture does not wick away from his skin he also developed a diaper rash- his first and we have been only using these diapers for a week
*No Spoilers* --- We had enough of lame Japanese films. This new "wave" of horror movies like "The Ring," "Pulse" and now "The Grudge 2" doesn't seem to have an end. The genre is played out but that didn't stop the producers from creating this sequel which is a sad and incomprehensible follow-up of the decent 2004 first version. To understand this film--which is nearly impossible until the end--you would have to see the first movie. ---  --- Brief Story: --- The film has basically three plots, but in a way they are connected to each other. The first plot is a follow-up of what happened to Karen Davis (Sara Michele Gellar) who barely survived the ghosts of the haunted house. Mrs. Davis (Joanna Cassidy) asks her other daughter Aubrey to investigate what happened to her sister Karen. She travels to Japan to bring Sara home. Now in Japan, she finds her in the hospital very paranoid about the ghosts of the house, but something terrible is about to happen. ---  --- The second plot is about three school girls who visit the haunted house. One of the girls has to go to the closet for some kind of initiation that we don't know about. Suddenly the girl sees the ghost of the child. She tries to get out but the door jammed. They all panic and leave the girl in the closet with the ghost. Unfortunately, they are about to find out the hard way that the place was not to be visited.  ---  --- The third plot takes place in the US where a new family moves to an old building. A young kid suddenly notices that the building is haunted and the "strange lady" that lives next door has something to do with it. People are starting to act weird in this building because of the evil presence.  ---  --- Review: --- Less scary and sillier than the original, "The Grudge 2" takes you to a boring and confusion movie experience. The movie suffers from too many plots that confuse the audience rather than scare them. We have to wait until the end to find out how everything relates to each other. This time around the ghosts are outsourcing from Japan to the US. They don't care whether you visit the house or not. Now these menaces are getting medieval to people for no apparent reason. These ghosts behave now like viruses that will haunt and kill whoever is on their way--even a young little boy--just to show their rage. The so-called scary moments are not scary at all. They are lame, mechanical and cheap imitations of the original 2004 first version. What's sad is that, this time around, the writers have to make the actresses show some "skin" to please the male teen audience. This is what the filmmakers have to use to get some kind of momentum going for this movie. ---  --- In the technical department the movie doesn't do a good job either. The editing is very sloppy and extremely confusion. We have three plots that are poorly mixed together. Sometimes we are in Japan and sometimes the ghosts are outsourcing in the US. The photography of the film is identical to its predecessor, but that's the only thing that resemblances the original. In the sound department, the movie will make you laugh. We hear sillier noises than the original. Instead of getting scared, you might laugh at the sounds these ghosts make--We personally like the angry "kitty" sound. ---  --- The Verdict: --- A terrible sequel of a decent horror film, "The Grudge 2" could have been a straight-to-video release if it wasn't for the beautiful Sara Michelle Gellar. No scary moments but many funny ones--unintentionally, of course. --- 
CliC Eyewear is a thoroughly convenient way to wear reading glasses. I keep them with me hung around my neck all the time.  The glasses are made well.  Almost every person who sees me click them together wants to know where I got them
It seems surprising that Canon would make a product out of anything but the best materials.  Lensmate makes a superior product out of aluminum in black and silver
A lot of people are meriting Ja's credibility on all his albums because he has been able to keep his voice on the airwaves since 1998. So he released his sophomore album Rule 3:36 in Sept 2000, that is one of the worst Ja albums I've heard (not the worst, The Last Temptation takes that title).  ---  --- Ja tries to be "gangstafied" on this album but fails terribly. Starting with the first single "Me & You" thinking his thug style can attract women. I haven't bought the concept in 2000, and I'm still not buying it six years later. Or how about the flat falling track "F*** You" featuring Vita and 01? ---  --- Or as many revewers have pointed out that he tries to boast his singing vocals on this album, which seriously damages his creditablity. How about the song "Put It On Me" before Lil Mo joined song. Sounds wack(er) with out her. Or how about the late Barry White imitation on the song "Extacy" (and thats one of the decent tracks on this album). Oh and remember when "Between Me & You" was highly antacipated that you downloaded the single on Napster? Well do you remember that the origonal/demo that some of you downloaded didn't have Christina Millian singing the hook, but had Ja singing it himself. Thank god that wasn't on the album.   ---  --- Now there are some listenable tracks on this album that I would like to point out. "6 Feet" is a standout track, and is possibly the best track on this album and my personal favorite. "Watching Me" is another tight track, as Ja spits with a load of energy within him. "I Cry" and as mentioned earlier "Extacy" are decent at best. Other than that, most of the tracks on this album are skippable. ---  --- Overall, a sub medicore Ja Rule album. Most of the 4 and 5 star reviewers are either big time Ja Rule fans or just in love with mainstream overrated rap ("Put It On Me" [Remix]). To me, this album is nothing else but a pop rap, falsafied thug rap album that just doesn't appeal to me. I recommend this to hardcore Ja Rule fans if they don't have this already. ---  --- Lyrics: C --- Production: C+ --- Guest Appearances: C- --- Musical Vibes: D- ---  --- Favorite Tracks: Watching Me, 6 Feet, Die, Extacy ---  --- Honorable Mention Track : Chris Black (skit
We used this every single night with our son and even bought the next size up when he outgrew the small size. He was sleeping through the night almost immediately. Part of that was because he was so comfy when swaddled. We used this for four months until he learned to flip to his belly and needed his arms free. A def must have for every baby
I bought two copies of this SACD, both had glitches and would not play in my player correctly, be forewarned. I dont have any other problems with other SACDs so I assume it is in the production somewhere. They would lock up for no reason, this is right out of the box, both copies.
I bought these slippers for my mother, who is 5 years post stroke.  She has difficulty keeping shoes and slippers on because she has no feeling in her left foot since her stroke.  Also she is always cold even when it is 80+ degrees outside.  These slippers have been wonderful.  They fit her well, they stay on and they keep her feet warm. --- When she wears these out will definitly by another pair
This game has no board therefore no time is wasted trying to move from one room to another to make accusations. The luck in this game depends on which sleuth cards you draw rather than rolls of the dice. Strategy is the same as the original game only game play moves more quickly with one being able to gather information on nearly every turn they have. Sometimes you can actually eliminate more than one item on your list during your turn. All in all, this is a fun game that you can play over and over again in an evening with out getting bored with it
Driving physics are as unrealistic as they can get.  Obtaining licenses is extremely difficult, made worse by poor car physics.  Your heavy car easily bounces off light cars, while light cars easily derail your heavy car.  Turning the steering wheel only slightly produces heavy tire squeal, and that's with sports tires! ---  --- Long gone are the ESPN-like replays of GT 2.  For some reason cars look thinner than before.  The analog tachometer has been reduced to just a bar across the screen.  The 3D mechanics can be headache prone, made worse by the poor physics of the cars.  Easily the most inadequate music ever. ---  --- The game makes you start with a used model of only certain makes, which is nothing new.  However, it takes a long time to earn any money for a better car.  Only 7 horsepower upgrades make huge differences on the track?!  The game has mostly only newer models, almost none from a few years ago, unlike in GT 2. ---  --- The only good thing about this game is that you don't have to drive all the time.  The B-Spec driving mode can win races for you.  Just leave for a few minutes and return to a victory screen.  This can help in skipping the painful, early parts of the game. ---  --- The powertrain is still not modifiable.  Compression, bore, stroke, camshaft timing/overlap, valve size, and other engine characteristics are still not available.  With poor driving physics, engine modification would not have helped this game. ---  --- Loading times are very long, with the most annoying loading indicator ever.  Constant auto saving feature is quick but can become annoying.  There is an excessive amount of confirmation screens. ---  --- This game is a yet another disappointment, much like GT 3 was.  The makers of this game made it quite clear that if you want to know what the real cars drive like, you will have to drive them for real.  The Gran Tourismo series are over, unlikely to return to what they used to be.  I'm not a racing game fan, but only GT 2 was good enough for me to buy.  If you want good, car make-independent physics, you need to play Gran Tourismo 2.
I would have to say this was a brilliant movie. I was highly entertained from this Mr.Corman and Hill flick. Beautiful women getting roughed up, from the somewhat feminine guards. Pam Grier gets your full attention
I love The Tingler! Each metal tip feels great.  I personally like the COPPER version a little better than the SILVER version.  It's a little gentler and softer but I know some people find it too soft and like the SILVER version instead.  Before the tingler, sometimes I would use one end of my glasses (the end that fits over the ear) but of course my glasses are fragil and I would risk damaging them.  It also feels really good on the back and actually all over, not just on the head
You get a few outfits and some new furniture but not a lot.  With all of the free stuff out there to download for The Sims, the Stuff Pack is not very worth it.  Maxi is just milking the franchise for every penny
After reading several comments I tried to proof my scale is working properly. However, like someone else wrote the scale is not consistant. I weight myself several times and noticed very considerable diferrences in readings. Like some one else I even tried placing an additional amount of weight in my hands. The scale gave me several readings for the same amount of weight. Now! A digital scale is supposed to be percise..
I have used this software from the very first as a PaintShop product and it still delivers. It has improved with this version. I reckon I have tried all other albums and quick editors but this remains the best. For more detailed work a more expansive editor is needed but that is not the purpose of this program. What it claims to do, it does well. If only it had some way of adjusting the mid tones. A simple histogram would make this a top ranking program
Great purchase. If you like to keep your vehicle looking good and don't have a lot of time to wash it when it is only dusty, then this is a great time saver. Takes only minutes and looks like it was just cleaned. Well worth the money.  
Musicals are historically slight in the plot department, and this movie is no exception.  Three stars: one fading, one rising and one coasting do not help matters either. ---  --- Rita is the fading star.  It was painful for me to watch the once dazzling love goddess reduced to playing the controlling widow.  The make up department probably had to work overtime trying to cover the circles under her eyes, and her hair and costumes are just bad.  Novak is the rising star, although I don't get the 50's obsession with bubble headed, busty, bleach blond bimbos.  It would help if she could act, but sadly her range is very limited. I truly believe they added the dog to help make her character sympathetic, since she was unable to convey it herself.  Then there is Frank just coasting on his charm and cool.  Doesn't seem plausible that a hep cat like him, who could bag any "doll", "dame" or "mouse?", would fall for either of these gals. ---  --- Anyway, I gave it 2 stars because of Snuffy the dog.  He stole every scene he was in.  Although that wasn't too difficult to do in such a dog of a movie
I really didn't enjoy the movie, but  I had to finish it.  The hypocrisy of Faith and her sidekicks mirrored so many of the so-called fundamentalist that I know, but the ignorance and hopelessness of the others were terrifying.   --- This movie presented a very perverted view of Christianity.  Though there was alot of talking about Jesus and saying His name, it was clear that no one in the entire movie actually KNEW HIM and spent time with Him.  When Mary gets a revelation from something she believes is Christ that opposed the actual Word of God, she finds someone who is crazier than the average nut to confirm her decision.  Christ does not tell anyone to do things that goes against His Word.  No one actually reads a Bible in the movie.  Consequently, most made many life-damaging decisions.   --- I hated the "reality" of the movie, but it has challenged me to actually spend time with Christ and learn about Him. I shudder to think that I could live long enough to present such a twisted veiw of what Christianity truly is. 
The only good thing about this product is its price (I saw it being sold at $160 on some other site). There are several shortcomings though: --- - The greatest drawback is the complexity of the menu. There is no 'home location'. Also there are only two navigation options available - shortest time & shortest distance. So if you are caught in a traffic jam for example, there is no 'detour' function. Also, you cannot see the next few turns when you are navigating. Hence you cannot plan if you immediately need to turn right after a left or vice versa. --- - The maps are probably very old. I used this device in NJ, VA & MN. In every state, I faced problems multiple times, when the unit did not know that the road bifurcated ahead & it would not tell me to keep on left/right, or it would ask me take turns when there were none.  --- - The unit was very slow in calculating routes (I dont know how the Sirf Star III chip helps). Also it would freeze often & I would need to reset it at critical junctions. --- - The viaMichellin website is only dedicated to Europe. When I went to register my product, I had to register it in viaMichellin UK, since there was no option for US! I dont think they have any support for the US models. --- - The POIs are very less compared to other competitors within the same price range. ---  --- I returned this product after trying to make it work for 2 months. It was great on part of Amazon to accept it even after expiration of return policy (although they deducted 20% restocking fee).
this soundtrack does NOT have all the songs in it from the movie.  i was looking for two from the movie, and the soundtrack did not have them.  like, a song by michelle branch that is in the movie is not in there.  bo
This is good stuff -- has a very nice spice to it.
One of the worst films of a generation.  Many talented comedic  (Dave Thomas - Colleen Camp) were wasted in this decrepit piece of digital doggeral. 
The 'blue' body ball that was sent to me was not blue. It's white with some blue print. The pump didn't work right so I used a rocket type pump that came with a ball I had purchased from another company. Plugs and pumps seem to be interchangeable. The quality of the 'blue' ball is good. When I opened the box it looked like the ball was the wrong size but it expands to the 65cm. My first thought was wrong color, wrong size. No inflation directions enclosed in box only an excercise chart. Ball is OK, pump is not. I was not happy but didn't want the return hassle. If you aren't fussy about color and have a back-up pump, go for it.
Nice bracelet for the price. Good for gifts for friends (which is what I purchased them for) Everyone was very happy with them
This is a good size cot for a smallish boy scout.  It's a little small for an adult, but it fits in the tent well. The only complaint is it requires a lot of strength to set up and take apart, but it is lightweight and comfortable
This is the worst ripoff of a major literary work I have ever seen. It takes colossal gall (to say nothing of immense bad taste) to take the bare bones of a Dostoevsky novella & tack on every possible bodice-ripper cliche in movies & then try to interweave Dostoevsky's own personal travails as narrative interstices. All done with no flair for nor flavor of the original.  ---  --- The acting is strictly mid-20th century nyah-ha-ha Masterpiece Theater while the casting is about as suitable as Ray Winstone in his infamous Henry VIII turn. ---  --- I got this just to see the great Luise Rainer. Now I will dispatch this disk to the dustbin where it will surely be outclassed
My Mom always said that the Rectal thermometer was the best but when she used the speed one on me I found out my temperature right away and that was so cool and I like how it even does it quicker rectally than orally so I dont mind a rectal temp now and you know what? My brothers are even doing it that way and one of them is 16 yrs old.
unfortunatlly i got a dvd that dosnt work.... he lagnguge is not english and when i tried changing and choosing english lang. it dosnt repond... so am stuck with i
Our hero,amoral in his love life, refusing to kick his unfaithful ex-wife to the curb, and making mystery solving boring, why continue? Parker can write like no one else, but his recent plots suggest the well may be dry
I put in two AA batteries, went to sleep and the next morning woke up to find the time, moon phase, date and temp set and accurate. Very cool product. I hang it on a wall about 8 feet up and have no problem seeing the display from 20' away and from an angle of 45-50 degrees. It is not completely viewable from the sides, but there is no annoying ticking and it beats my $10 Ikea analog clock hands down. Good for a small apartment.
ISBN-1581700296 Black Leather Non-Indexed KJV ---  --- This is a beautiful bible. Every verse is colored and each color stands for something such as Love, Family, Faith, Salvation, etc. It also has the center column reference, a one year bible reading schedule, a daily verse lisiting with, of course, 365 verses, one for each day of the year, various maps and pictures, outlines of each book, and a list of 100 popular bible verses, 50 from the old testament and 50 from the new. There is also a section in the front of the book that explains the color system and gives examples as well. It is also available in NIV as well as KJV.  ---  --- I'd highly suggest this bible to anyone, but shop around. The one I bought listed at amazon for $77.99 but I bought it at a local bookstore for $39.99 plus tax. Same book, same ISBN exactly.  --- 
I just tried filling my propane tank with the quick disconnect connector and was told by the dealer that this type of connector has now been banned by the government and he could not fill my tank.  I called Weber and they confirmed this.  Probably a safety concern although I never had a problem.  I will now need to replace my grill LP hose with the screw on type of connector (QCC1 connection). 
 This magazine is one of the alltime best mags for men. It has everything you want, including hot babes, cars, gadgets, and sexy bikinis. It is also very cool in that it can turn you on to some cool stuff, like the new watches they showed by Fossil and DKNY, and some excellent Martini recipes, and then they turned me on to a DVD called "NEW SEX NOW"  ---  which has greatly enhanced my reputation with the ladies. ---  --- I, for one, am hooked.
am very pleased with my purchase, speedy shipping will use agai
I have three holes in each ear and I really needed some tiny diamond earrings for the top holes.  These are wonderful! They are small, but exactly what I wanted. Such a great buy for this price
I love this  doll house and all its furniture. It was very average no fake looking dolls and I loved the office furniture for the doll house. We have had a lot of fun playing with it including me. It is good for my daughter and I to spend time playing together.
Works great with my SCH-A950 and BitPim..
  I am writing to offset some negative opinions on this unit. I bought the Canon because it has facilities for an external mike. I am a new camcorder user and so have no practical experience to bias my opinion one way or another. First on the matter of tape drive noise: yes I can hear it if I put the unit up to my ear. But no noticeable noise comes up on actual movie clips when played back through my computer. Second, they claim you can interconnect and capture clips to your computer. What they don't tell you is that you need a Firewire card and cable (about $70.00 total at Best Buy). You cannot simply hook up through the available computer USB port. Fortunately, Microsoft provides the necessary drivers in the XP OS and minimal capture software called "Moviemaker".  ---  ---  I am not too pleased with the tape system but considering the price of the unit, I think it is a bargain. Finally, I have become aware through short experience with the unit that the ergonometric design for the right hand was very well thought out. Your thumb easily controls on/off and tape transport functions. It is really easy to use, at least for right handed users. All considered, I am satisfied with the product. Of course, if it dies next week, I will have a different opinion
Purchased these for my husband. He absolutely loves these sandals. He initially thought the little nubbies would feel strange. However, he got over that thought fast when he slipped them on and went tromping around the yard. He uses them for a quick slip-on shoe to run outdoors. Wears them every day. Thanks for a nice slip-on! Also these are sturdy though very light weight
I just mailed those back this past week to Beall's in Florida.  However, --- when the mailman took it from my mailbox (I am 83 and no car) he brought it back the next day because of insufficient postage on it.  There was $l.71 due.  So, I put  (5) 39 cent stamps on it, which would have been  --- $1.95.  However, the next day the mailman brought it back and there were only 3 additional stamps instead of the 5 I  had put on  it.  I called the post office, and fortunately, the postmistress believed I was being honest, and told me to send it back with the mailman.  He wasn't a happy camper, but I did send it back, and I trust that she went ahead and mailed it for me.  I was concerned that it might have been too late for an exchange.  Other than the fact that the pants were too large in the legs and around the hips....they were okay, but by that time, I had changed my mind about them, too. --- Also, I had bought these with a gift certificate from my granddaughter and never could find a place to apply it. --- Jeanne Alle
2GB SanDisk is awesome. I can store lots of files in my PDA and not worry about space. Also the price was very afordable
I have purchased a total of 12 of these batteries (6 two-packs) and I must say that they work exactly how I projected them to. They hold a charge well enough for my uses in  various electronics and my infant's papasan swing. Regular Duracell alkalines will keep the swing running for a few days. These batteries on a full charge almost match the alkalines' life and I have recharged and reused many times already with no sign of charge loss. I am very pleased so far with my purchase. Get these until hybrid nimh batteries in size D become easily available and cheaper
I use the Medela pump - but their thin bottles and simple caps don't seem like they have the ability to keep the milk fresh. I love the heavy Advent bottles and the caps have a rubber ring in them to really seal the bottle
My dad and I wanted to play as a guitar duo, me playing on the twelve string acoustic and him on an ACOUSTIC BASS. His bass had built in electronics making it electric also. My guitar had a built in tuner but his didn't. Needing a tuner was must have. Buying this tuner was the best accessory I've bought yet. It's the best of all worlds. Good looking, easy to use, and also very small. I recommend this item to any who needs a tuner for their guitar
Brilliant. Sam Harris portends the calamitous pathway that irrational, divisive thinking (religious & secular) will cause. He also spells out the necessary suggestions and goals for humans to evolve to the point where we're globally not at risk of suffering due to anachronistic prejudices
Review by Mike Watson: ---  --- With the recent slew of Victory Records releases, not to mention the wide variety; one can be to say the least skeptical of any of their assortment of new releases.  However, picking through all of the less notable releases from the label, the up-and-coming band, The Forecast, have stepped to the plate and scored a home run on Late Night Conversations.  The Forecast are a perfect blend of male and female vocals over a very modern rock soundtrack, executed flawlessly over a ten song full length. ---  --- Late Night Conversations is an album confronting different topics ranging from relationships to the teen trend of mutilation and loathing.  The harmonies arranged by both vocalists are undeniably catching and well written and the music follows closely in suit leaving your head bobbing back and forth to the beat and your feet tapping almost involuntarily. The Forecast is not only a great recorded band, but bring the same toe tapping energy to the stage, with both great stage presence and cohesion as a band.  The Forecast will defiantly be one of the new big bands in poppier rock music, and checking their Victory Records debut out is a must for fans of the genre.
We just love Nonni's Biscotti products -- especially the limone!  It's always refreshing -- not too sweet/not too tart.  Finding them on Amazon was exciting because we haven't found them locally since coming to Florida.  The product offered by Amazon was also a great bargain
 I liked the book but you also have to consider the end killer... Is that logical at all?? The senator is in his late fifties and so how old is his father? If he had the senator when he was twenty he'd have to be 77. Is it really reasonable that he's running around killing people, and setting houses on fire. It was a very unlikely twist to the end. It still was a good book
I recently recieved this gift as a birthday present.  The batteries that it came with had a little juice in them already, and since the directions said to discharge them completely before charging for the first time, I fired off a few dry rounds and a few BB's.  The blowback is quite impressive; I find myself shooting dry rounds just to see that nice blowback action.  The batteries are charged via putting them in the gun and attaching the charger to the pistol butt - so far, I've had no problems.  The gun looks and feels authentic.  I have not tried the flashlight during games just yet, though it seems very powerful (after shining it in my eyes accidentaly :p).  The main problem I had was with the magazine.  To get it out of the gun, you must pull it out; there is no magazine release button.  This wasn't too much of a problem for me, just new.  However, when I was loading the BB's into the magazine NORMALLY, the two halves of it popped open, sending the spring and BB's flying.  I put it back together and taped the sides together as reinforcement, and it works fine now.  Recommended for all not-so-hardcore players.
The maps are good enough for navigation of streets and outdoor adventures.  It allows downloading tracks and waypoints from the GPS, editing them and saving to files or the GPS.  It is annoying to have to put the last CD in your drive to use the program
I've had this high chair for a year now, and I love it.  My daughter plays with it every day, and it's worn great.  It still looks as good as the day we put it together.  I love that it's wood, rather than cheap plastic, and it's a pretty white with pink gingham, which I think is adorable.  The material has held up great and still looks perfect.  The wood is sturdy, with no cracks.  It fits all my daughter's dolls, including her large Cabbage Patch doll.  If I were going to change anything, I'd like a little bar in the front of the seat that would prevent the babies from slipping through (like real high chairs).  For the most part, her babies stay put, but sometimes they slip down and out.  It's not a big problem, though.  Our friends bought the same one a year ago for their daughter, and feel the same way about it.  We love the Badger Basket product line!  I highly recommend this product
I was looking forward to purchasing this item until I got to the final step of the order process where it shows the shipping cost.  The cheapest shipping would run me 14.99 for an item costing 21.89.  Sorry WeatherBuffs, you lost a sale due to your ridiculous shipping price. 
I wrote a rave review of these the day I got them.  They were absolutely terrific and gave me purchase doing yoga on a slippery rug.  However, the next time I wore them for a longer session, they got stretched out. My toes kept falling out of them and they became twisted around my feet and just generally got in the way.  ---  --- I put on a new pair for another session and when doing any lunges or poses with my legs in a wide stance, they were very uncomfortable.  ---  --- Oh well.  The "concept" is great, but they don't really work unless you're doing very little movement.  I wish someone would come up with something like this that does the job
Zed (Sean Connery) hitches a ride inside of a giant, flying, stone head. Once aboard, he shoots it's occupant dead and flies off to "The Vortex", a place where the "Eternals" live. This is a land full of men and women who have no sense of what real living is all about. They just loll around, musing and pontificating about nothing. Zed spices things up for these immortal buffoons by being different and, oh yeah, by having a male organ that works! I kid you not! The rest is mainly Zed finding out that what he thought would be heaven is actually pretty dull. Unfortunately, so is this movie! John Boorman (Deliverance, Excalibur) wrote, produced, and directed this elephant tranquilizer. Although, it does get an extra star for that hilarious flying head..
Although the stories and interviews in The Strand are well worth reading, I think it is worth saying that there are not many stories per issue, and, at least in the case of John Mortimer's Rumpole stories, they are taken from forthcoming books. That being said, The Strand is worth the four stars I've given it, but I would describe it as a "coffee-table" magazine, if such a category exists, due to its glossy pages, large size format, and relatively low number of stories and interviews in content
Oh man, this sucks really bad. Good thing nu-metal is dead. THRASH METAL IS REAL METAL, this is for posers
Every one is obbsessed with "Hips don't lie". Don't they relize that the songs horrible. Well, so is every other track on this album. Save your money to waste on something that is atleast some what decent
I take no pleasure in this review.  I just received (March 2007) my 3rd pair of Vasque Sundowners. I'd used up my GTX Sundowners (4th pair of Vasque boots) that I've had for about 3 years.  This is the first pair that squeaks.  I like good shoes, and I like taking care of them.  I had always been proud to wear Vasque, but the quality of these is just not that great.  The leather is thinner, and is dimpling, so they even look cheaper.  It's a shame, I wish Red Wing (another brand I`ve enjoyed in the past) had not acquired Vasque. It is the end of a great tradition
This is Beck's coming of age album.  "Loser" was a single that was designed from the bottom up to be a hit single and "Mellow Gold" landed Beck right smack center of mainstream pop culture for an entire generation.  His earlier recordings, featured in an album entitled "One Foot In The Grave," were evidence enough of his musical genius.   ---  --- "Mellow Gold" might have represented an electro-acoustic adolescence for Beck.  If that's the case, then "Mutations" was his rite of passage, a moment of maturation that moves beyond the playful tongue-in-cheek wittiness of his previous album.  "Mutations" has dark, brooding moments with haunting melodies.   ---  --- His lyrics inspire curiosity and sadness.   In one song, he sings, "Looking back on some dead world, that looks so new."  We can't always be sure of his references or implications, but the music in this album is fascinating and darkly beautiful.  His ambiguity of language is infectious and the compositions that he rests his words in are dynamic and graceful.   ---  --- With "Mutations," Beck has secured an important place in music history.  This is a body of work that really goes far beyond album sales and radio play.  The arrival of this album shows us an artist finding a moment of clarity and touching the world with his craft.     
We expose our babies/toddlers to a wide variety of cultural sources, in several languages.  Therefore, having seen similar products it seemed logical to purchase this one, given it is touted as a multilingual introduction to their environment (our little ones are trilingual: English, Spanish and ASL, and they ignore us in all them!).  Big mistake.  The video not only reinforces but solidifies the sexist portrayal of love so prevalent in other Baby Einstein (BE) items.  In earlier BE products one could see only female hands manipulating objects as they presented them on screen.  Male hands were never present.  This video goes many steps furhter by featuring male figures only in the background, or at best, an elderly man briefly interacting with a child.  Everywhere else you see multiple females lovingly playing, caring or otherwise being nurturing to children.  Males are only seen (with the exception of a black couple in bed while kids jump to play with them) in a distant background in entirely detached attitudes, or at least distant, dry and quiet poses, such as talking with a much older (male) child.  It is as if they are shown there as part of the domestic landscape, however as movable and inane as potted plants, whom you can move and place at will.  I felt insulted by this condescending and disqualifying view of male love and nurturing abilities. ---  --- Asides, when you go into the Spanish version, it is (for a professionally produced video) riddled with mistakes.  Three objects are mislabeled.  In the first, when a cup - the plastic or paper tall type , not the coffee and saucer version, it is called "la taza", when in reality it should be "el vaso", as unlike English, where it is interchangeable "vaso" is  the specific word for that item.  The second - much worse instance, still in the kitchen was to introduce a bowl.  There, the clueless scripter translated it as "el bol", a clear and poor corruption of the English word into a one commonly used in Spanglish, instead of calling it "tazo'n", as its correct name is.  The last one I saw was in the yard (I'm suprised they didn't call it la yarda!: "Looka mami! get la troca and go a la marketa a buy a boncha de carrotas!").  This time they called an obvious swing (two ropes and a seat in between) "la hamaca", when in reality hamaca means hammock.  Fortunately, we are native speakers amnd are abel to catch these pitfalls, but many people relies upon these products to teach their kids other languages.   ---  --- In sum I was discusted with the whole thing.    ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  --- 
When I think of an almond cookie, I think of something sweet, especially given the description of this product.  The smell of almond is so overpowering, its all I can smell.  I didn't catch vanilla or sandalwood.  I've already returned my products
Excellent software to manage your large backup hard drives. You can format, partition, split, merge and a whole lot of other things. If you purchase a large backup hard drive I recommend this software and the Acronis True Image software. With both, you can partition your drive and have a ghost copy of your c:\ drive in one partition and daily backups of My Documents in another. This way in case of a HD crash you have a bootable backup. (Note that the software that comes with backup hard drives will not make a bootable backup of your hard drive.) Thats why I recommend both Acronis software packages
Just like the ones used in college intra-murals, excellent stitching and look to be very durable.  Fast shipping, and great deal
Photoshop CS 2 is in a league of it's own. It can be used to do professional photo retouching and correcting but it is also probably the best painting package out there. It's not perfect however. There are some features that high end compositing and color grading programs like Inferno and DaVinci have that Photoshop could use, and the warper is just bare bones but then we're talking big bucks and no doubt Photoshop will eventually have something like them. Except for a few filters, it can function in 16 bits per channel which was a long time coming but now it's here, making it a professional product. Still, as far as I'm concerned, the ultimate paint program has yet to be written
Illuminator is shown in ad, but a generic brand was shipped to me.  The light wasn't as bright and it wasn't made very well.The crank was cheaply made, and the button that you press didn't work every time. 
Decent camera, but not great.  Shark mode is nice.  Housing looks good, but mine leaked at ~20 ft...camera was dead by the time I got it out of the water.  Good news is that Amazon processed the defective product return rapidly and credited my account in about a week.  Net result was one decent picture and a disappointing Christmas present.  Next time I will buy a housing for a better camera.  Canon has some nice ones
The only drawback is the lack of height adjustment.  Otherwise it's comfortable with a tall back and large seat
We have had it on our patio for about 4 months and it works great, the numbers are clear enoungh to see from our pool area
This album was one of my biggest "mistakes" (bought it 3 years ago). --- It's childish songwriting and really not good enough for an alternative-rock-band.  --- Better you buy instead: UP THE BRACKET (THE LIBERTINES) or --- some STROKES-stuff..
This hoodie is very poorly made. I bought a blue version and I had to return it after washing it in COLD water on GENTLE. It faded substantially, changed shape, and the threading came loose. Not recommended!!
This is one of the best tasting teas I have used. Keeps well in the refrigerator for two days, retaining its excellent flavor.  I reccommend this tea to everyone, and have shared with many family and friends
I admit it -- sometimes I just forgot to check to see if the cat wanted back in. The Driveway Patrol fixed all that. Setup about a foot or less off the ground in a relatively sheltered location by the front door, it does a great job of watching the front of the driveay and the front door. I originally set the sensor up to look down the entire length of the drive but it proved much too sensitive for this to be useful so I aimed the sensor low ACROSS the driveway near the front door and this has worked out fine. It now tells me when the cat is ready to come in as well as when a pizza or package delivery has arrived.  ---  --- The Driveway Patrol actually saved me quite a bit of trouble one day when I had been waiting the entire afternoon for the cable guy -- he eventually showed up late, didn't even bother to knock or ring the bell and only stayed just long enough to leave a note telling me I wasn't home. Due to the Drveway Patrol, I managed to wave him down at the end of the drive. This alone made the gadget worth the price. ---  --- As I've said, the Driveway Patrol does exactly what I need it to do. The only false alarms I get are from visiting neighbor cats, racoons and the odd bird. The only things I would change about the gadget would be to add a volume control that had more settings than 'loud' and 'very loud' and the fact that the chimes will ring continuously while being triggered and then for another 10-15 seconds beyond that
Agree 100%, very comfy. Besides making the ideal for everyday use, the fabric is so soft that is very hot to the touch. The look is very sexy. So they are good in both sides: comfy and sexy
My [...] really likes this train puzzle. He knows his alphabet and is able to pick out which puzzle piece comes next in line and attach it. It goes straight across and is over 10 feet long. There is also a picture with each letter on the piece and this has helped him with words beginning with that letter. He will say "Q quail" or "N nut" when he is putting the piece on. The pieces are easy to attach, thick and very sturdy. The pieces comes apart with no worry of ripping the picture off. This would make a really nice gift for a 2-4 year old. The box is also very nice to keep the puzzle in.
The Snow Goose is a beautifully written book that lingers in the memory long after the hour or so that it takes to read.  Set on the coast of England at the time of Dunkirk, it is less about the strife of WWII itself than about its three main characters - one of whom is the snow goose - and what binds them.  It is a story about nature, love, and nobility of spirit.  To say more would be to give too much away.  But it has had a place on my bookshelf for decades, and I reread it when I need to be reminded what is important in life
I loved ths retractable cord hair dryer when I first bought it about a year ago.  Now it's starting to stop running.  It appears to be a short in the power cord in the inclosed casing.  When I'm using it...it works then it stops, then I shake it and then it starts to work again, sometimes.  My last hair dryer lasted over 20 years.  They just don't make products like they use to. For this price I shouldn't expect much.   I guess you really do get what you pay for!  This hair dryer is perfect to take on an airline.   If it's not allowed on the plane and they throw it out,......who cares
This did not help my skin AT ALL. I would not reccomend it to anyone! Save your money!
Although it says that this works for ALL versions of Photoshop it does not upgrade from Photoshop Elements.  I spoke with customer service and they would not give me the code to unlock it
I just wanted to comment on some of the other reviews that are posted here.  Many try to sterotype the type of readers who like Real Simple, well I love this magazine- and didn't manage to fit into any of there categories.  My aunt sent me this magazine and then I began to read it monthly, I enjoy the tips and sections like "No time to clean?, quick solutions for every room"- yes they do have product suggestions, but much of the information that is provided can be done with things you already have.  Others have called this magazine- " a slave to fashion", as a woman in her 20's I would say this magazine is the one that contains minimal clothing information.  Overall I enjoy this magazine, as others have mentioned the recipes are great and I always find plenty of good tips.  The photography and layout are amazing, I always use the old editions for reference or crafts
Going by the Plantronics name I bought a pair of M60 headsets to use on a cell and a miniphone. They are incredibly cheaply made, and when my wife gave them a try she got a NASTY feedback squeal several times during a long call. Essentially unusable, unless we find some trick that we have missed so far. We ordered a Sennheiser PC120 to try instead
This has to be by far one of the best lip treatments on the market.  Pricy...yes.  But well worth every cent.  In as few as two uses my lips have gone from cracked to whole.  Tastes as good as it smells.  Lemon...brownsugar..like the body scrub of the same name.   --- My only complaint: it doesn't have the longevity of say Prada's lip balm (which I use when running)
I originally wanted the Orange colored Tsubos, but they were out of stock, so I decided to go with the pickle color. I absolutely love em! The comfort and style are unique and satisfying. It is because of shoes like this I have become a shoe expert of sorts
I love this mac & cheese.  It has all of the comfort food aspects of easy mac (warm and gooey, orange cheese) but without that vague chemical aftertaste.  It tastes so cheddar cheesey and is wonderful to keep on hand for those days when there is just NO food in the fridge (you don't even need to add milk to this!).  My favorite comfort food when I'm sick
If you are looking for this to be very accurate, then you need to use the lithium batteries.  Because of the cold temps here, the cheaper batteries do not work as well.  Maybe where it doesn't get in the minus temps, the Rayovac batteries will be okay, but not here in NE.  The sensor needs to be put in a location, that is out of the sun, and out of reach of your pets, and children.  Which makes for a little decision making time, on your part. 
I have to admit that good writing or not this is one of my favorite escape movies and I wish it would come out in DVD.  My liking it has something to do with John's use of the typewriter and his ability to change the  direction of the characters through the machine.  Once he damages the  typewriter he needs to make a technical sevice call to get it going again.   You can't beat that.  We even get to see a perplexed Robert Wagner and the  rest of a great cast
the bra cup itself is too big for my chest. and although interesting to look at because it looks like a bra women may have worn daily in the 30's and 40's it is not at all comfortable.  blah!  and i love vanity fair so its disappointing for sure
These are wonderfully crunchy and delicious. The calorie count is misleading, however! One piece is more than the 25 calories they claim it is. But it's worth it!
I was all set to do the typical 10 day antibiotic course for a sinus infection (I even had bought the antibiotics), but decided to try this first. It is very effective in clearing the sinuses, nose, throat and lungs. Couple things: ---  --- 1. It makes a minor mention of using a solution (if desired) in the tank provided. I used Vicks. It more than doubles the steam output. So even if you don't get a solution, use plain water. Without it, the output is not impressive. ---  --- 2. If you do get Vicks, get your magnifying glass out and read the dilution instructions. They do not make it clear without reading the fine print that it is a highly concentrated solution. If you add it undiluted, I think you'll go blind... ---  --- I highly recommend this unit
Made my skin smooth and very clean. I loved the minty smell. Will definitely buy it agai
We bought this clock to replace one of those cheap quartz wall clocks in our new (used) motorhome. I wanted it so that I would not have to wear a watch but would still have a dependable and accurate time piece.  ---  --- It took a couple of nights before the LaCrosse atomic clock received the signal to synch up, but after that it seems to be working exactly as advertised, accurate right to the second.  ---  --- This clock has a large protrudance on the back where the clock's works reside so the bezel does not sit flush to the wall. Either a large hole needs to be cut in the wall or you just have to live with it. No big deal, but it is something difficult to see from photos on the Internet. This is why I gave it 4 out of 5 stars
This is enough of an instrument to show you new things in the sky for years to come. It is sturdy and simple to operate. It has enough light-gathering power (more important than magnification) to reveal dim star clusters, nebulae, and galaxies and good enough optics to show you the surface of planets like Jupiter, Saturn, and Mars. ---  --- Some advice on selection. Dobsonians like this one come in a range of sizes. A 114mm (4 ½") is a bit on the small side but still a fine instrument, especially if your ability to carry large objects is limited. A 150-200mm (6-8") scope is right in the middle of the recommended range. A 250mm (10") like this one is on the big side, and you should buy one only if you are able-bodied. ---  --- Some advice on use. Viewing through a telescope is less like playing a CD and more like playing a guitar. Finding objects takes a little bit of practice. The 9x50mm "crosshair" finder supplied with this scope is great for fine searching, but I recommend supplementing it with a red-dot finder to aid in initial pointing. You will also need to buy an atlas (Sky & Telescope's Pocket sky Atlas is the best available), a red flashlight to view the charts without blowing out your badly-needed night vision, and a guidebook to lead you to interesting objects. These investments will greatly add to your enjoyment. ---  --- What more can I say? This is the kind of scope that experienced observers have been trying to steer novices towards for decades. Although, I recommend that you do your homework before buying any scope--learn the sky and get to know experienced stargazers who can advise you--when it comes time to purchase, you could hardly do better than this scope. ---  --- For more advice, see my encyclopedic guide here on Amazon, "So you want to buy a telescope.
...these are comfortable. You can actually forget you're wearing them. And if you are like me and worn just about every thong there is, that is huge. I was thinking I should just stop wearing thongs at all until I found these. I've washed my pair a couple times in the regular cycle and dried them, and it still is holding up well. I'm back on Amazon.com to buy more. Go for it girls, you won't regret it! Sexy and comfy. Could you ask for more... ---  --- I now own three pairs
Oral B has always been top notch for me and this 8900 DLX is just fantastic. ---  --- My teeth are so bad the Dentist always called me the plaque king  lol --- but after 6 months on this I went to the next cleaning and they saw a huge improvement. ---  --- He calls me by my name now thanks to this product haha  ---  --- I have been putting this thing to the test for about a year now and I love it...I keep it on the spinning setting which really works well. ---  --- do remember that if you turn it on without it in your mouth, you spray water everywhere and the spin setting really makes a fine mist with some power but its still a top notch product. ---  --- thanks Oral B!!
Boots run about a size too big and unfortunately it cost $20 to return/exchange
Clean and Crisp. Defined and Smooth. --- I use Burberry by Burberry for all occassions but it is great for the evening. IT has woodsy notes that remind me of autumn. --- I am very picky about my fragrances and I only use two regularly -- Eau d'Issey by Issey Miyake is my main scent, but I do use Burberry sometimes on occassion and I love it. Thats it
This is my second Norelco Wet Shaver. So, yes, I like the product. Here's my rundown: --- Pluses: ---   - Good shave ---   - Less razor burn ---   - lot easier to insert packets (compared to my older model) ---   - easy to clean --- Minuses: ---   - Hard to get that "patch" under your nose ---   - Have to switch out an add-on to get sideburns straight ---   - battery/power seem to wane at times ---   - packets are expensive --- I'm a cheap SOB, so here's my way of stretching out the life of the packets. Wet your face first with hot water, rinse your shaver with hot water and then squeeze out the lotion. Do a first pass shave. Rinse the shaver and do a second pass without the lotion with a wet face/shaver. Keep a blade on-hand to get the under-the-nose patch and your sideburns. ---  --- All-in-all doner likes
Even as dedicated of a Radiohead fan as I am, I really don't care much for this album. I say thank goodness for "Creep" because we may have never heard from them again (or at least not in the same way) if that song had not become as popular as it did
I am not one of those parents who have trouble getting my child in the bath, its getting him out that's the problem.  With the crayons he absolutely loves coloring on the walls in the tub the pallet was useless when he figured out that the tub was just one huge canvas. ---  --- Personally I think these are some of the best tub toys!  My suggestion is to just buy the crayons and forget the pallet.  You can also use them in the pool and if you have a vinyl siding house and your children have sprinkler, it also makes a great place to color.  Be careful to wash everything off before it dries.
I was a little skeptical about this program  - until I tried it last evening for the first time. I am really impressed.....  I did not even use the tutorial before I dove in and tried to play a bit.  I created a single room in less than 3 minutes, using simple walls, doors, windows, and a fireplace.  Adding flooring and coloured walls was so easy it was almost sinful!  LOL ---  --- I am most anxious to do more with the program and learn about all its capabilities.  Today I watched the tutorial and was really surprised at how much this program can do!   ---  --- I am entering into an interior design program in January 06 and wanted to "play" with the CAD software in advance.  I was really happy and impressed with the simplicity of the Better Homes and Gardens version as the idea of CAD seemed intimidating.  Not any more.... ---  --- I whole-heartedly recommend this program to everyone who is considering designing their interiors or for students of interior design who have not yet attempted any CAD programs. 
I have tried for years & years to get it. I still don't! This being the one Bergman film I seem never to get around to seeing, I made sure I saw it this time @ a Bergman retrospective @ my local art house theatre. Well @ least I sat thru it. During the show, no less than 5 people got up & just walked out. So I guess it's not just me! I personally found it to be mediocre at best. I don't get why folks think this is such an incredible film? The storyline is just so banal, as are the continuous close-ups of faces centered mid-screen. DATED TO SAY THE LEAST! I don't think it holds up-period! I have said it before & I still believe that if you want to see what Bergman was attempting thru-out his career, GO SEE "INTERIORS" BY WOODY ALLEN! He does Bergman BETTER THAN Bergman! And don't even get me started on Liv Ulman---ugh!!!!!
This exercise video was very easy to get started on and you could do all the exercises in very limited space.  This is great for people who do not have alot of room.  After exercising to the video, I felt really good, energized.  I would definitely recommend it to someone who is just starting out exercising. It is low impact and easy to follow
This is the 3 copy version of Norton  AV.  (one CD will create three copies) I purchased it to save money as it was less than $20 per copy.  I bought it to replace NAV 2006 on the same three computers which had expired. ---  --- Installed easily on two machines.  Just the uninstall of 2006 and the install of 2007.    ---  --- The first machine was more difficult.   There is evidently some conflicting software on the computer as i had to use msconfig for a "Clean boot" per Norton web site instructions .  I kept running into the "blue screen of death" on the previous installs when i would get to the actual install of the Norton AV.  Each time i would have to uninstall the program and do more.   But all of the help came from the Symantec (norton) website.  It is now working fine. ---  --- Added: --- My personal preference is to not use software firewalls.  I use a router with NAT as a hardware firewall. (It only blocks unauthorized incoming malware)  Software firewalls try to tell you about everything leaving your computer and generally you either become paranoid or just shut the thing off.   They are intended to look for malware by behavior.  Antivirus programs look for malware by signature.  The only advantage to finding malware by behavior is if the computer is attacked in the first day or two of the malware's existence.  If one has an antivirus program it will eventually (within a few days) find the problem that the software firewall was trying to tell someone about. (assuming they haven't given up yet with too many cries for wolf). --- So the only software firewall i have (Microsoft OS firewall) is turned off and thus i haven't had the same problem as others report.  ---  --- As a practice i sent junk email directly to the trash can and avoid weird websites.  So far no problems with malware.
I purchased this item on March 15 from Amazon. We've been using it for almost a month now. My wife and I have built our HT system in our Master bedroom (16x14x10) also have 40" Samsung LCD 4095 (1080p) and Polk audio speakers (in ceiling) LC60i for front and middle speakers and RC60i for the surround speakers. I'm awaiting for Toshiba HD-XA2 that was recently ordered to complement our system and would be replacing my current infinity  subwoofer with a HSU STF-2 sub. ---  --- Originally my first choice was a Pioneer VSX-1016 receiver but with lack of zone 2 and HDMI video pass-thru only. I didn't think it fit our needs. However, Onkyo TX-SR604b not only was a true bargain but it also exceeded my expectations, ease of use (very easy setup) user friendly powerful enough to drive all my polk speakers clean and crisp sound. I did'nt have any problem as far as clicking sound related to HDMI issues like few folks have mentioned on their reviews and I didn't mind running extra component cable to my TV knowing it doesn't up-convert component to HDMI. The only thing that I haven't tested it yet was the zone 2 feature. I'm planning to install my extra pair RC60i in wall speakers to our master bathroom hopefully soon so can't comment on that part yet. ---  --- Overall we're very pleased with our purchased Thanks AMAZON!
I would have never bought this stuff but a friend was making it one day and I tried some. It was sooo good.  --- I had always just made Craft* before this stuff but now I'd say I eat this just as much. It's a great way to change up the normal macaroni taste. And did I mention it's really good too. It's kinda salty tasting with a creamy white cheddar texture. My favorite is when you get a noodle full of undistributed cheese..MMMMM. I also love it because it's organic. With each day of my life I'd say i'm eating smarter and this product was the next step in my plan. I can't wait to try out the other flavors and different products. --- I'd like to see this being sold in Ralphs market soon. As of now I can only find it in Vons/Safeway
I was more than pleased when I received this pendant! It has a nice feel and you actually know it's there, instead of it feeling like a good wind would carry it away. You have to look extremely close to see the peridot in the setting, but that is all I have to complain about! Definitely worth your money
This is my third digital camera, I bought it after my tot dunked my previous camera under water.   I did a lot of research before I bought this and it was highly rated in Consumer Reports. ---  --- After a few months of ok pictures (the macro setting is not very good though) the lens cover started sticking but I learned to live with it.  I would manually open up the lens cover each time.  Then the lens cover got stuck in the open position and I was learning to live with that.   But now the camera is almost completely dead.  It will not power up properly and sometimes it beeps.  I'm not sure but I think I am out of the warranty period with this. ---  --- I will not buy another Canon Camera.  This camera was made too cheaply.  I wish things were not made to break right away
John Coltrane was villified most of his creative life for playing at the edge of a world he was helping to redefine. Wynton and the LCJO are in effect the death of creative musicians like Coltrane, or most of the truly creative Jazz scene for that matter. Wynton is establishing himself as "the face of Jazz". A market oriented phenomenon which freezes some of the elements making Jazz without ever capturing the true essence of the music. By telling us (and make no mistake, these guys do...): "this is what Jazz is" and trying to re-appropriate themselves the music of Jazz giants such as John Coltrane who, if he were alive, would not be given the time of day by these folks, Wynton and his posses are raping what is true and beautiful in this music.  --- The recording, since I must talk about it, features a set of crafty yet discomboluted arrangements merely mimicking what Coltrane was, mostly empty of content, setting in motions soloists who sound more like "Jazz puppets" than anything remotely close to what Coltrane was striving for (notable exception: Ted Nash !). --- You do NOT need this record. Wynton and the LCJO does NOT need your money; spend it on musicians who put their life and their art on the edge, the way Coltrane did
Got this camera in 1999 and it is still doing very well!  More than 3000 great pictures have been taken.  The camera is very easy to use and needs no maintenance.  A word of caution - ensure that the camera doesn't get pressurized laterally - this can happen if it is stuffed in a bag and someone sleeps over it.  The spring-operated shutter is very sensitive. ---  --- Would recommend this for anyone who is looking for a cost-effective and easy-to-use film camera
Many musicians release some sort of experimental album at some point in their career.  For Peter Gabriel, every album is an experiment.  Usually musicians experiment by deviating from the norm; however, on Gabriel's fifth experiment, SO, the ex-Genesis frontman does the exact opposite.  Gabriel, beloved for always doing something different, decided on this album to play it safe - and for Gabriel, that is an experiment.  Previously he was a sort of cult performer, but on SO, Gabriel finally made it into the spotlight.  Big time.  SO was an immense success, peaking at number one on the Billboard Top 100, receiving overwhelmingly-positive reviews (in 2003, So placed 187th on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time), and resulting in a sold-out tour. ---  --- Which brings us to one nagging term: "sellout". ---   --- Though most who loved Peter Gabriel's first four albums loved SO as well, there are still many who call SO Gabriel's sellout album.  To me, that's just foolishness.  Peter Gabriel has never "sold out" and I have no doubt that he never will.  It's clear that on SO he was trying to go in a more mainstream direction, but that's probably the biggest experiment Gabriel has ever undertaken, save for his subsequent release, PASSION.  One popular theory amongst Gabriel fans is that the album's title, SO, is in fact an acronym for "Sell Out" (hence the uppercase capital "S" and the lowercase italicized "o").  I wouldn't be surprised at all if it was. ---   --- SO does sound very different from Gabriel's earlier albums (though then again, none of those sounded alike either).  If anything, it resembles Gabriel's third self-titled release, nicknamed MELT.  The thing that really separates those two - other than an obviously more commercial sound on SO - is a feeling of warmth on that album, unlike the harsh, gritty darkness of MELT.  Perhaps that's why listeners found SO so charming. ---   --- What does SO have to offer?  Well, a lot.  For one thing, there's the atmospheric opening, "Red Rain", one of Gabriel's finest tracks.  Like many of the tracks on the album, it's dominated by ethereal guitar from David Rhodes and heavenly synthesizers, courtesy of Gabriel himself.  Then there's one of the biggest hits of 1980s (which also spawned what may be the best music video in history), "Sledgehammer," inspired by the motown music Gabriel listened to as a child.  With its pounding, industrial percussion, playful bass (by Gabriel's exclusive bass man, Tony Levin) and clever, sexually suggestive lyrics, it's no surprise that "Sledgehammer" was a hit.  After letting his silly side out, Gabriel tries to inspire with "Don't Give Up", a nice song made great by heavenly vocals from another popular 80s musician, Kate Bush. ---   --- The subsequent track, "That Voice Again", is my personal favorite song from this album.  It features some excellent drumming from Manu Katche, an immensely-talented drummer who has also played with artists like Sting, along with misty guitars, delightful synthesizers, and fine lyrics hit home by Gabriel's pained singing.  Like the best tracks on SO, "That Voice Again" manages to be fun, moody, uplifting, powerful, warm, and inspirational, all at once. ---   --- Gabriel winds down a little for the dreamy, powerful "Mercy Street", a song inspired by and written about Anne Sexton, an American mental patient who relieved her depression through writing.  As on his previous albums, Gabriel proves that he knows when to lighten up by whipping out "Big Time", a silly but fun track which also spawned an innovative music video.  "Big Time" features heavy drumming from Stewart Copeland, the former drummer of The Police, as well as some awesome CMI by Simon Clark.  "We Do What We're Told (Miligram's 37)" is about the experiments of Yale professor Stanley Milgram.  Milgram would have his subjects administer shocks to actors, who would scream in pain as the shocks became more and more horrible.  Milgram observed that his subjects would do what he told them to do, despite the immense pain they appeared to be inflicting on the actors.  He follows that rather cold song with "This Is The Picture (Excellent Birds)", a tensely surreal tune. ---   --- The album closes with one of Gabriel's most famous songs, "In Your Eyes".  Most people are familiar with the song from its usage in Cameron Crowe's romantic comedy masterpiece ... SAY ANYTHING, where the song was used in what has become one of the most famous scenes in movie history.  It's one of Gabriel's warmest and most romantic compositions, and also one of his best.  On the original LP version of SO, "We Do What We're Told" closed out the album.  That's a fine way to end it, but it's also a rather cold way to end such a warm album.  When the album was re-released remastered on CD in 2002, Gabriel placed "In Your Eyes" at the end of the album as he originally intended.  Now that is the way to end it! ---   --- So - how does SO rank among the many other brilliant works of Peter Gabriel?  Well, it ranks quite highly, actually.  It's one of the pinnacles of Gabriel's career, though whether it truly is the peak or not is hard to say.  After all, how can one compare Gabriel's albums when they are all so vastly different?  Certainly, though, SO is one of the finest Gabriel masterpieces.  This is fun, well-crafted, emotional music.  SO is SO wonderful.    
I agree with the other negative review below- Uninspired, simply forgettable radio trash.  Cliched lyrics?  Check.  Muddy, simple riffs?  Check.  Boring drumming with a couple of poorly played double bass kicks?  Check.   ---  --- Thank god I got this in a box of cd's from a DJ buddy of mine for free awhile back.  If I actually paid for this crap I'd have to kill myself.   ---  --- Judging from all the "positive" reviews however, it seems some people at Lava records or possibly the band themselves (if they're still around.  I hope not.) have been trying to plug this  sorry excuse for music. 
I like Meav's voice, and this CD is OK, if you like this kind of stuff. Think slow and somewhat depressing. I think Irish music has moved on so much since Bill Whehlan of Riverdance brought it into the modern times, and came up with this vocal sound, I guess to hark back to earlier times, which worked well because Riverdance has so much contrast in it and the choir songs only appear as relief to the other music. This is all a bit samey and dull. I would say saved by this lady's fine voice though
***** --- Tazo's China Green Tips Green Tea is a slightly stronger green tea than Tazo's Zen, and I liked that it doesn't contain Tazo's omnipresent "natural flavors" that almost all of their other teas contain, which to me is not an advantage. I like a natural, real taste with real ingredients sans vague "natural flavors" and sans flavorings, sans essences, etc. China Green Tips delivers this in a cleaner, purer way than Tazo's other teas. I liked this green tea! ---  --- The ingredients in China Green Tips are simply spring-harvested green teas from China. It contains caffeine. ---  --- Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, "The Reincarnation of Tea". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some "natural flavors" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague and unnecessary for a super premium tea. China Green Tips has none of these "natural flavors" and it shows in the quality and cleanliness of the tea experience. ---  --- On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, "a traditional Chinese green tea with a delicate fresh taste and a light green liquor." This is the perfect way to describe this tea! On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of China Green Tips as "grassy, vegetative, sweet, ricey". Tazo describes the aroma as "vegetative, popcorn".  ---  --- I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as very good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi or Aspen. Still, this tea is excellent, so I'm breaking my tradition with Tazo teas and giving it five stars. If you enjoy super premium teas, and are stuck with Tazo for some reason, choose China Green Tips and you will be quite satisfied. I can't honestly say that about any other Tazo tea. --- ****
This has to be Stephen King's worst work adapted. This adaptation is even worse than Needful Things. Children Of The Corn (I am talking about the original and not the crappy sequels) was miles abouve better than this garbage. Just a stupid movie adapted from a lame book. Just plain trash
TSN is an excellent sports magazine for the general sports fan. --- It covers nearly all the sports in and out of season, including NASCAR autoracing.  A sports fan will find something of interest in every issue.  I was able to find a free subscription which makes it ever better!  I would recommend it to any sportsfan who wants to read about his favorite teams or sport
This is one of the worst-written programming books I have seen yet.  I'm sorry I bought it.  It appears to be written by a man who knows quite a bit about finance, and dangerously little about C++ programming.  Duffy's review correctly describes the main flaws.   ---  --- I would add that (1) The book is not structured to build upon OO, GOF Patterns, or STL design principles; (2) The code does not follow even basic C++ coding conventions; (3) The images (screenshots) are agonizingly UNREADABLE; (4) The code listings are in ITALICS using a variable-pitch font [is COURIER font code listing so difficult to include in a $100 book???]; (5) No over-arching component object model is suggested ANYWHERE in the book. ---  --- Some of the efforts at brevity are just plain WRONG or even DANGEROUSLY WRONG to teach beginning programmers.  For example, Pg 19 Data Types section: ---  --- ---------------- --- int - holds integer numbers up to a little over 2 million, for example, "int I = 2000000;." --- long - same as int. --- ---------------- ---  --- WRONG, PROFESSOR!  This is not only a syntactically incorrect example, but a just plain wrong assertion.  If the reader does not know how to determine the (platform-specific) size of an "int" or "long", then the author has only served to confuse the matter further! ---  --- Furthermore, I consider it a "cheapskate" tactic to ask readers to pay for the code from this book in electronic form (particularly when the book's code listings are so sloppy).  That said, I would not use the code, even if it had been supplied for free ... but it *might* have been interesting to have something to play around with... ---  --- Have any of the reviewers actually USED any code from this book without substantial refactoring? ---  --- The only use I could see for this book is for intermediate-advanced fin-techs, who want to review a few general algorithms for selected derivative calculations (futures, forwards, etc) ... but just be prepared to squint and suffer through reading the code
NOTE: this product will only work on walls with wood studs.  No metal studs. ---  --- See the sanus website for installation manual and more details
I was that parent who said "I'll never spoil my child with a wipe warmer--it will only encourage her to wear diapers longer." And then I woke up and realized that warm wipes at night mean a baby who doesn't cry during changings and goes back to bed more easily--this could mean an extra half hour of sleep for me. I am now a big fan of the warmer. It works very quickly and doesn't dry them out, and the light is just bright enough to change the baby at night without waking her up. Definately a nice product.
This book was written in 1982, updated in 1995. It has a whole section on cameras, which isn't useful since most of them are outdated. Doesn't even mention digital cameras. Since it specifically discusses the mechanics of cameras, I found this book to be disappointing.
I know that i am at an FPO address so that makes it more difficult to send and receive parcels but, to have never gotten the parcel is unsatisfactory.  i never got the item that you wish me to make a review on.  Send it to me and I will gladly use it and then review it
I bought a couple of these bodysuits because I thought that they were quite amusing. The quality seems ok - I have not washed them yet so I can't comment on the color fastness - the dark blue seems a like it may fade.The first thing I noticed was that the bodysuits are very long. They are not the stardard length you get with Gerber and Carter's etc. The 0-3 mths has the length of a normal 6-9mth bodysuit. The chest area is ok but the armholes are a bit small. In the bigger sizes the armholes seem normal. I have to wait until my son gets here to decide if I will convert the smaller ones into tees.  --- This would have gotten 5 stars if the sizing was right - Hope this helps future buyers!!!
I really like this peel.  It is very easy to use and I have noticed a difference in my skin.  It is clearer and the redness and discoloration is fading.  I even noticed my clogged pores are diminishing.  I recommend this peel to anyone.  I have very sensitive skin and it did not cause irritation.  I use this one about twice a week. ---  --- I also recommend the microdelivery vitamin C peel.  That one I use once a week. ---  --- Jennife
Anyone who has ever played the original would know that the whole point of kingdom hearts is to beat the stuffing out of the heartless with nifty weapons known as keyblades,  Well, this time around you get to beat the stuffing out of heartless and a new brand of villan known as nobody's.  With a compelling story line and great voice acting, donald and goofy act and sound just like their dsney versions, kingdom hearts 2 delivers in every aspect of gameplay except for one, the summons.  I love this game, don't get me wrong, but i felt that they really could have added a couple of more summons into the mix to make the battle system that much more fun, the original had roughly 7 summons all together and this one has only 4.  Square, how about adding a couple of final fantasy summons, into the gameplay?  *cough, cough* BEHEMUT!  Either way this is a great game, one that any final fantasy or disney fan should pick up
This is a great house,got it at toysrus,has six ring tones at doorbell,dog,knock knock,jibberish,fog horn,etc.,it's so easy to assemble.all you need is a helper(to enjoy assembly)and a power or ratchet screwdriver(you need both)the stove is a little tricky to start but once you start the hole you can use a power drill!your child will love it.Swinging door/window,spongebob chair fits inside(you can probably get a big screen TV in there!)Great for the price $129.0
I bought this DVD set at a warehouse store yesterday and I've just finished the first workout.  There are some familiar moves from the original TAE-BO tapes, but these exercises are much more challenging.  The 'Billy Bands' add resistance to the basic moves.  This allows you to get a strength, cardio and flexibility workout in one.   The choreography is really simple so that even the least co-ordinated people should be able to stay in step.  This is a very challenging workout, and might be a little difficult for people who are not in shape.  If you are moderately fit, you'll find this workout to be fun and very motivating. According to my heart rate monitor, this workout burned a little less than 700 calories, so it will be a great substitute for a jog when the Seattle rain hampers my enthusiasm to exercise outdoors.
We ordered this case/auto mount for our Philips PET710 7" Widescreen Portable DVD Player because it was the one recommended by Amazon.  I needed the auto mount for long car rides with my toddler.  I eventually got this thing to work (failure was not an option if you get my drift), but it has a number of drawbacks. ---  --- -In order to mount it, you have to remove the top half(huh?).  Having two parts makes it harder to install and easier to lose.  I accidentally left the top part on the top of the car when I drove away. ---  --- -It's too small.  The Philips portable DVD player is too long for the case and the headphones and car/ac converters also pull the player out of the case.  Plus (and this is really amazing), it does not have enough space to hold the most basic accessories that came with the DVD player.  I have to carry the headphones and sleaved DVDs seperately! ---  --- I chose my last DVD player b/c it came with an auto mount case, and even though I like the Philips DVD player, I'd do that again if I had it to do over.  Having the right case/mount for your DVD player is that key
BEWARE!!! DESPITE THE PICTURE AND THE PRODUCT DESCRIPTION, THIS IS NOT A FOUNTAIN PEN.  IT IS INDEED A BALLPOINT PEN AS THE PRODUCT TITLE INDICATES
The kids got it for Christmas, and it looked like fun.  However, the one we got doesn't work at all.  I'm not sure if we just got a bad one or if this problem is common, but I can't even get it to turn on without changing the batteries, and then I can't get it to go into the game mode.  Plus, the rules of the electronic version are different, in that you lose all your points if you keep acting out words.  I prefer the rules of the old version better.  I'm planning to return this and get the old version
I recently bought a new Celestron Nexstar 4SE telescope and this eyepiece accessory kit.  Much to my disappointment, the eyepieces in this kit did not fit very well into the eyepiece holder of the telescope, and when cold (nights in Colorado are 25-45F), the eyepieces did not fit at all.   ---  --- Celestron customer service was horrible and did not pay attention to my problem and did not follow up by email as promised.  When I called a second time, they had no clue about the construction of the eyepieces and no thoughts about how to fix this problem.  Amazon replaced the kit (Thank you Amazon!), but the replacements did not fit either.  I'm returning that kit too.  I finally bought a kit from Meade (3 eyepieces and a moon filter) that fit properly and are very easy to use.   ---  --- To be fair, if these eyepieces fit your telescope then they are a tremendous value (hence the rating of 2 stars rather than 1).  The Meade kit is a worse value, but because they work in my nice new scope, they are the best for anyone using a Nexstar 4SE
Easy to use in the configurations shown. However, 3 million candlepower doesn't do you much good when the battery needs recharging after no more than 15 - 20 minutes of use
This is just a great CD. Whenever I need to restore inner harmony after work, or dealing with any upsetting situation, this is the one I go to. Instantly I am transported to the calm, soothing setting of a traditional Japanese house and garden. It is fantastic for meditation, too. Let all the nonessentials of life slip away while you listen to this beautiful recording
When I considered purchasing this product, I was confused to see that some people thought it was great, and others thought it was terrible.  I couldn't understand why there were such discrepancies in the reviews. ---  --- After I bought it I understood: For some of the things it does, it works fine -- no problems.  However, there are many major bugs in the software, and if you need one of the buggy functions, you'll be sorry you bought it. ---  --- Examples of some problems:  ---  --- 1. If you burn an audio track entitled "Blue Fog" Nero will give it the title "Fog." ---  --- 2. Every time I run a backup, it tells me there was a write error, but the backup seems OK. ---  --- 3. I backed up every file on my drive, but when my system crashed, there were problems that prevented me from restoring my system. ---  --- 4. It has blue screened my system one time. ---  --- 5. Many commands are poorly or not at all documented.  For example, the wave editor has a declipper function, but there is no documentation on how to use it. ---  --- So, I'd recommend that you look instead at a competing product. ---  --- Good luck
After a very positive review by a popular consumer magazine, I purchased this scale. On the unit I received, the upper weight range appears to be overstated by some 20 lbs.  ---  --- The scale I was previously using and the one in my doctors office clearly have my weight below the 300 lb limit. I have been lifting weights and somewhat discouraged by the scale alone. I wanted to see if I was having an impact on body fat so I purchased this scale.  ---  --- When I attempt to use this scale, it errors out with the OL code. Perhaps the magazine should retract another article
I love this shade! I am the mother of 2 girls, Alice 7 and Samantha 22 months. I never had anything like this for my oldest. It makes such a difference. The little one won't go out without it! Even though I always used Sunblock on Alice, her skin is still so much darker than Samantha's; I really believe it is because of the shade. I looked into a lot of other brands before choosing this one and I think it is the best one on the market. The others are made from Nylon/Lycra and I don't think that would hold up as well as this one does. Thank you Protect a bub
I have been using Kiss My Face olive oil soap for years, and I won't let any other soap touch my face! I found it when I was searching for a soap that wouldn't make my skin itch all over after a shower. I can tell you that after years and years, my sensitive skin has never once itched after I used KMF! ---  --- The soap is mild, with a neutral scent, which is a big plus. It cleans great, but doesn't leave my skin dried out. The 8 ounce bars are a bit large, but worth the wait until they shrink down to a size that's easier for us smaller-hands people
I work at a nursing home for the elderly and travel my entire lunch break to take my kindergardener to daycare after school and then pick him up with my two year old to go home, and to know that I have this product at my beck and call. WOW!! I am a owner of this product for 6 months now and I all I can say is I love it.. So what is requires special water a gallon lasts me for two months so I don't mind spending $.75 every two months. I use it in conjunction with my pore cleanser from Panasonic and I now I use less make up than ever. I normally wear foundation, pressed powder and loose. Now it is just pressed powder. It allows my natural glow to come out and minimized my pores. I do my facial with a towel over my head to intensify the treatment along with a favorite cd and I am on a fifteen minute vacation without leaving home.  I take the towel  off and my pores are ready for the final stage. I turn on the cool mist and apply a moisturizer at the last minute and I am ready to face another day.
I remember buying a record by DNA when it first came out...and I was really surprised later when arto lindsay and the ambitious lovers were able to turn this mess into great music. This is very unprofessiona
This item is very excellent. I was suprise it does not comes with 2 screen protector only, but also a squeegeem, cloth and cleaning instructions. This shield fits very nicely over my phone screen
We were thrilled to find an online source for wagashi mochi desserts. We love Japanese desserts but because we don't live in New York or California we have a very hard time getting our hands on any. So when we found these we ordered right away. They arrived promptly and well packaged and tasted absolutely wonderful. Though a bit pricy after adding the speedy shipping they really were wonderful. It's not too hard to make plain old daifuku but when you crave the fancier stuff this is the way to go. --- 
My daughter's school requires that they where white knee highs with their uniform.  I had an awful time searching the net to find any until I came across these.  They are very soft and comfortable.  My daughter only wants these types of socks from now on.  But from a Mom's point of view they are hard to keep white.  Even with soaking in bleach I can't get out any of the foot wear and tear discoloring.  Other than that, they're great
My girlfriend made me buy this video after a night of dancing at the local club. All I can say is that the way Marlon builds steps made it easy for someone who has no coordination like me. Looking forward to getting part II next
I have been looking for a particular song for several years.  This album had it
Earrings are pretty, but look cheap and very flimsy.  I know they are supposed to be delicate, but they are not what they appear to be from the picture
Grisham's worst book by far.  90% of the story is preaching to the reader that homeless people just have bad luck and are good guys.  It would be ok if that was woven into a good story, but it is not.  ---  --- For great Grisham read The Firm and The Partner.  For very good, read Runaway Jury and Pelican Brief.  All of these are page turners. ---  --- Street Lawyer is a stomache turner.  Really bad.  What happened
After one successful printing it didn't work at all. My printer is HP deskjet 712C. This cable seemed to be recognized correctly at first but kept from being connected
This cover is great, it provides a buffer from scratches and absorbs some of the trauma to the phone if dropped. It isn't soft leather so if you want to protect your RAZR you might want to consider a shield
This straight-to-video's modest budget is attested to by the fact that while most of the action is supposed to take place at a large state prison, this prison only seems to house about 12 inmates. The plot is that old but reliable one about a man posing as a prisoner so he can go "undercover" and solve a crime. The crime in this case is not especially interesting and it's resolved in much too pat a fashion. However, leading man Tommy Lee Thomas looks good with his shirt off, (though he seems too small to be throwing his weight around), and there's a torture scene, (modeled on the one in "Lethal Weapon"), in which he's hanged by his wrists and zapped with electric shocks. Mr. Thomas' performance may not be of Oscar caliber but he does know how to yell. 
A very enjoyable retelling of Shakespeare's "Romeo and Juliet". "Valley Girl" may be an extremely outdated movie, but it still makes me laugh
Like other users, I found the light output substandard. I bought it specifically as an emergency light source. If I really needed this light, there really would be an emergency! Absolutely pathetic
This is not a rating of the magazine - just a warning to check your Wish List address if you "wish" for magazines. ---  --- My son changed his address in his Amazon account when he moved 2 years ago within the same city. Amazon did not use this information to update his address within his Wish List. When I ordered $138 worth of magazines from his wish list last December, Amazon hid the street address "for privacy" - therefore I could not know the magazines would be sent to the wrong address. ---  --- In November, I asked my son if he'd like to have these magazines renewed and he said he had never received any! ---  --- After I spoke with Amazon, my son now gets a message when he goes to his Wish List that his address doesn't match the one in his account, so it's clear Amazon is now aware of this problem. ---  --- The publisher will not redo this Communication Arts subscription, saying the magazines were never returned to them, and Amazon has not responded to my request for a refund
I originally found these Flatbread crackers while traveling.  After returning home I longed for them, so Amazon came to the rescue with a source of these great flatbreads
Our kids loved this - so much so that when one dropped it and broke the plastic strip by the on/off button (making the toy unusable), I bought another one.  Wouldn't you know the same thing happened a few weeks later?  This toy is supposed to be made for small children who have been known to drop things on occasion...the manufacturer needs to correct this problem
This was the worst purchase I've ever made in my crusade against the ants and spiders that have taken over my home!  I have MORE pests now than I did before.  Actually had ants crawling on one of the repeller units.  If you're thinking about buying this product... DON'T waste your money.  You'd be better off with a couple of cans of Raid
Typical of the war movies of that age.  Very much the Americans are all good clean kids who will overcome injustice.  I enjoyed looking at an America that was.  Would purchase again but this is not a documentary or even a close approximation of real life
The Mokeskine notebooks are must haves for art majors. They're handy for quick sketches, laying out ideas for 2D/3D design class, keeping track of glazing formulas, class assignments, personal notes and reminders, email addresses and phone numbers, just about anything you can think of to draw or write down. The smaller ones fit in a pocket or small purse and the larger ones go nicely in your portfolio or backpack.
I have been a subscriber to TIME for over 15 years and before that a reader of my parents' subscription. It pains me to say that this magazine has forgotten what it is about. Frankly, the only issues worth their salt are those resulting from a major world event such as a natural disaster or a terror attack; such events seem to energize an otherwise listless staff of seemingly bored editors and newswriters. ---  --- A newsweekly has the obligation to go beyond the newspapers--to use the extra couple days to provide a more balanced and analytical view. Unfortunately TIME fixes its editorial position at the beginning of a story--any future coverage is designed to prove TIME's initial position correct. The immediate taking of an editorial position is then carried into all future coverage of the event; stifling analysis and preventing any analytical development beyond the first few stories--"we told you so, we told you so." Even worse, the coverage of a lengthy story peters out until something sensational happens at which point the sensational event becomes the ultimate interpretation of the entire story. Can't the magazine occasionally admit it was wrong rather than turning its eye away from the story that continues to burn? Out of sight, out of mind is the mantra... ---  --- In fact, I sometimes debate whether the decline of this magazine mirrors or outpaces the general decline in our media; newspapers are failing, television news can't seem to get away from the gory or sensationalistic, even academic journals have specialized themselves into irrelevance. We seem to have a greater appreciation for comedy than analysis. ---  --- Neutrality is dead. Frankly, I don't care so much about any perceived editorial slant as I do about the fact that the magazine is increasingly boring and irrelevant. TIME used to have excellent coverage of trends and events outside of the United States--no more. Iran is building nuclear weapons but merits the occasional blurb on a world summary page. African states are making vast strides towards democracy, we get an article about Nigerian computer fraud. Russia is emerging from the turmoil of perestroika and its painful transition has much to teach about the costs and value of democracy, but we seem to focus only on the latest roadbomb in Iraq. Japan, one of the world's most influential cultures, in the week I originally wrote this review (see 12-month subscription) merited only a snippet regarding a royal marriage and an analysis of foreign intrusion into sumo wrestling. Somewhere in the wide world is a fascinating place or culture to which TIME could send a correspondent and bring the place and people alive to its readership, instead we get tabloid excrement in the nature of Joel Stein's puerile take on pornography and social deviants. But most damning is the fact that after reading TIME one asks: How in the hell did our world become boring? ---  --- Can TIME try emulating The Economist rather than The Enquirer? Someone needs to step in and restore the proud tradition of complete and in-depth coverage--educate the reader about the world in which we live; don't wait until either natural disasters or internal politics shine the spotlight on any of the various cultures and countries in which real and interesting events take place every single week. TIME has the history and potential of being a five-star magazine, if only it would just focus on finding and reporting the news
Great Scent and the Body wash and the Sparkling Lotion alone is well worth the asking price. I brought the same item inside of my local mall for twice what I am going to pay here and I never even had to leave the comfort of my own home. --- Thanks for the dea
This bok was very boring i found it hard to stay awa
Received as a Christmas present, dead by February 24.  Well, actually, that's two months.  Now all it does is flash an error message, and nothing I do gets it out of that mode. ---  --- I liked it before it died on me
Love these.  I use them everywhere.  I really can't imagine not having them, since my son throws down all plates and napkins still. 
I bought these in black and got a ton of compliments as soon as i started wearing them... however I recommend you wear these with sheer stockings or something because they gave me a blister the size of Mt. Everest, ouch
Body Max is a very tough DVD.  I didn't find the step choreography too difficult to learn, but some of the combos were a bit quick and advanced.  I do recommend watching the cardio before attempting, or you'll be rewinding quite a bit like I did.  Cathe's cuing is great, especially while teaching the combo. ---  --- The complete workout is long and tough, but completely worth it.  If you don't have enough time, there are several premixes that have shorter lengths.  The premixes may be shorter, but they're no less intense
DENNIS LEARY IS HAILED AS SOME GREAT ANGRY YOUNG MAN WHO IS TRYING TO BRING THE WORLD TO RIGHTS. PERSONALLY I PREFER BILL HICKS. AT LEAST WHEN BILL DID IT HE WAS BEING ORIGINAL!!!!!!! DENNIS LEARY HAS IN MY OPINION NICKED BILL HICKS ACT IN A SIMILAR WAY TO HOW I FEEL ABOUT JOSS STONE COMPARED TO PROPER SOUL ARTISTS. SITTING IN FRONT OF A FEW LIVE VIDEOS OF A GREAT MAN AND TAKING NOTES DOES NOT MEAN YOU WILL EVER BE ONE DENNIS! --- DEFINATELY A MUST HAVE FOR ANYONE WHO ENJOYS COVERS BANDS...STICK TO THE ACTING DENNIS
Just make sure you buy the right drive for your computer and download the software from Western Digitals website you should have no problems. --- Very nice
Jeez, maybe I am getting old, but I really found absolutely nothing about this film to be interesting or original in the slightest.   ---  --- A brilliant scientist.  Disfigured.  Angry.  Finds temporary techie fix for face.  Goes to get bad guys.  Fighting.  More fighting.  Still more fighting.  Ex mate learns he's alive.  He leaves her anyway (he's too ugly).  The end.  More to come, if successful.  Not recommended
Yo Gotti in the past can spit some raw ish but on this one, I dunno what happpened.....The production seemed too generic, the rapping was pretty average and generic and not that impressive at all, and doesnt carry much replay value....To be honest, id pop in a Three 6  Mafia cd rather than this one....Album was slacking on so many levels, now theres some tracks that listenable, but the rest make it hard to enjoy this album, nothin special bout it at all...This album waz overhyped I believe and flopped horribly.......Gotti can do much better than this.....Wouldnt recommend anyone to chek it out..... ---  --- 2.5/
Rockin' Red Guitar, eh? Perhaps rockin' should ready "rocky," as the plastic case is easily broken by any youngster... or oldster, for that matter. Additionally, this "toy" comes pre-stringed with some form of non-natural strings, supposedly nylon -- two of these non-gut strings broke when attempting to ellicit some music from the item. Definitely not for a young child! It probably wouldn't last for a half-hour under constant use by smaller folk
The earings look much better than pictured online. --- I received this as a gift and love them
This tribute was announced almost ten years ago, and it seems to have undergone a transformation since then.  To be fair, there are some interesting additions such as the Sufjan Stevens and Brad Mehldau tracks.  And Emmylou Harris is brilliant.  But Sarah McLachlan's "Blue" has been heard before as has Prince's "A Case of You."  Earlier reports indicated contributions from heaviweights like Steely Dan and Lindsey Buckingham.  I sure would like to have heard what they would have done.  Even more disappointing is that Joni's Hejira-Mingus era albums are mostly ignored - and that was her best music, in my opinion.  As a final indignity, it sounds to me that too much compression was added in the mastering phase, and hence the overall sound quality of the CD is lacking in dynamics.
I've always loved these little cherries. Haribo has just the right flavor and texture. Buy in bulk - save a lot
considering the price this camera works great, I use it for taking family pics and is wonderful. What I dont like is the lack of zoom ---  --- Great product anyway --- 
While this book is a good reminder to high school students and their parents of the kinds of illiberal attitudes extant on many college campuses, I cannot recommend it to other readers. The author unfortunately perpetuates the right-wing-Republican-only stereotype believed by many outside evangelical Christianity. She battles as much for her political leanings away from gun control and in favor of all Bush administration policies as she does for the truth claims of the gospel. Indeed, in reading some of the chapters, it is difficult to see that she has any concept of a Christian worldview that might veer in any part from Republican platform positions. This is really too bad, because she makes many good points and appears to be courageous in her positions. I would not have begrudged her political point of view at all, had she made a clearer distinction between that and her theological position
This cd is the funniest cd i own.  The first half of the cd is pure comedy and super funny.  The second half is a little hard to understand, and it louds like is was recorded poorly, that is why i gave it four stars.  Track 2 is worth the money spent on the cd because that track is 8 mins of pure comedy.  Eddie makes fun of Stevie Wonder and boxer Larry Holmes, and he does it well
I bought this product no long ago.  It never works.  Mice still jump around, and even make noise.  I call the company.  They don't have technical report.  The product manual says, once mice get used to the ultrasound, it will not work.  I never heard about this from other company.  This company is very bad.    
Accurate and easy to use--just push the button amd insert. Better for grilling than oven work.A bit bigger than I would like but not too long-maybe a foot-and it does keep your hand safely away from splattering oil. Very accurate and sturdy.The on and off label has come unglued on mine so I need to reglue it
My 2 year old and 4 year old love this playdoh set.  I recommend it highly
I bought this hood after reading elsewhere that it fits the 50mm f/1.8 Mark I (the version with the metal mount and distance scale) that I purchased recently.  Canon specs the discontinued ES-65 hood for this lens.  The great thing about this ET-65III is that it is longer, so it blocks more stray light without vignetting on full-frame or 1/6-frame slrs.  The interior on this mark III version is also flocked, providing a bit more light absorption. ---  --- I've used those collapsible rubber hoods before while in college, but this hood is definitely worth the investment:  well built, fits backward on the lens for storage (but too long while the lens is on the camera), and provides good protection for the front of the lens (it's quite deep). ---  --- Note that this will NOT fit the newer 50mm f/1.8 Mark II version (all plastic mount with no distance scale)
You have to wear a thick pair of socks in order for the slipper socks to fit  properly.  They only fit properly for one wearing, stretch all out of shape until you wash and dry.  I have fleece socks from llbean which are wonderful and thought I would try these. "You get what you pay for" applies to this product
I read the book and saw the movie, which other than title and major characters, have little in common.  I can't say I really liked either.  The book is a little funnier. My major learning from the whole project was when "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" taught me about "roman a clefs", of which "Devil" is one.  Perhaps if I had more interest in the fashion industry, I'd have been more fascinated by the inside look that "Devil" provides.  Meryl Streep is very good as the apparently soulless Miranda Priestly, editor-in-chief of Runway magazine, but somehow she's never quite devil enough.  Anne Hathaway is passable in her second (or third) "made over princess" role.  The minor characters, including the wonderful Tracie Thoms as "best friend" Lily, are mostly wasted. 
We received the wipe warmer as a gift and our baby was happy with the warm wipes... that is... until I lifted the unit up and found that it had damaged the wood changing table it was on because water leaks from the bottom.  Upon further inspection I noticed that the bottom wipes were all burnt and brown even though I had filled it up at least once a day.  It seems that all the water going in was subsequently coming out the bottom.  Originally I had thought that perhaps I had a defective model, but after searching online, I noticed that a vast number of parents had the same experience we had, and now have decided to buy a different brand.  I did keep the water filled, and still had a poor experience.  Save your money and invest in a different brand
The description of this product on the Amazon site does not match what I received. Like another reviewer mentioned, the product was actually shipped from the UK so it took longer, and several features listed as being in the product are not there, specifically, exporting/saving of loops is not allowed, and there is no library of 1000+ loops included either. It seems to me to be basically like a demo version. Also, even though it was advertised as being new in the box, all I got was what looks like a (used) CD with no manual or CD key - so much for upgrading later! I am returning it. The SKU should be removed from amazon or the description should be changed to fit what is actually being sent out
This is a good product for the price. My only concern is when changing batteries the adhesive tape might be useless and must be replaced. I recomend it for use in the closed or in the kitchen under cabinet
I was quite unsure on whether to buy the film or not as i didn't think it was going to be my type of film. But i bought the game anyway although i hadnt yet seen the film. Anyway im glad i did! It only took me two days to complete but although it isnt long long, it is very good from beginning to end, basically going round different rooms of the house doing different things which may seem borin, actually it is really fun! The activites etc are great! it is definately a good game if you like the more adventurous games that arent too hard, like me, too hard games arent really my type! Now i so cant wait to see the film which i recently bought
I have wide feet and getting comfortable shoes expecially dress shoes has been a problem for me.  Once again LifeStride does know the meaning of wide shoe sizes.  It fits me very well, looks great, and is comfortable.  The color, Wild Rice is a medium dark tan and is as shown. I do recommend the shoe, and of course it is available in other widths-so it is not just for wide feet
If you were hoping for a skin flick, this is not it.  A couple of minutes of long shots of the young girls swimming topless and one real nice look at Julie McCullouh (...), in bed, is not enough too qualify.  The acting is awful.  Angie looks great for her age.  Still not enough
The Joy is an elegant addition to Lamy's well-designed line of affordable, functional fountain pens.  I'm a big fan of Lamy's Safari for everyday writing and have been using one for years (see separate review).  The Joy is the longer, pointy-ended, calligraphic cousin of the Safari, which is also a plastic fountain pen with windows on the side.  In fact, the caps are interchangeable, and the threading joining the front and back halves of the pen is the same, so I normally write with a Joy nib section screwed into a Safari back end, since I don't like the Joy's long end section for everyday writing and carrying in my bag or pocket.  Aesthetically speaking, I like the long, tapered design of the end, which reminds me of the dip pens I used to use for art and calligraphy.  While this design is fine for a pen that lives on a desk, it's a little too long for carrying around the campus or office.  That being said, I consider this a matter of taste than a problem with the design. ---  --- Like the Safari, the pen nib is durable and writes pretty smoothly and consistently...easily the best of the various pens I've tried in this lowest price range.  It's a light pen with a relatively narrow, molded grip section, so stay away if you would rather write with a hefty, chunky pen. ---  --- The 1.1 mm straight chisel nib is perfect for me.  I'm a lefty, so most oblique nibs won't work.  The chisel nib is just wide enough to give my otherwise ordinary handwriting a pleasant, calligraphic and more substantial quality.  (With the right inkn and paper combination, you get beautiful variation in tone and darkness in your strokes as the ink dries.)  However, it's not so wide that I can't write with it every day, unless I need to write really small.  I write letters, take notes on standard lined paper, address envelopes, fill out forms, sign checks, etc. with this pen without worry. ---  --- As an everyday user of fountain pens, I can say I really enjoy writing with this pen and the Safari, both.  However, I only dabble in calligraphy and cannot speak for this pen's appropriateness for someone who does that sort of work more seriously.  I expect this would be a good starter pen, however, for a beginning calligrapher...possibly one of the wider nib versions, if they don't expect to use it for everyday writing or fine (as in small) calligraphy work. ---  --- p.s.  If you like a more serious, industrial look, Lamy makes a version of this pen in black plastic and aluminum
 --- First off, IGNORE Renee's rating, this woman has ISSUES!!!!!! ---  --- This toothbrush works great! Would Highly recommend.
These ropes are great for double dutch. They're very fast and long so you can do two people at a time. I love double dutch. It is a lot easier with these ropes
The government won't let us get the real thing from Scotland, so this is the next best thing. Doesn't taste like canned Haggis from Scotland but no-one at our Burn's night party knows that
 Kama Sutra Massage Oil in the 8oz bottle is really good stuff! --- Keeps the skin so smooth and the girlfriend happy LoL just make sure you warm it up alittle before squirting it on. You will live longer
It's what I will need if the car battery is drained.  I hope I never have to use it
It helped me place myself in the right direction as far as choosing a college. It's hard to choose colleges just by what you hear by older people but this book is extremely useful in information you need to know before  visitng a college. I would reccomand this book. The software was useful to  me, however if you know how to write a formal essay it's no big deal
Seitenbacher is a fabulous soup mix! One canister makes 40 cups of broth, which makes it incredibly inexpensive. It's also delicious. It makes a truly versatile soup base. People love my nabeyakiudon (Japanese noodle soup), matzoah ball soup (Jewish dumpling soup), golden lentil stew (Indian bean stew), all of which have Seitenbacher as the base. It works for people with allergies and food sensitivities (no gluten, no lactose, no MSG, no soy). It's all natural and vegetarian (no gelatin). And I can't emphasize enough the rich, deep flavor.  
This device is made without varistors, which are burned up as they block transients and surges in power lines. Our AV system and HDTV are connected to it,  It has worked perfectly for the several months we have used it, blocking spikes in the power lines to expensive AV equipment
My baby loves it. by the way it is bigger than it looks on picture. I was afraid that it would be too small for my 12lb baby but it fits her perfect.
This high chair is a lot smaller than the photograph implies.  When screwing together the sections, I managed to split the wooden bar that would be the foot rest.  Any half decent person with a jigsaw would be able to make a more sturdy toy.  This toy is very basic, the seat of the highchair is wooden with a skimpy section of cloth.  Invest in some power tools and make your own, I guarantee it would be better than this one
While there are some flashes of brilliance in this album, it is compromised by a lack of direction. The 'Tastes so Sweet' mix of Rapture is beautiful, although cut far too short. Faithless, Afrika Bambaataa & Soulsonic, and Crystal Method are all good driving tracks at the tail end of this album. The high point, without contest, is Darude's ripping mix of Rising Star's 'Touch Me'. This is a cut to throw on for the peak... when you find the party is just outside of Barstow with Hunter. That said, then there are all the uninspired tracks in the center of the album. These are more appropriate in an adolescent Brit girl's drawer next to the Spice Girls. For some labels, this would be normal, for Ministry however, it is a dissapointment
I bought three DVDs(The Wood was one of them)and the DVDs were in European codes which means they won't play in the United States unless you own a "special" DVD player.  I'm very unhappy with my purchase.  My recommendation to you is that you read every single piece of information before you purchase movies that were formatted for another country.  This is the catch when you buy movies at cheaper prices
I have been a subscriber to CGW for almost 10 years.  Sadly, I have to end the subscription now.  It was a very good magazine; but no more.  One reason is that more than half of the magazine are now ads.  The second reason is that the size of the magazine is getting smaller and smaller with the layout that is getting very hard to read.  And the reviews are bad. The reviews don't have a professional kind of feel anymore.  I can't totally blame the magazine. A big part is due to the gaming industry.  There is no good game anymore.  They are all FPS and MMORPG.  Just how many time you can review the same type of games? ---  --- One positive thing about CGW is that it now comes with a DVD full of demo.  I think the DVD alone is worth the subscription.  But for me, it is done
It does work/live with DSL installed on the same line, ever heard of DSL filters? Too small? are you kidding? this phone is great all around
Poor communication.  I was notified that the printer was not coming when they said it would, but was never given another date.  After waiting some time I cancelled the order and said I ordered another one from someone else.  I guess they don't read their email either.  The next day they shipped the item.  Now I have two, but am not going to spend another $20 to ship it back to them.  Believe me I would never buy from this company again
I wouldn't describe this jerky as shredded but instead as powdered. It's not something you can tap into your hand and eat like a snack. The best use we found was to pour one of the little tubes onto a salad for added protein. Still, it had a fairly short shelf life for jerky; the unopened tubes had gone bad (mold? or something? ick) within about 3 months
I have used Quickbooks Basic for a number of years both in my church and for my business.  I have kept QB 2004 Basic since the upgrades were not immediately necessary for me. ---  --- I chose to upgrade this year to keep current on maintenance, etc. so again I chose the most basic product offered - "Simple Start".  I received it just fine and it installed perfectly. ---  --- However, it does not upgrade any previous QB files.  As I investigated, Intuit says that it won't upgrade files from previous QB versions on their web site (albeit in small print) and on the product box itself, but that was not ever mentioned in the Amazon listing. ---  --- So then I had to upgrade to the next higher version - an additional $80.  QB Pro also works very well; it's just a shame that Intuit insists on misleading customers by not providing full information through all marketing channels.  The Intuit phone rep also tried to overcharge me $20 for the upgrade but quickly accepted the correct amount when I pointed out their error a second time.
I have gone through 3 of these straighteners (i know, you think I would have learned!) however, my first one was lost, my second one stopped working in a matter of months, and the third one stop working in less than a month!! I purchased the third one (despite what happened with the second one I had bought) because it was an affordable price, I liked the size, and when the second one I had did work it worked well. Unfortunately in a matter of a few weeks one of the plates burned out so only one side works (causing obvious problems). I would recommend the sedu it has gotten great reviews and is more expensive, but I think when it comes to straighteners you get what you pay for
Many, many years ago when I was a very young woman, I saw my first Carry On movie and went to see every one I could possibly get to.  Then, there were none.  Several years ago, my sister taped a copy of Carry On Cleo for me. I couldn't believe I still roared at the silliness only the Brits can successfully pull off.  It must have been fate that led me to look up "Carry On" on amazon a few months ago.  My heart skipped a beat when The Carry On Collection came up.  I instantly made it mine and have watched most movies several times.  My personal favorites:  Carry On Constable, Carry On Cowboy, and Carry On Cabby.  But they are all good.  I've loaned several movies to a Brit here in the office who has seen all 27-something of the Carry On series and who is now introducing them to his American family.  They love them, too.  If you love double-entendre done to perfection, don't miss this collection
My daughter had this when she was a teenager. Now my grandchildren come and play the game she had. To preserve the original game I ordered new ones to replace my daughters game when she had it. The grandchildren, all 6 of them, love playing this game at our house
Sounds like a pitch but something about benefits sharpeners has obviously been designed better to sharpen without the usual amount of waste. These are all I can use anymore.
I though it was just me but after reading several other reviews I see that others agree on just how difficult this thing is to assemble/disassemble.  The locks are impossible, the items do not quite fit right, and it would be impossible to get this thing into its "travel bag."  The mattress is thin and very lumpy; each fold in this mattress causes hard lumps.  I bought this product thinking I could use it as a portable play yard after my baby out grows the co-sleeper aspect but there is no way.  I recommend you avoid this product!
LUCKY FOR ME I DIDN'T PAY FOR THIS PUMP BUT THE HOSPITAL GAVE IT TO ME. I COULD ONLY GET TWO DROPS OF MILK FOR EVERY TEN PUMPS. WHAT A WASTE OF TIME. YOU WOULD FIGURE THE HOSPITAL WOULD KNOW IF THE PUMP WORKED
This microphone is listed as a compatible accessory for the Sony HDR-HC7 video camera on most websites, including SonyStyle.  While the microphone may be of good quality (I didn't have an opportunity to thoroughly test it), it is only marginally compatible and a very poor choice for the HDR-HC7.  The microphone does plug into the MIC jack on the camera and appears to work, but the shoe does not fit the hot shoe bracket on the camera.  (Note that there is no direct way to tell if it is actually working without playing the tape back, at which point it's probably too late to make a correction.)  After nearly an hour of very irritating chat room discussion and, finally, direct conversation with a Sony Technician, I learned that there is a "jury-rigged" bracket that will allow you to attach the microphone near the camera on a tripod.  Otherwise, there is no way to fix it to the camera.  The Sony technician finally admitted that it was " curious" that Sony lists this as a compatible microphone.  If you have a Sony HDR-HC7, CHOOSE A DIFFERENT MICROPHONE!
As the other reviewers stated, it's difficult for my 5 & 2-year-olds (& their Mommy) to figure out.  Also, it's made of a very cheap, flimsy plastic -- which seems to be the norm for a lot of the Hot Wheels tracks, etc. Terrible truck with such great potential
With astute attention to the details of character, setting and daily life, Susan Kelly illuminates the ordinary. Pondering love, memory, faith,and responsiblity, Kelly transforms the everyday into the quintessential. This is a beautifully rendered story
I wanted a simple product with a good red eye removal tool.  This program does not do well with fixing red eye.  Software did not come with a manual. I am computer literate yet I found this software not easy to navigate. I found HP Essentials which is a free download from the HP website to be a better program.
I hate to admit I actually own this thing on VHS.  And unless my mind is going more than usual, I have this cut of the movie too. ---  --- Double (and more) dipping by the studios seems to be the way of DVD.  We get at least four issues of Terminator 2, but none of Robinson Crusoe on Mars.  I personally am sick of it. ---  --- Director's Cuts, Unrated Editions, and other snaky ways of trying to separate my money from my wallet.  No wonder I've taken to borrowing nearly all my DVDs from the Public Library. ---  --- No, you generally don't get them the day they come out.  But honestly, when was the last time you purchased a movie from Hollyweird that was worth keeping?  Don't do it
Our three Asian-American granddaughters got these today for Christmas and they love them! Ignore the 5-star reviews that trash these cute little dolls, then try to steer you to eBay for another doll. These are the genuine article and kids LOVE them, as they have for generations. Our thirty-plus daughter-in-law still has her original Cabbage Patch doll, and she still loves it, just as her daughters loved theirs today
I have had this phone (and Virgin Mobile pay as you go service) for only a day or two, but I wanted to write this review before I forget. I'll update it if I change my mind. ---  --- Once you get over the industrial strength plastic clamshell monster it comes in, it's a good ride. The phone resembles a small remote control. It's sleek and unassuming. Turn it on and things get a bit zany with the animations on the color screen, but it's a pleasant experience. The sound quality is good on both ends of the conversation.  ---  --- It's attractive. It works. It seems a real no-brainer given the other choices for the Virgin Mobile service. You can have fun with it or just ignore the fun stuff--but you'll have to get used to the funny graphics. ---  --- The UI is totally intuitive. You interact with the menus on the screen and the few keys below it as if you've been doing it a while after only setting up your preferences.  ---  --- One thing: this whole service and the software on this phone are marketed to a younger demographic than mine (thirties). While it's a good basic cell phone and the plan is appealing (pay as you go--for me 18c/min), there's a ton of stuff to play with if your train gets stuck in a tunnel. I have Lily Tomlin's operator character answering my voicemail and found a wallpaper with my first name spelled out in diamonds; and if I should ever receive a text message, among my canned response options (that come standard with the phone) are "Hell no," "Can't talk," and "Leave me alone." ---  --- My friend has had one for a few months and loves his. He makes a good bit more money than I and sports some fancy handheld devices, so it's not just that it's so cheap and cool. ---  --- 
This book was on a very interseting topic. The author took time in studying this topic. It was about the impending world oil shortage. That is the time when we, the world, will run out of oil. It tells you about Hubbert's analysis of the time or year when the world will run out of oil. They then talk about a lot of other things like where oil comes from. Then they talk about where oil is. They also talk about drilling for oil. They say it takes people over 20 drills to find oil. sometimes it will take even more time then that. Then they talk about the size of oil fields. They also reexamine Hubbert's analysis later on in the book. Rate plots is brought up because the more people driving the less oil we will have in the future. They talk about the future to fossil fuels and discuss elctricity and natural gases. They also talk about how much we already have so when oil runs out we need to think about all the stuff we already have. Hubbert was a brilliant man. some gas companys tried to make him stay quiet but he didn't want to he told everybody. The author was ver knowledgable and I could tell he knew what he was talking about. ---  --- I wouldn't recommend this book to anybody unless they are very smart and want to know about the impending world oil shortage. I say again the author took time in studying this topic but that was his downfall in that he went into to much depth and made it boring. When you read it you can tell the author knew what he was talking about but he got to much into detail which is very boring. I gave it a low rating because I have a short attenion span so it was hard enough for me to make it through this book
Other than the power switch is not easy to see, the most issue with this microphone is the sound quality  not that good.  Use this microphone to record music for sure will disappoint you.  Even using it for church meeting recording, you would not get excited for its sound quality. ---  --- If you can tolerate the size of Sony ECM-MS907, you may like the sound quality of that microphone. If you like a small lapel microphone with true voice, try the AKG WMS-40 wireless system.  Our people are much happier with the AKG wireless microphone than this one. --- 
I rarely write reviews, but I need to comment on how fantastic this compilation is.  I have a four-year-old and an eighteen-month-old, and this CD is in heavy rotation at our house.  My husband and I love the music at least as much as they do -- it's stylish and sets a great mood as we're making dinner and doing dishes.  The kids love it too, needless to say.  My four-year-old's favorites are Three Blind Mice (she loves when the farmer's wife squeaks that she'll give back the tails) and the final track by Peggy Lee (where she says the word *poop*, as in "party poop" -- endless laughter ensues).  Ella Fitzgerald's A-Tisket, A-Tasket and Chew, Chew Your Bubblegum are priceless.  All in all, I highly recommend this CD -- everyone will be happy to hear it again and again
I'm used to using a teflon coated electric griddle that has much more space than the Baby Q Griddle.  Cooking eggs and pancakes on the cast iron proved challenging and everything cooked much faster (too fast, at first).  The lack of a drain hole made cooking the bacon very greasy.  It got to the point where I had to remove the bacon, remove the griddle, dump the grease and continue cooking.  On the PLUS side the griddle fits perfectly and the included chrome handles make removing the griddle safe and effortless
I'm with everyone else when they say they were diappointed by this product. I opened this bottle, expecting a totally yummy scent but what I got was nothing like what I expected! When I read that it smelled the Nesquick, I thought I'd like it anyway, because I love Strawberry Nesquick. But this stuff smells like...well, I can't describe it. All I know is I wish I hadn't paid $16 for it. Live and learn, I guess --- Perhaps the Strawberry Ice Cream 3-in-1 gel smells better. Off topic, why do they have a Strawberry Milk Shake 3-in-1 gel And a Strawberry Ice Cream 3-in-1 gel? Wouldn't they smell just the same
It is now almost a month since I bought the upgrade to XP Prof. for my destop computer running W2K Prof. I have had nothing but trouble. My notebook computer, connected by a wireless next for almost 18 months, suddenly could not connect to the desktop. All network setup and trouble-shooting help did nothing. I called MS and things got worse. Now I have an dditional problem (no sound on my desktop) and the first problem remains unsolved. I have been through three layers of MS technicians, only the last of which spoke English with an accent close enough to mine to be understood. Nonce could fix the problems and they are now "researching" the problem and supposed to call me this morning. During one of the calls, the tech. tried to blame it on my notebook. If any of you are old enough to remember when there was only one telephone company, you'll ercognize the situation. Right now, I would prefer getting a refund and returning to W2K
I was always hunting for popcorn salt in markets and only occasionally finding it....this is just what I wanted and in a large enough size to be economical and last for a whil
If you buy all three of these items individually from Amazon.com they cost $11.50 LESS than buying them in this set! ---  --- Other than that, I highly recomend these.  I grill several times a week and these have been put to good use with no complaints
This is a complete waste of money. (1) It's clunky and hard to carry around. (2) Not really a good value for money based on the MP's it offers. I would recommend you spend the add'l $50 and get a nicer camera! This one is crap
With all clear coat finishes on modern automobiles, the finish may look pretty good even when then outer layer is beginning to deteriorate. So "waxing" is still important. I recommend a fresh application of polish twice per year for maximum protection. --- I have been following Cosumers Reports recommedations. Three years ago, their recommendation was NuFinish liquid. This year, CR recommneds Black Magic Liquid Automobile Polish.  --- The liquids are easy to apply, and seem to last at least as long as the paste waxes. --- In my opinion the Black Magic is at least as good as the rest. I like the cherry scent.
The length of the jacket could be a little longer...bairly hits the belt
My family loves this game because there are several different games you can play with it and it goes along with the book, so the kids like to compare it.This product is very durable and will last
Their work out are very effective if you comply with the guideliness for each move and routine. I love it!!! ---  --- Been a member for 2 years already
I'm trying to figure out what the appropriate subtitle for this book should be and I can't decide among the following: ---  ---     * Travels Through Guilt with the World's 33rd Richest Hippie ---     * The Mind of an Empty Suit ---     * A Self-Important Revisionist History ---     * How I Learned to Hate Myself and Love the Third World ---     * Memoirs of a Cold War Paperpusher ---  --- Confessions of an Economic Hitman by John Perkins is an exclamation point riddled history of a few financial manipulations of the Cold War by a man who had no stake in his own ambition. ---  --- The first thing you notice about this account is that it is written by a man who thinks he was sitting on top of the world, when in fact he was just a cog in the energy industry. If you are credulous enough to believe that the debts and revenues associated with the energy business is indeed the core principle of the global economy, then the moral outrage of this book makes sense. But there's a whole lot to swallow. ---  --- On the plus side, it's a fast and somewhat entertaining read. Otherwise it is a exercise in the slow revelations of a kind of self-loathing that takes about 20 years to surface. ---  --- One of the things that I've had in mind as I was reading this screed was the sense of geography as destiny. As I look at the 20th Century, I think of most of it focused on the economics of . Perkins was one of the people who made the truth a narrative of economic exploitation. He falls in love with Socialist charismatics in Latin America, rues the lives of poor peasants, and bemoans the basic nature of corporate capitalism without ever acknowledging or even understanding the basic nature of socialism. ---  --- Perkins is a perfect example of a cultural relativist. a perceptive reader can see how much he hates his hometown and parents and idolizes romantic ideals associated with revolutionary rhetoric. But you can't imagine that he even had the temerity to read Marx, Weber, Engles, Friere or anyone. Back when I was a bit more blackified, I referred to such people as culture vultures. If it's indigenous, it's good. But you'll never see him once talk about infant mortality statistics, literacy rates, crime rates or even inflation. ---  --- I discovered a bit too late that this book would teach me nothing about the business of foreign direct investment or the workings of the World Bank except that he saw it as evil. Technically, you'll get a great deal more insight reading Wikipedia. Basically, Perkins assumes that his game was the only game on the planet, his company was smack dab in the middle of it and that it was all being subtley directed by the CIA and NSA and that this is, was and always will be the American way. You really get a foggy view of the Evil Empire of America from Perkins, who resembles nobody quite so much as a cynical wanker who is too soulless to quit the game. It's a confession all right. ---  --- By the time I got 2/3rds of the way through, reading the book began to become annoying. The incredible vacuity of this man was staggering. There are no personal relationships in the book worth speaking of. He found loyalty only to his bosses worth mentioning. It is a stunning revelation about his character that he never once had a kind word to say or any personal quality worth mentioning about his staff that stands out in memory.  We learn that he took one of his charges (female) on a yacht cruise to some isle in the Caribbean, but that when he got there, he was so sickened by his guilty conscience that he banged his head against the coconut trees. ---  --- If you want to understand something about the life of an economist and high finance, the best book I've read is My Life as a Quant. If you want to understand something about the life of a reluctant spy, the best book to read is Larry Kolb's Overworld. If you want to get well-written account of a man who was too spoiled to find himself while being a toady in the economic hardball of the Cold War era, then this is your book. But it's nowhere near as good as, say The Quiet American. ---  --- You can imagine that Perkins, who is a great admirer of Graham Greene, might have had aspirations to be such a character as Greene might pen. He is earnest to tell such a story that would portray himself thus, but he is to honest to consider himself heroic, and I suspect that he'll be working off his guilt for the rest of his life. In that regard, 'Confessions of an Economic Hitman' is (now prefaced and extended in the paperback edition) a blueprint for American liberal guilt. If there was ever someone who truly believed that global warming and a host of other blowbacks are destined to doom America to a well-deserved kharmic smackdown, it is John Perkins. He has always been a citizen of the world pretending to be a patriotic American, down to the repetitions of his undying faith in the words of Thomas Paine. You'd think, being a pseudo-economist, that he'd have some room in his heart for Alexander Hamilton. Ahh but that would mean that he'd have to admire courage. ---  --- I didn't want to be a harsh judge of Perkins. I thought I might learn of an extraordinary life, one of conviction and then epiphany. Instead I learned of a small yapping dog who was always on a leash he lacked the spirit to gnaw through.  Someone who would tell us in the end that we should use less oil and that 'corporatocray' is evil. This book has been a disappointment in many ways. I may well be very happy to read Thomas Friedman after this. ---  --- Good parts? ---  --- Yeah there are a few. He speaks about a few South American presidents who might have been contenders. He gives a few details about Saudi Aramco. But compared to Larry Kolb's fascinating and detailed portraits of Daniel Ortega and Adnan Khashoggi, this is Romper Room. If Perkins thought he was an agent... don't make me laugh
What a waste of time, money, and talent. If its Murder you want well this one has plenty of blood and guts to fill the bill. Sorry I wasted my time viewing such trash
The combination of Grant and Kerr is wonderful on the screen. I loved the mix of British humor and civility. Adding the dash of American brashness in Robert Mitchum, one can enjoy watching the wheels fall off.  A very enjoyable movie
This is the best working and cheapest cheating device for the PS2. For all you adults who think that the memery card corruption is permanant, well, do some research! I can figure out a way to solve the problem, and I'm only 13! You are all over 21! AR Max Memory has a formatting feature, which scrapes all of the corrupted data away. Yes, you will lose your hard-earned saves, but that's the price for cheating. Who ever said that cheating would be fair? Overall, besides the Max Memory portion, this item is great
I received the bundle but there is no installation key for Shade LE. ---  --- I noticed the someone else's review stating this same problem is no longer visible so I figured I'd post it again
First off, let me say that I know next to nothing about art.  I would like to cultivate an appreciation for great artwork, but it certainly does not come naturally - especially when it comes to modern art.  Dali, however, is a master I at least have some affinity with.  Who doesn't know of the melting clocks?  I have also seen the dream sequence he created for Hitchcock's film Spellbound in 1945.  Plus, the guy was just plain weird, and that is something I know a little bit about myself. ---  --- This Artists of the 20th Century DVD looks solely at Dali's artwork.  All you see throughout the 50 minutes of video is one piece after another.  There is no biographical look at the man, no mention of his contributions to the world beyond his paintings, and certainly no commentary on his eccentric personality (or mustache).  There is not even an adequate identification of Gala, his inspiration and muse, despite numerous references to her in his paintings.  Thus, this DVD will not introduce you to Dali the man or Dali the artist - it only looks at selected pieces of the art work of the maestro. ---  --- Dali's artwork is obviously impressive, and I was surprised by the variety of his work and styles.  The narrator offers insight into some paintings - others, you just look and advance.  I don't understand a lot of Dali's work, nor can I see some of the things the narrator tells me are in his more abstract pieces.  The melting clocks and other surrealist images appeal to me.  Dark works such as Visage of War speak volumes to the human observer, and the disappearing bust of Voltaire paintings are also striking.   I was most impressed by the small sample of classical pieces Dali painted, however - largely because I did not know he ever produced such works.  My idea of a painting equates with something like Design for the Interior Decoration of a Stable-Library, which is a strikingly beautiful work. ---  --- Is this DVD worth watching?  I will have to say No.  If you're a know-nothing novice like me, there is not enough basic information provided to really illuminate the artwork you will be shown.  If you're knowledgeable about Dali, you'll be disappointed by the limited nature of the production and by the exquisite Dali works excluded from the show.  After watching this, I decided to peruse some Dali galleries online, and I must say that the Internet makes this DVD of little value.  Not only are the analyses and critical comments you will find online far superior to the information provided in this video, the quality of the paintings themselves are far better online than they are on the DVD
This wiffle bat is light and easy to use.  Substitue it for a whip or crop when training your young horse.  It will not hurt the horse, but will get the horse's attention
Hard to imagine something could make one's honey even sweeter, but this fills the bill. The little jars make it easy for you to try different flavors (as opposed to being stuck with a large quantity of one). All of them were quite yummy, too. The only thing I would change is the brush that's included -- it's tiny, which makes it fun to tease and do little bits at a time, but it could be just a bit broader. The bristles tend to get overwhelmed by the chocolate. Then you just use your fingers..
These are my favorite earrings: I wear them constantly. They are unique and jazz up even the most utilitarian outfit. They are a bit larger than you might anticipate,and it is a size I really like but which might overpower some. The picture, at least on my monitor, is about life-sized
Summary:  --- I wasted a lot of time trying to make this work, and I eventually went back to other products.   ---  --- In theory, integrating virus checker, firewall, spyware, and data backup into a unified suite (like MS Office with Word, Excel, & PowerPoint) makes sense.  However, this software package seems poorly made; it did not work very well for me.   ---  --- Hardware, OS, & primary software used:  --- 1.  Dell Lattitude D620 Laptop with 2GB RAM, Windows XP, MS Office --- 2.  Dell X1 Laptop (thin/lightweight) with 2GB RAM, Windows XP, MS Office --- 3.  Dell Dimension Desktop with 4 GB RAM, Windows XP, children's games ---  --- Prior virus/spyware products:  --- Lattitude & X1: Norton --- Dimension: freeware provided by our ISP ---  --- Theory:  Since Microsoft makes the OS & office applications that get infected with viruses, their product should be better integrated with the OS.  There will be synergy by integrating several related software applications.   ---  --- Lesson:  --- Well, after a series of terrible experiences, I hope others will benefit from my wasted time:  ---  --- 1.  Instead of loading most of the program from the CD & downloading small updates, this seems to load only a small part of the program and downloads huge files.  This made me feel that the product was shipped unfinished.  You had to do this separately for each machine since it hides the downloaded files then deletes them prior to finishing the installation.  This took a better part of an afternoon.   ---  --- 2.  I purchased a 3-pack license.  Installing and activating the software on the 2nd & 3rd machines required a series of very annoying steps that involved logging into their website with broken links.  It finally required a phone call.  At least, the phone support experience was good.  ---  --- 3.  The product promises to minimize performance impact, and improve overall performance.  On the Lattitude & Dimension (powerful machines), there was no difference in performance, but we could notice a slightly slower performance with the X1.  This was later verified when we uninstalled the MS Windows OneCare and replaced it with another product.   ---  --- 4.  The product has difficulty updating.  It opens a small message box that asks you to click to update OneCare, but that takes you to a webpage that only works about 1 in 4 times.   ---  --- 5.  Except for the first time, data backup always has several errors that I have to manually fix.  This has very rarely happened with other data backup software I've used.   ---  --- 6.  Some applications, the firewall asks everytime for permission to connect to the Internet although the application is in the list to always allow this connection. 
I actually bought 2 different pair of diamond ear rings. The 14k gold ones were the keepers! They are pretty and big enough to use as a second pair in my ears! Thanks to Amazon for this offering
These earrings looked great and I really liked them but in less than a month, the posts broke completely off and the earrings are now completely useless
The Cherry Covered Choccolate Luna Bars are quite tasty. Chances are, if you're eating a chocolate cherry nutrition bar, you  need a little enticement to eat healthy. Like all these bars you do get sick of the same flavor day after day. I recommend alternating between these and another bar that's not so sweet (kashi trail mix bars are perfect). That helps me stick to the bars instead of hitting up the zillion calorie pastries at the corner coffee shop
Not very bright for an LED.  AND, guess what? This is about 2 1/2 inches long if it is standing on its tippy-toes! --- Given the picture shows a spike on it, one could have the impression that it is big enough to spike into the ground and mark a trail or something... well, the spike is more like a thumbtack. --- I realize the images are provided by the manufacturer, so I don't blame Amazon - but there is NO excuse for not accurately listing the actual size of this.
I have watched most of the BS series and this is one that shows what is happening to many of our american organizations. Religious control
I bought this system recently after my Panasonic DVD Surround System broke. I was a little leary about this system since other reviewers have mentioned a hissing noise here on Amazon and other sites for that matter. But I couldn't find anything like this value and decided I could just take it back if I didn't like it. Well, I love it! The sound is great! Subwoofer is awesome! I do not hear a hissing noise at all. This sounds so much better than my Panasonic which broke and that I had paid $100 more for
I did not get what I ordered in this case. I got licorice but it was not the salt type I ordered
I bought this for my 12 year old who so far hasn't been able to get it to play.  (I haven't either)  Before giving up on it, we have to retrieve --- the directions from his grandmother's house and read them thoroughly.  I'm --- disapointed since Coby's have a good reputation
Wow!  This movie is deeply entrenched on my list of worst movies of all time.  I watched it last night and I woke up in a bad mood.  Everything about it sucked except for the nudity (hence the single star).  I understand it was supposed to be something of a "comedy", but without a touch of reality, I found myself laughing at the movie instead of with it.  The acting is awful, the soundtrack is hideous and the plot is a joke.  Michael Caine's goofy appearance was accentuated with some GINORMOUS glasses... there isn't a teen girl alive who would find that "sexy".  When I saw the 'Blame it on Rio' reviews on this site, I felt the urge to hunt down every person who gave it more than 2 stars (many gave it 5!!), strangle them, then watch as they emptied the contents of their bowels all over the floor.
I have always wanted a turkey fryer but they was to spendy and at this price I had to get it although I was a litte reluctant buying it off the internet  then I received it not only was I happy with it,I was also relieved that I didnt get ripped off with Another internet scam(Thats why I ordered through Amazon,so I would be safe from fraud)Anyway I havent yet fried my turkey but I know that they will taste great!!!!!
I reach for CK One on days that I want a crisp, fresh scent.  Intended to be a unisex fragrance, it is not at all sweet or flowery.  However, it does have a softness to it that I personally believe makes it better suited to a woman than a man; I find it to be slightly musky without being masculine.  Overall, this is a really nice, neutral fragrance for everyday wear
My reaction is quite similar to the other reviewer.  I received my watch a few weeks ago (only took three days) and was impressed by its classy look---all my other casios have been basic black clunkers.  I like that the toggle switches protrude, so it's easy to activate them---those old recessed ones drove me crazy trying to get a nail or golf tee in there. It has all the features I wanted, but I had the same reaction about the alarm.  It's less assertive than the other casios I've had, and I don't think I can trust it to wake me up early or if I'm tired. I've already decided to buy an inexpensive alarm to put by my bed.  Because the screen showing the digital data is small, it's not always easy to read what's on it, especially if the watch hand is partially obscuring the screen, which somehow seems to happen a lot.  The back light only goes on one second at a time, and isn't very strong, so there's a good chance that you won't be able to read the digital screen that quickly.  FYI, the 10 year battery claim is based on using one second of backlight each day, so you better look quick and look sharp----but not often.  So.......great looks, but personality could be better.  That's life
In the description that ToysRUs has on the Amazon page it states that the AC Adapter is included in the box.  There is no adapter and I don't look forward to using AA batteries.  We selected this item because it said that it WOULD have batteries.
This game is awesome!  It is addictive though so be prepared.  A little complicated once you get started, but becomes easier.  Best if someone already knows the game to teach it.  Really fun though
I have been buying this brand of prescription goggles for at least 10 years. The price has been gradually coming down each year. I was surprised to find them so reasonably priced at Amazon of all places. These fit well, adjust easily and are extremely durable. I swim 6 days each week and I can easily get over a year of use from each pair. Typically the gaskets begin to deteriorate long before the lenses, when used daily outdoors in chlorinated pools. Keep them stored safely so the lenses don't scratch and rinse them in clear water after swimming and you'll be thoroughly satisfied with your purchase
My sone received this as a gift and was very excited about it at first, but as another reviewer mentioned, it quickly becomes frustrating if you don't follow the directions EXACTLY. After a few minutes he gave up and moved on. ---  --- I finally donated it to charity with my son's blessing - and this is a kid who saves everything
Although I like this album, there's nothing that especially stands out about it. It's typical Bright Eyes, and if you already love the band you won't be disappointed. However, it's not one of their best albums. It's not as good as Lifted, not as addicting as Fevers and Mirrors, and not as raw and endearing as Letting off the Happiness. But yet again, Conor succeeds in writing songs that capture all of the emotion without making me ill in a Dashboard Confessional sort of way
Installed quickly and with no problems. Does not slow the machine down as much as Norton antivirus.
I bought a pair in January and loved them. Sound is as lovely as everyone describes. However, there are something seriously lacking in the build quality. The soft wires felt flimsy to me when I first opened it, but I thought I'd just take extra care.  ---  --- At 1 month of careful usage, the plastic-covered wires from earbuds downwards became so weather-hardened that I could almost use them as chopsticks, and makes it so the earbuds popped out at the slightest motion. At 2 months of careful usage, the wires had half-ripped from the plug--which I repaired the best I could with unsightly electrical tape. However, at 3rd month, the left bud fell completely off.  ---  --- I am very disappointed--it is one of the best-sounding phones I've ever had (I've owned both Grado s60 and s90, and sennheisers), but man, they need to do something about making this baby last
I haven't used this camping, but I set it up in my living room as soon as I got it in the mail and it took about 2 minutes.  It looks great and I can't wait to try it out camping this summer with my family of five!!  I know exactly where I am going to put all of my camping dining essentials on this kitchen. 
I'm sure glad I did not purchase this cd.  Back in the 1980's I had very little knowledge about O'Bryan Burnnette, but now that I am 22 and appreciate old school music a whole lot more, I know they made several mistakes while releasing this compilation.  "Soul Trains A Comin" (although not a chart hit) was missing.  I would perfer the original version than the 12 inch version used for Soul Train from seasons 13-"Maria" (a lackluster lp track from his latest lp, Surrender) should have been replaced with the beautiful "Together Always" (from his proper sophmore lp, You & I).  The horrible and silly "Drivin' Force" (also from Surrender) should have been out!  "Lovelite", "You & I" and "I'm Freaky" lp versions should have been on there instead of the 45 versions because they stood out very well!!  "Is This For Real," Right From The Start," and "Love Has Found Its Way." were the other great ballads and jams that were non-singles but were gems as well.  The absense of "Soul Trains A Comin'(original)", "Together Always", and full versions of "You & I", "I'm Freaky", and "Lovelite" really knocked off 3 points from Best of O'Bryan cd and should be made into a redo!!  For those that wasted thier money on this, "go on and cry" because Right Stuff Records done ripped y'all off!!  This underated talented artist (good singer, writer, producer, and instrumentalist) was trying to be the next Prince and Michael Jackson but he was considered more like a 1980s version of Carl Thomas (too soulful for the mainstream).   ---  --- People must have bought this cd (if do not have original lps no more) because more than half of the tracks are not available on other cds.    ---  --- I admit I love all the songs from the cd (except for Maria and Driving Force), but I WILL create a new CD under my productions, SOUL TRAIN ALUMNI SERIES along with my own compilations of Shalamar, Jermaine Stewart, Pebbles, Jody Watley and other Soul Train almumnis.   ---  --- 1. Soul Trains A Comin' (original although I love the remix; loved the keyboard fanfare on the intro) --- 2. The Gigolo --- 3. Still Waters --- 4. Right From The Start (great track and catchy hooks!!) --- 5. I'm Freaky (full lp verison, the keyboard solo was missing from the 45 single 4 minute version) --- 6. You & I (full original lp version.  Loved the closing) --- 7. Together Always (O showed his true feelings on this 1983 track) --- 8. Lovelite (full original lp version - LOVELITE BABY!!) --- 9. Breakin' Together (good effort and loved the video!!) --- 10. Go On & Cry (good ballad) --- 11. Lady I Love You (what ever happened to lovin' your woman and tellin' her how you feel.  This was his best ballad ever and this  should school young catz like Bobby Valentino and R Kelly on real love.) --- 12. You're Always On My Mind (I'm glad they included this lp track from 1984's Be My Lover on the compilation and would be good for the redo.  Beautiful ballad that shows a woman on how you feel although she's seeing someone else).   --- 13. Tenderoni (45 single, I never actually heard of the full lp track before but it was a good pre-new jack single) --- 14. Is This For Real (great!!!) --- 15. You Have Got To Come To Me (beautiful new jack ballad that should have made the charts) ---  --- This here is the real Best of O'Bryan plus more.  Wish I can add more like "I'm In Love Again", "Doin' Alright", "Surrender" "Love Had Found Its Way" and "Shake" but had to pick the best 16 that would fit!!  ---                                                          -- Thank You!!
I used to devour the De-Lite Dark Chocolate bars but Walmart stopped carrying them.  Damn!  Well, these are just as tasty!  I agree with these other people...this makes the grade.  For those of you who want to stay away from sugar for one reason or another, these bars "hit the spot" when the chocolate craving strikes
I used this product this morning for the first time.  I washed my hair, blew it dry, most of the way, then rubbed the product in my hands and lightly distributed it throughout my hair.  The best way for me to describe it, is that, it is like a creamy hairspray.  Yes, it is tacky, like hairspray can be, but that's how it helps you get the style you want.  What I like about how it works on my hair, is that it really tamed the frizzes and brought down the "big" hair look that I usually have after blowing my thick hair dry.  I think it would also work well on the days that I blow my hair out.  I would probably blow it out first, then apply some dirt to help tame and smooth it.  I can see where it might make thinner, straighter hair a bit limp, so be careful not to use very much. ---  --- Edit:  I think it is best to apply to slightly damp hair, that might help with the people that are having trouble applying it to completely dry hair
Hearty, great-tasting cereal. Has a whole grain flavor. Originally looked at it because of lower carbs than other cereals (which is better for my reduced carb diet). But it has quickly become a favorite cereal and buying six boxes at a time through Amazon.com nets out at a lower cost per box than buying it at local grocery stores.
I just came accross this ad, and thought to say something about the price of this item.  Please be aware that many other merchants sell this product for about half the price. 
Bluetooth cannot be accessed when the phone is in the pouch. --- Phone cannot not be charged while in the pouch.
I love this little cutter!  The base is only 6" wide so it's perfect for traveling.  The orange part of the handle and the measuring arm both store under the unit.  The key to using this cutter properly is to hold your paper securely with the orange paper guard, which is attached to the top of the cutter.  The only downside to the cutter is when you have to cut at a specific place or around a text box; it's difficult to see where you're cutting unless you have a light source under the cutting edge.  Otherwise, I would suggest it to anyone
The magazine is not bad, marginal at best. To my surprise, I am now a member of a club. I also was surprised to receive the first of a series of gardening books (mine to keep for a small fee). --- Needless to say, the description for the magazine was not forthcoming with the additional items and obligations (mailing the book back, etc).  --- All I wanted was the magazine. I don't like to feel like I was taken advantage of. Please pass on this one. THere are plenty of other good gardening magazines to order.
My son has played with these from 6 months old, and still likes them occasionally (18 months now).  The small car is nice for babies to shake.  They don't do much, but they are cute
Wow 5 blades instead of three? Who would have thought of that? I smell noble price here!  --- Don't let the great cosmetic design fool you. It turned out to be the same thing but with more blades.  --- I was really excited waiting for my brand new Fusion Power razor to arrive, I am allergic to shaving so this was a big issue for me. After the first shave my hopes were destroyed. It turned out to be about the same thing. They even mentioned the blades being closer as an improvement, when in fact, I think they were forced to do it that way because if not they would have ended up with a huge cartridge that would not fit the contours of the face.  The only obvious new feature is the trimmer, which is only that, a feature, and not a real technical advance. --- I hope that someday these companies start to invest a part of the income they get from the overpriced cartridges in research and development, instead of investing it in marketing. --- By the way, my power handle came broken, so I couldn't test this feature, although I have had power handles in the past with other blades and the difference was minimal. --- What will be next, let me guess, 7 blades? I guess that these guys should really start working in something new because the "adding more blades" thing is getting exhausted. --- 
I am quite satisfied with this product overall.  Sometimes it is too sensative and gets electrical interferrence.  During armer weaather when the window was opened I also picked up air traffic but over all it is a very  good product
Great recording, but if you want to actually use it, like load it on your ipod it has sony's stupid DRM. Meaning you can't. DON'T BUY SONY PRODUCTS!!
Excellent service, ontime delivery, perfect match for my grill.  Thanks for the detailed descriptions and pictures of the products you sell. 
I thought this hot air brush would make things easier by not having to hold a round brush and blow dryer. It's a great idea, but it just doesn't work as well as that.  ---  --- First let me say I have shoulder length, normal hair, but a lot of it. If I air dry, it is slightly wavy. I used the larger of the two brushes and found it couldn't get through my hair. So then I was using a second hand to try to push the hair against the brush so it would curl around it. That didn't work very well, and I wound up burning my hands more than once. I also found that I couldn't get the same nice curl with this hot air brush that I could get by using a regular round brush and dryer.  ---  --- The other major problem was that the brush got extremely hot. If you have an idea that you'll be able to change from the larger brush size to smaller (or the unit without the attachment) or vice versa, you won't without getting burned. The attachment--even the end of the blow dryer itself--is simply too hot to touch. I was doing things like using a hand towel to try to change attachments.  ---  --- The size and shape of the unit is also not optimal. I found it too large and awkward to use. The off button is located right where your hand is, so it's easy to bump. Also, there's no cold shot. If you've come to appreciate what that can do for setting a curl, you'll probably miss it like I did.  ---  --- Additionally, as another person has mentioned, the unit is very loud. You would be wise to buy a couple foam ear plugs if you are determined to keep this brush and keep your hearing. I don't believe I read any warning about the noise, either. It's much louder than my traditional guy-style blow dryer.  ---  --- Time wise, I found that I spent much longer trying to get my hair dry, and then I wasn't fully satisfied with the style as well as the burns and hassle involved in getting there. I gave this a try for a few days and then returned it to the store for a refund. It made me appreciate the traditional blow dryer and round brush. Some things are just not as good as they seem.
I've decided to buy this collection after a reading a lot of reviews from different websites.  But none of them are very clear about the contents of the package, so here is the contents of the package  ---  --- 1.Icewind Dale (2 CD's) --- 2.Icewind Dale Expansion Heart of Winter (1CD) --- 3.Icewind Dale II (2 CD's) --- 4.Icewind Dale soundtrack --- 5.Icewind Dale II bonus disk --- 6.Icewind dale strategy guides, trailer of IWD II ---  --- This package is well worth the purchase, u get a series of one of the best selling game, developed by pioneers who have also developed games like Fallout series, BG1 abd BG2. ---  --- The graphics are great, they look bright and crisp.  The soundtrack is great and suits well with the ambience, u really feel the snow falling and the cold weather. ---  --- The gameplay is fun, it is more like a hack n slash game, i'm a greatest fan of diablo series, so i love this game as well.  To put it in a nut shell, this game is Hack n slash with D&D rules.  If u like diablo u will certainly like this.  Baldurs gate fans will slightly get disappointed with the game play. Charecter creation is great, this game allows dual class charecters, so it adds more fun to gameplay. My only complaint is, there is no interation within r party members, but this doesn't affect the gameplay experience. ---  --- Overall if u ever have a thought of getting this game and don't know whether its worth the money, the answer is plainly, a best value for r money
I received the trousers in a timely manner.  They were what i expected although they did not fit.  I returned them a month ago and have not heard a word from the company. 
Bones is one of my favorite TV series. This one episode I missed so I had to get it to keep on track. Great show even if you have never seen it from the begining
This was purchased as a gift for a duck hunter.  He had used other head lamps but absolutely loved this one for the brightness and accuracy of the light when he moves his head.  I would highly recommend this product
Perfect, exactly what I expected and wanted. I ride to work in rain or shine or storm and was sick of the water shooting up, had it on in less then 5 min. My bike is full suspension, 26 inch wheels with that horse shoe (U) bar on the lower legs of the front fork and it still fit with no problem. Don't know how it would handle a crash in trees though, sits high like a dirt bike look. People ask where I got it

Looking for a nice well-rounded magazine with the major focus on contemporary interior design? Miss superb printing quality, clean European lines, meticulous attention to details? You've got it all in this magazine. After moving here in the US from a major European capital, I have frankly missed a good magazine with the latest trends in metropolitan interior design. Architectural digest is great if you live in a grand mansion in Ladue, but what if you want simple and elegant functionality of a nicely designed European apartment or loft in your typical suburban house. This magazine has been a delight to read (nice coffee table edition too). It has been a source of ideas and inspiration for me for several years now. Recommend highly
First order arrived damaged by the U.S. Post Office. ---  --- Order was promptly replaced at no charge. ---  --- Fast shipping to San Francisco ---  --- Delicious plump fragrant beans.  Excellent product.  Excellent customer service. 
This is a great product.  It easily performs all the functions a small business needs, if it is to be taken seriously in the marketplace.  I'm impressed at how seamless it integrates all the accounting functions.  Essentially, you never enter information more than once and it always anticipates the most logical next step.  My clients are impressed at receiving e-mailed estimates and invoices that are clear, timely and professional.  This is a must
Way too expensive for little in return. The same size piece of dark chocolate with the same calorie content would be just as filling. [...] ---     
If you are about to switch to an Xbox 360, buy this game first as your last Xbox game, you won't be disappointed. This game has the best graphics I have ever seen on a console. Although it has great graphics, the physics are the real selling point. You can pick up virtually anything in the world and throw it around or stack it with the Gravity Gun (Zero-Point Energy Manipulator). Barrels float in the water like they should and explosions are suprisingly realistic. The enemies and challenging and varied and dead bodies flop around like they should (especially when you shoot them with the shotgun). The voice acting is very well done and characters will turn to look at you if you move around. The only drawback is choppy framerates at times. Highly recommended
If you are looking to add a microphone to your product then just purchase the microphone, NOT the microhpone with these two books.  If you purchase this item then you are LIMITED to these two books!!  If you purchase the microphone you can use ALL microphone enhanced books!!!  My kids LOVE the microphone.  It is great to hear their own voice and sounds.  I give the microphone itself 5 stars
i purchased this for my son @ babies r us only because i had a gift card... but i dont regret it at all... this is one of kristobals' favorite toys from the peek a block collection! my oldest son enjoys it also! not bad for 20bu
My son is a college student in Boston and excitedly brought this board game home on one of his breaks. "You've GOT to play this game!" he said. It had been years since anyone could even so much as coax me over to a table where a board game was being played. But I wanted to spend time with my son so I consented to learn it. Turns out, it was amazing! My husband, 13-year-old son, the bringer-of-this-new-addiction and myself must have played it 20 times in the 3 weeks he was home. The "board" is different every time you play it so nothing is predictable, rolls of the die dictate one's success, trading and strategies can get intense and the more you play it, the more you definitely like it. Alas! I've "settled" into Catan mode and no longer need to beg him to bring it home from school.  I bought my own house copy plus the expansion so we can get visitors hooked on it, too. We play it all the time. Cross my heart, this is fun. As my son said, "You've GOT to play this game!"  
This product has really worked well for me!  My daughter used to love pushing her Barbie dolls in between the posts on our loft to see them crash onto the table below!  Now we don't have to worry about this anymore.  She can't reach her arm through these posts anymore either.  I use window cleaner to clean the smudge
See my review for the Desert Digital.  I own both the woodland and the desert BDU's
I RECEIVED A CD, THE TANGO CD( THE BEST TANGO ALBUM IN THE WORLD EVER) WAS DEFECTUOUS, SINCE IT PLAYS ALRIGHT  UNTIL THE 12TH SONG, BUT THEN THE SONGS STARTS GIVING WEIRD TONES. AND THE 2ND CD ACTS THE SAME WAY, SINCE MY TANGO ALBUM IS A DOUBLE CD.THE PROBLEM IS NOT FROM THE RADIO, SINCE MY OTHER PURCHASE FROM AMAZON IS IN GOOD SHAPE, AS AL MY OTHER CDS. --- THE MUSIC ALWAYS STOPS PLAYING RIGHT AT THE SAME TIME OF THE CD, THE 12 TH SONG, SO ITS PRETTY MUCH A CD PROBLEM. --- I DUNNO WHATS THE REFUND POLICY, OR CUSTOMER SERVICE NUMBER, ITS SO BAD , COS THIS TANGO CD IS GREAT. I ENJOYED IT MUCH , UNTIL......... --- TH
Listening to this cd took me back to my growing-up years.  I remembered all their songs I loved back then.  It's a great homecoming
Very tasty and healthy product. However I ordered many and discovered expiration dates when I got them. Some had only a couple of weeks which was not sufficient. Wish the date could be a lot longer and at least remind us about expiration dates in the ad
My whole family love these crackers. It's nice that they are organic with no artifical ingredients or hydrogenated oils. The only thing I wish is that they were whole grain!
Whereas the body glove cosmetically looks good, it has a diabolical flaw inherent in its POOR design. The attachment button that is mounted on the rear of the glove that allows quick engagement and disengagement to the belt clip is seriously defective. The plastic button resides in a small pocket sewn into the rear of the glove. The problem is that the button flange that holds the button connector to the glove is floating inside of the rubber elastic glove. The pocket stretches! As soon as any pressure is applied to the phone when it is hanging on your belt (like when you sit down or bump anything), the connector easily (and silently) dislodges from its elastic pocket!!! Your valuable cell phone drops to the ground and you have lost it! You have lost your phone but the button is still attached to your belt clip. This is a dreadfully constructed device that the designer should be ashamed of. Use this glove at your own peril
These guys are the best group out right now. Every single rapper is AMAZING even Bizarre who is not great so far as flow but probably has the funniest lyrics. This album brought me some of my favorite songs to date including Sh*t Can Happen, Pistol Pistol, Ain't Nuttin' But Music, American Psycho, Fight Music & Revelation. My favorite rappers are Swifty & Eminem but the fact is every one should have a solo album out by now (besides Em, only Proof (R.I.P.) & Bizarre do... which are my least favorite rappers in the group) Every song is great even the skits are enjoyable. If you don't have this yet, you are missing out on one of the best cds ever
Produc in good condition, easy to use. Best price, comparing it whit other selling companies
Very poor quality, falling apart at the seams. Also really long.
Cryptic and confusing muddle of mush. If this is the "new style" of writing, we are in trouble folks.
I ordered this product June 21st and am now told i should receive it by Oct 28th.   I wouldn't waste my time ordering this product from Amazon
Very small and easy to carry. Neat on the zoom, a bit hazy on the image stabilization but overall a good buy for the buck
Though I bought this boxing glove with a $20 discount, I still think it was overpriced. ---  --- First, I had a hard time getting my hand into the glove and I only have medium-sized hands.  I make do with taped hands but using this glove with the "popular" Evergel hand wraps is out of the question.  (Tape's better than the Evergels anyway.) ---  --- Second, on one of the gloves, the Everlast label on the elastic wrist wrap started coming off, though I'd only just started hitting a heavy bag.  It's made of this cheap plastic-like material.  (You'd think for $100, you'd get a glove with every detail of medium to high quality.)  I cutoff the hanging label entirely. ---  --- Third, the product description states five distinct layers of foam are in the glove between your hand and point of contact.  With the 10 oz glove, it doesn't feel like anything special, just a thin layer of foam.  I'm not impressed with the padding. ---  --- Overall, the glove is of medium to low quality.  It even looks cheap.  (The leather is less than a millimeter thick and the stitching is ordinary.)  I'll use the glove as I've already spent the money, but my next glove I think is going to be a Title Platinum.  Unfortunately, Everlast seems to have gone the way of cheap mass production and net profit at the sacrifice of it's reputation
This book immodestly bills itself as a unique compilation of useful information for architects.  It is devided into six sections dealing with Measure and Drawing, Proportion and Form, Codes and Guidelines, Systems and Componenets, Characteristics of Materials and a catchall final section entitled a Compendium.  In turn, each section is illustrated with wonderful line drawings and quick run downs of architectural details. ---  --- I am doubtful that any architect or engineer would find this book helpful in their practice.  The level of detail their professions require cannot be found in this slender volume.  They rely on detailed, encyclopedic volumes of construction details.   ---  --- This book is meant for architectural enthusiasts and non-professionals.  I would recommend it highly for an owner who is overseeing a bulding project.  This book is helpful in translating architectural and building terms into easily understood language. This volume would also be helpful to entry level general contractors, interior designers and people trying to design their own homes.  This book is a well written introduction to an area of study that requires years of training and access to very detailed volumes of architectural details.
  Great portability, Good picture for the price. I like the fact that I can plug this player into any TV and play DVD's and also take it in the car, camping or anywhere. I also purchased a small set of external speakers which will really improve the sound. Onboard speakers a little lacking but overall a great value
Nothing compares to these awesome notebooks. You'll never go back to the office supply variety after you've used one of these
I had bought this razor after reading some of the reviews. I used the razor as directed in the instruction manual. The manual said when you first use the razor your beard would get used to it after a few weeks of use. I used the razor for a few weeks and with ever week the bumps got worse. I had to stop using it entirely for my skin to heal. Do not buy this product
I have tried many many cell phones but this phone is unbelievable. I put a 1 gig memory card in it. Right now, I have a 140,000 word dictionary on it, the NIV bible, Star Wars, many videos of my son, about 100 wma songs, and a ton of pictures. It syncs up to MS Outlook like a charm so all of my contacts, appts, tasks, and emails are always up to date. It comes with bluetooth and works great with my logitech headset. It also has wifi which has been flawless with my wireless network and is very speedy. The screen is absolutely gorgeous. The camera takes decent pictures and video. One of the best features is the battery life. For all it does it lasts an incredibly long time. I have not found a smartphone that even comes close to these features especially for the price. I like it waaaay better than the treo, blackberries, Q, or any other qwerty device. It's glued to my hip and I use it all the time. I love it!!
If your an endurance runner this is a great book for you.  It has given me a lot of ideas of different races to run and has been a great motivator for me
I love eating a lot of cereal in the morning. Like anybody, I really don't choose a cereal that is just good for you, I really choose it for taste. I loved Special K before when it was plain flakes, but I absolutely love it even more with the addition of red strawberries. This cereal tastes even better with each morsel and bite with the addition of strawberries. I like how delightful the strawberries taste after I add the milk into the cereal. This is a great buy for anybody who loves Special K cereal, or for anyone who just hasn't considered that special challenge. ---  --- Price: B+ ---  --- Taste: A- ---  --- Overal: B
These are absolutely the most fashionable and adorable shoes on earth. They are right on the mark. I love them so much that I am ordering my second pair..not because the first fell apart, but because I simply have to have more than one pair
They arrived well packaged, and in perfect condition. They certainly look cute on my yellow Mazda! I would recommend more people to personalize their vehicles with license plate frames. The plastic molding seems sturdy thus far, and have held up nicely so far. Can't tell the difference between metal and plastic frames
This is the most unique game in recent years. Okami is a mixture of different gameplay. Prior to buying this game I was expecting more combat. You control a reincarnated god wolf and travel thru many beautiful scenaries. You will talk to people, solve simple fun puzzles, do some platforming, collect weapons, play mini-games, and fight cool enemies. Your goal is to save ancient Japan from demons. ---  --- The setting is very unique. Its Japanese mythology with cell-shaded graphic which resembles Ancient Japanese water/oil painting. There are cool Japanese style towns, cherry blossoms trees, beautiful environment and mythological enemies/beast with a Japanese twist. A visual pleasing game. You will want to see what the next level looks like, its like traveling! The bosses are really cool too! The characters are zany and funny. ---  --- One disappointment is the lack of voice acting, you have to read text! Minus 0.5 points for overall score. ---  --- The combat portion does not happen during the 'normal' game, there are talisman in the environment and when you touch it the game switches into combat scenario with confined 'border'. A unique aspect of this game is the 'celestrial brush'. Its hard to describe this gameplay but you basically draw with a brush. There are many different brush powers. You can draw and fill missing bridge gap, draw a line thru enemies and slash them to death, or draw a circle in the sky to make night turn into day. These are few examples. The game difficulty is pretty easy. Overall a fun adventure ride for everyone, all ages and players. ---  --- Graphics: 4.5/5,  Music/Sound: 5/5,  Story: 5/5,  Gameplay: 4/5,  Design: 5/5,  Fun: 4.5/5,  Value: 5/5,  Overall: 4.5/
these shoes are so cute and sexy! High heels makes a girl look so much longer and leaner! --- Beware though, if you've never bought naughtys i would go to a store and try them on first b4 buying online. I wear 8's in EVERYTHING but these, i wear 7.5. LOVE THEM!
I was amazed at how fast i recieved it and the price was amazing when i compared it with the stores here. Perfect condition. I am very pleased and  will and would recommend this place for future purchases
I've had this product for almost a year now.  I have very thick, frizzy, hair and have spent my life getting it relaxed every six months, and blowing drying it straight.  I've never used a straight iron because they could never handle my hair.  But with this one, I have not needed a blow dryer since I got it!  Now my hair is straighter than it has ever been in my life, which I thought I would never see.  Of course this makes it very straight so I can't get any shape or curls from it(which is what I was going for). Cut my drying time by almost 2 hours (as long as I apply some protective serum on when still wet).  Great product and still going strong.     
After over a year and a half including renewing for updates I've now discarded Norton SW 2006. it was problamatic and a waste of money. It conflicts with Partition magic another Symantec product and will not work with many MS updates. My system is now operating trouble free since I've uninstalled NSW. Previously my computer was eratic and crashed frquently
I love this sling!  But I'd like to stress as other people have done that you have to practice with it to find what works for you.  It may be too big for your newborn.  I started using it when my son was 4 weeks, but he was a large baby.   ---  --- I've found the key is wear it high!  The instructions say the you and your baby will be more comfortable with baby at chest height.  It's true!  If you try to wear it with the baby hanging a little lower near your stomach it's going to hurt your back and shoulder and wear you out and he/she's going to squirm and be uncomfortable.   ---  --- I used it every day of my sons 3rd month when we were in hotels between moving.  Now I used it every time I grocery shop because as soon as he's in it he falls asleep, no matter the time of day.  If I try to push him through the whole store sitting in the cart in his carseat he'll start screaming but if I put him in my sling I won't hear a peep out of him the whole trip. ---  --- And you have to admit it's so cute and stylish!  Several people have stopped to ask me where I got it and I love directing them to Amazon! 
I love this bumper. It isn't thick like the padded bumpers and fits the crib nicely, without bunching. And the price is much more reasonable than the $$ bumpers that go with bedding sets. Mostly I can feel secure that my little one is safe even if he rolls up to the edge of the railings. I know his arms and legs won't get tangled in the railings, but he also can breathe. Great product. It is cute too and looks very nice on a white crib.
Although given short shrift by the few critics who watched it, this is a worthy effort, marked by good acting, direction, technicals, and an intelligent script. Although in a state of undress through much of the film, Kelly Lynch is given an opportunity to display the full panoply of her acting range as there are essentially only two actors. And, as so often with independent films, all involved have an opportunity to be truly creative. The desert setting enhanced the starkness of the extreme emotions to which the viewer is exposed.  --- 
The tale starts out with a historical reference to Chaucer.  For a fraction you wonder if you are watching the film you expected. And then you see the Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger eagle that transitions us form mid-evil times to present day (1944) England. ---  --- Time is taken to give depth and background to all the main characters by the use of interactive dialog. We find that each brings different technical skills and interpretations of the road to Canterbury: ---  --- U.S. Army Sergt. Bob Johnson (U.S. Sergeant John Sweet) on his way to Canterbury mistakenly gets off in the hamlet of Kent. He is accused of having his stripes on upside down. ---  --- British Sgt. Peter Gibbs (Dennis Price) is temporarily stationed at Kent while staging for overseas. He was and theater organ player before the war. ---  --- Alison Smith (Sheila Sim) a London store clerk before the war is now seeking a job as a `Land Girl'. She seems to have an uncanny knowledge of Kent and the Pilgrims' road to Canterbury. ---  --- The night they got off the train at Kent they had a strange encounter with the mysterious "Glue Man".  Then befriended by the local magistrate, Thomas Colpeper, JP (Thomas Colpeper, JP). Mr. Colpeper is interested in the history of the Pilgrims' Road from Kent to Canterbury. ---  --- Until you get pretty much through this story you are never really sure where they are trying to take you.  Is the focus on a local mystery? The interaction of the players or the lives of the characters themselves? ---  --- -------------------------------------------------------------------- --- Be sure to get the Criterion version with the second DVD. The main item besides the film is the voice over commentary by film historian Ian Christie which will rival the film for entertainment and after watching you may want to give the film that other star.
Not worthy of The Firm name, this workout was repetitive, boring and doesn't belong in a Firm lineup.  If you're a true Firm believer and LOVE the originals, DON'T waste your time with this one, it will only disappoint
The game is good for all ages.  The train sounds are really great for kids.  It is fun for a holiday or any kind of group gathering
Computer Brain sent the wrong product right before Xmas so the present that I intended had to be shipped back and it is Jan. 16 and I am still awaiting the right one. So I don't even know what the product is actually like yet
As always there products are just mouth watering and top grade.
I saw the movie and liked the songs in it.  I ordered the soundtrack from the movie, but it was not the soundtrack.  They have a dubbed another person in on Ike's part.  All the songs from the movie were not on the soundtrack and some other of Tina's were included.  I feel that if it is going to be advertised as a soundtrack then it should be a true soundtrack.  I was disappointed. 
I read about this product in consumer report and was exactly as described. Went on smoothly.Shined to a bright finish. The wax provides a durable coat
I ordered a few boxes of this and I couldn't stomach this.  The spices were very off in this type of dish, to the point where it made it couldn't stand the taste of it.  It had way too much cinnamon.  I ended up throwning my other boxes out.  I would recommend Kohinoor brand over this any day.  
Excellent product for backup with the intelligence built into it. Highly recommended
Arrived just in time for the snow, my grandson who is 9 had loads of fun, however,it requires the user to have good balancing skills, like a skateboard. I would have given it a 5 star but it could have been faster had the plastic footing been a little thicker to eliminate the base from warping up in the middl
This thing did not survive the unpacking, inserted the battery put the housing back and bent a plastic doohicky in the inside. Not worth it
THERE WAS A CRACK DOWN THE SIDE WHERE IT WAS PUT TOGETHER AND NICKS IN THE WOOD. WE DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO SEND IT BACK AND THEY ONLY OFFERED US 20.OO FOR A DISCOUNT. VERY DISSASTISFIED! WILL NEVER ORDER FORM HERE AGAI
These batteries last a long time. Cheaper batteries won't hold a charge after repeated use/charging. I have AA Energizer batteries and after a year they still hold a charge with out any problems.
I actually bought these two years ago, then again for my mother this past Christmas. We both love the sets. They're great for someone looking to start or expand their collection. The colors of the stones were very nice and equally matched. Nice size, not too small, not too big.
As a bachelor who frequently must grab a cup of joe at home and run, i was reluctant to waste coffee in my Braun drip machine, and disinclined to clean up after the French Press method.  A New York Times article convinced me that a Pod system would be the way to go, and i found the Philips Senseo machine to be the best at the consumer level.  Alas, the Douwe Egberts pods that come with are, um, IMHO, not good. ---  --- A brief web search led me to Aloha Island's Senseo-style pods, and i ordered a box of their single serving espresso pods.  The package arrived swiftly, and the box of pods was swaddled in styro-peanuts:  nice touch!  i immediately placed a pair in the Senseo unit and let it do its thing.  Wow!  The quality of the coffee is, to date, unparalled.  Rich, smooth, and frothy, almost like a latte before the milk is added.  And i was surprised that the yield was about one ounce greater than with the DE pods. ---  --- I'm a believer, an advocate, and a confirmed drinker and fan.  Thanks and Mahalo
These buds are definitely a step up from the standard iPod buds.  They stay in your ears much more easily (without the foam black covers, which are easily lost), the sound is at least marginally better, and the overall construction seems to be better.  You can't do much better for the money. ---  --- However, if you're willing to spend a little more, the JLab JBuds are the way to go.  I own both the Gumys and the JBuds, and the Gumys are my workout pair, and I use the JBuds for everything else. ---  --- But if you're looking to spend as little as possible yet still upgrade from the iPod buds, the Gumys are the way to go
I bought this for my daughter for her 11th birthday.  After playing the game once, she asked me if I could take it back.  She said that the game was boring because it was so limited as far as what you could do in the game.  My daughter has always played a lot of "simulated life" video games (i.e., the Sims, Animal Crossing) and online games (i.e, club penguin).  I suspect this is why she found this game limiting.  Other games that she has played portray a more intricate "life" and therefore draw the player in to a greater degree.  My advice would be to consider what your daughter is used to before buying this.  If your daughter has no experience in these types of games, this game will probably be fine.  However if your daughter has previously played simulated life games, she will probably find this one lacking.   
This is a great value - probably one of the best shower heads I've used. Yes - there are better ones for $100+, but this is absolutely amazing
Some long ago inventer discovered that if you place carefully shapped rocks just so they will remain in place as an arch, dramatically reducing the amount of stone you need to hold up a bridge, an aquaduct, or the entrance to a castle. It probably wasn't too much later that someone recogniced that a bunch of arches next to each other would yield an arched ceiling to a room. My guess is that it then took a very long time for someone to recognize that if you made a series of arches in a circle you could make a domed room. But as soon as one was built, I suspect that a priest of some kind looked up and immediately saw that a minature version of the sky had been created, and that an artist could transform this sky into a 'Vision of Heaven.'  ---  --- This book shows what decoration has been applied to the insides of domed buildings from about the second century to the twentieth. It is an absolutely spectacular set of photographs of how artists have brought the heavens down to earth.
So not at all what i was expecting. --- I had heard a lot of good things about this movie over the years and when i finally sat down to watch it,i was terribly disappointed and confused. --- 
I love other Preston/Childs books so I thought I would love this one.  I didn't.  It is completely predictable.  I was sure that the author would give it some interesting plot twists, but there were none.  And parts of it were ridiculous:  the length of the entombment, the amount of the treasure, the manner of transport, etc.  The only character I really liked was the monkey
I purchsed a package of these because the supermarket was out of my regular diapers and my baby is only two months and we've been trying different diapers. I was instantly disgusted by the scent when I opened the package; the diapers are scented and it doesn't say so on the package. I would never have bought them if I'd known that.  --- The worked fine for leaks and those related worries, but every time I put one on her I was irritated. I want to smell my baby, pooh incidend or not, when I pick her up. I don't want to smell the flowery perfume a corporation has added to their diapers. Shes my child, she smells, its ok
My husband has become an avid watch collector so I gave him this box for Christmas. The design of the box is as attractive as its contents. My husband says that it is easy to use too. From the looks of things I will have to get another box for his ever increasing collection
My daughter loves Strawberry Shortcake.  This interactive doll and book are uninteresting and do not work together very well.  The book has to be on a flat surface and then still does not work well.  The doll and book quickly became seperate toys and neither are played with very often
This home theater package, despite being attractively priced considering its apparent functionality, is ultimately very disappointing. ---  --- I'm new to HDTV and HDMI so I didn't know as much as I needed in order to make a fully informed decision.  I have a Sony Bravia XBR3, Oppo upconverting DVD player, Scientific Atlanta HD box and Nintendo Wii game console. ---  --- This unit only offers pass-through video, so you have to have separate video connections from the receiver to the TV for each type of input (HDMI, component, etc.).  For the price difference between this and other receivers that will convert to a single connection, you'll pay in extra cabling costs. ---  --- The HDMI on this unit carries video only - no sound - so you have to have separate cabling to carry audio from your DVD or cable to the receiver, and then from the receiver to your TV.  Again, major inconvenience and lots of additional connections. ---  --- The manual for this unit is beyond terrible.  I'm astounded that an international consumer electronics firm like Sony would provide a manual as difficult to use and just indirect as this one.  For example, there was a hum when watching TV that turned out was because the speakers while looking identical are not - some are shielded and some aren't.  Nothing in the manual about this.   ---  --- There are probably just enough HDMI and component connections for the basic user like myself. ---  --- Plus side is that there is no DVD player with this, so I can use my own. ---  --- Given a chance to do this again, I would spend a little extra on a unit that converts signals to a single output
Soft, chewy, a little grainy but a good flavor.  Mine were expired a week after I bought a whole 12 pack :(   ---  --- Don't expect whole berries.  Basically everything is ground together.  Odwalla bar is much better.  Definitely try the spirelina balls, though a little bit of a green flavor the energy/ginsing one is well worth the cost here- And NOT almost expired..
I bought this flash to use on a light pole with a flash trigger when we shoot weddings.  Rather than use one of my Canon 580's, I thought this was a better use of my $$-since I use this additional light in manual mode anyway. It does the job for under $10
I am no ladies man, but the ladies love the givenchy sent.  it is a young hip classic cologne ala DCG, Issey Miyake, etc
I bought this kitchen for my 18 mos. old and she really enjoys cooking and working in it.  It is a nice, compact size that doesn't take up too much space.  She can work at all the different stations and not get frustrated.  Another bonus for me was that it came fully assembled and ready to use straight out of the box.  My only complaint would be that the doors are somewhat difficult for my daugter to open, but I know as she gets older, it will become easier.  I would definitely recommend this kitchen to anyone who in interested in purchasing one for their child
i've been waiting for this one.this disc and this group period was funky.movin was one of the baddest instrumental jams that i've ever heard period.can you see the light is a tight jam as well.one of the many bad  groups from back in the day
Microsoft Office can be handy to have.  The files you can open, edit and create with it (most notably .doc, .xls, and .ppt) are probably the closest to universal compatibility among all your high quality options. It's (relatively) intuitive.  It has a pretty broad array of useful functions. ---  --- It's also obscenely expensive, considering the fact that you can get all of these things -- .doc, .xls, and .ppt; intuitive interface; and functionality -- for free. ---  --- I hunted up OpenOffice two years ago when I decided several hundred dollars was an insane price to pay for the ability to write papers, make basic presentations, or put together spreadsheets.  I was looking for basic functionality, but I was pleasantly surprised; OpenOffice does most of the neat tricks, too.  (Actually, it has a neat trick Microsoft can never replicate: it's open source, so it can respond to the needs of individual users.  You just say "Add this neat trick!"  and someone will likely be able to do it for you.) ---  --- It is possible that Microsoft Office has some killer feature you absolutely must have that OpenOffice doesn't.  But considering the price differential, I wouldn't splurge on this before checking. ---  --- 
I purchased this at a photographic store because a professional said you shouldn't go higher than 1.4x.  Just keep in mind--1.4x is only "40% better".  It worked really well, but didn't increase the zoomage enough.  I decided to go with a 2x (that's twice the zoomage) teleconverter by kenko instead.  I gave this one to my brother-in-law for Christmas. ---  --- You have to think about what you want--I want to get in really close to the birds.  I have a 70-300mm zoom lens and 1.4x takes it to 98-420mm.  It is an improvement, but not nearly enough!  If you want to get twice as close, this isn't going to do it for you.  If you want to get half-again-as close, this almost gets you there.   ---  --- As far as quality, the quality is definitely there. Five stars for quality, 3 for insufficient zoomage
It did what it was supposed to do, and my bras came out of the wash without any weird creases.  However, some bras hold up better in the washing machine than others, and I think the one I put into the BraBABY was one of the more durable ones.   --- While it does what it's supposed to, it definitely is not easy to use.  I had difficulty putting a B-size cup in without squishing the bra.  The clasp is also badly designed.  If it breaks, it's not a big deal to tie the outer ball closed, but the whole thing is poorly engineered.  I think it was made even harder seeing as how I tried using the BraBABY with a front-closing racer back. --- In the end, I think it would have been easier and just as effective to use a lingerie bag. --- I don't recommend this product
When I first saw this film, some five years ago, it truly knocked the breath out of me.  For the first time, director Allison Anders gives us a glimpse into Mexican-American gang life in East LA's Echo Park, from the female perspective, this time.  In the past, we have seen our share of male experiences (example being Zoot Suit, written by the playwright Luis Valdez).  For once, we see the gritty side of the gang life, as young Mexicanas (or Chicanas, depending on who you ask) struggle to stay alive, amidst rampant drug dealing, the violence of gang initiation and their relationships with men who are less than honorable to them. ---  --- Mi Vida Loca is actually a trilogy of stories.  (Mousie & Sad Girl, Lowrider and La Blue Eyes)  The first is the story of a life long friendship between fellow gang members, Mousie (Seidy Lopez) and Sad Girl (Angel Aviles).  These young women are best friends, until the day that Sad Girl sleeps with Mousie's boyfriend, Ernesto (Jacob Vargas), and becomes pregnant with his child.  The world they knew before is ruptured, as is their lifelong connection as friends.  The second story takes a glimpse in LowRider culture.  This culture is perpetuated by, predominantly, young Chicanos who build their lives around re-finishing and airbrushing "low rider" cars (many, old school Chevies), complete with flashy airbrush images (example being voluptuous women and gang affiliations), trick tires and rims.  This story is actually a wonderful example of modern magical realism, when the car takes on a life of its own.  The third story is centered around La Blue Eyes, a beautiful BROWN-EYED woman who is writing to a convict, that she falls in love with through the exchange of letters.  The question is, when they finally meet, will the sum of those letters even measure up to their encounter, or has the young woman ultimately been deceived, the whole time?   ---  --- I reccomend this film, if not for the fact that it is compelling, but that this is an important culture in society we should all learn something more about.  A very important study in gang life, and how it evolves in a neighborhood that many only hear about on the evening news, but never get to know
Whether enjoyed as a gift for others or yourself, there is something about the G collection that consistently leaves you wishing for just ONE more piece. The brown-and-lime faux-leather box, a treat for the eyes in itself, contains 15 pieces of what can only be described as Godiva's most ambitious and delicious chocolates to date. The 15-piece G Collection closely mirrors the more expensive "American Pies" collection, but provides many unique and otherwise unobtainable pieces that more than justify the cost of the set. ---  --- The rich, all-encompassing flavor of the G Collection's fruit pieces is on par with the "American Pies" collection: Key Lime and Cherry stand out, bursting from their fragile, sugar-coated shells with an intense and supremely enjoyable tang. A box of this size ought to last - one will quickly find that the richness (to overuse the word) marks these candies as individual luxuries to be enjoyed over time. Simply scarfing these down simply will not to justice to the complex, excellent job Godiva has done in blending different ingredients to make authentic, mouth-watering flavors. ---  --- Godiva's G Collection can never be explained satisfactorily until they are tried. Only on the tastebuds can an accurate and deserving review of these milestone candies be written
Goth meets Cabaret, or rather Gothic music influenced by Cabaret. Thats the best way to describe this wonderful little release by Projekt. The eleven tracks here provide an introduction to the "dark cabaret" scene, and do so quite well. The first song, Coin-Operated Boy by the Dresden Dolls, is a great start, and the CD continues onward to devious Evil Night Together by Jill Tracy (which sets up a wonderful film noir mood) and on to the darker, electronic dance number Cabaret Fortune Teller by Audra, to a remix of Knock Three Times on My Coffin by Projekt veterans Black Tape for a Blue Girl. Along the way numerous other bands are covered. ---  --- Sam Rosenthal's side project Revue Noir makes their debut on this CD, with husky feminine vocals provided by Nicki Jaine, who also has a solo song (Pretty Faces) on the CD as well. Personally, I LOVED Revue Noir and find Nicki Jaine's voice to be quite alluring, but I also know some BTfaBG fans who dislike her vocals so you've been warned. But all in all, I think anyone with a task for the dark should check out this CD. At the very least, its a cheap and decent introduction to a whole new style, and thats always a good thing
For those who have watched the movie Jaws (ask yourself, who hasn't) will know that one of many key elements that made the movie a huge success was the fantastic score John Williams did for it. This cd captures all the music from the movie perfectly, with some new elements thrown in that are not found in the film. ---  --- The linear notes are bright and colourful and provide some interesting information, which gives the overall package a nice touch. The overall cd package is certainly not a rushed effort and is worth every cent. A highly recommended purchase for those who love their soundtracks or anyone who wants to relive the film through the music
Very comfortable and durable.  I would wear these outside - although not for a long walk, but the sole is durable enough for walking to the mailbox or taking the dog for a brief jaunt.  I recommend these if you are looking for an inexpensive and durable slipper
I absolutely love the smell of Philosophy's Cinnamon Buns.  Like the other reviewers have said, it doesn't last long after the shower but it is a nice way to wake up in the morning.  Even my husband likes it and he is really picky about anything scented. ---  --- I only use it as a shower gel and not a shampoo so it lasts pretty long making it worth the expense.  I like the other Cinnamon Buns products also - I use the cream and the lip gloss
My son and I thoroughly enjoyed assembling and learning about how robots work. This kit may be frustrating for one adult or child to assemble. The screws require more 'adult strength' (he would start them and I would finish) and some of the instructions might need at least 3 hands to hold and assemble. But hey, that is why it was so enjoyable - we did it together! It is fun now to watch him play with it and tell everyone 'my Dad and I built this'
I have been very pleased with Family Handyman since receiving my first copy.  The featured articles are particularly well done.  I especially like how each project they present is well photographed and labeled.  If you want a monthly installment of ideas and guidance that will really help you learn and execute some great home improvement projects give Family Handyman a try

I am really thinking of returning it to Amazon. I think I will stick with good-'ol MS Word. You see I wanted a 12-page form and spent two days creating it. It's a form to survey boats so it also had graphic areas for photos (about 12). Well, all seemed fine until you printed a filled form to .pdf. The size of the created .pdf was near 10MB! (Similary done with MS word resulted in a 1.2MB finished .pdf). Well, I can't be e-mailing 10MB files! --- I also recieved the book for the 5.0 filler which says it can use Dragon Naturally Speaking (I use that). I'll be darned if I can figure out where that tool is, "you must activate voice recognition in the tool bar." And, if you use Dragon Naturally Speaking in the form filler area all sentences start out without capital letters, say and select does not work. (I should note that Dragon Naturally Speaking works flawlessly in MS Word!) So, you manually have to go back and capitalize each sentence. Finally, as others have said, there is no FAQ and generally no troubleshooting help on the ScanSoft web site.  This is very poor for a near $100 product. There would be no way that I would spend $700 on their premium edition.
I like the Nutiva Hemp protein. A great protein source that is easier to digest than whey and also provides half of the daily required amount of fiber.  Can't beat that!  It won't leave you feeling heavy and bloated like whey sometimes can.  I like the taste and texture too.  Mixes great with cranberry juice/cranberries, stevia, ice and water! I add some Berry Green for extra energy and nutrients!  It's my morning breakfast.
The "balls" were squeezed into the box and flattened.  The taste is not very "peanutty".  I'm disappointed
I enjoy researching various subjects simply out of intellectual curiosity and find Encarta a useful tool.  I'm somewhat overwhelmed by the multimedia offerings but like the chronological updates and appreciate this treatment of current events. 
I have had this camera since Jan '05 and have so far taken approximately 10,000 shots while on trips and at weddings.  ---  --- Don't expect much from it and you will be happy. As an entry level DSLR it does what it's supposed to do in ideal conditions. I find it's strength is in taking people photographs in bright light, provided that they are not moving.  ---  ---  --- Cons: ---  --- In landscape photography this camera is lacking - both due to inadequate megapixels and it's inability to capture the natural blues and greens very well. ---  --- Battery dies FAST. The battery I got with it hardly lasts a whole day of shooting, especially when shooting in RAW mode. I have yet to fill up a 1Gig card when shooting in RAW mode(Approx 150 shots) before the battery dies. Surprisingly when shooting jpegs, I get more shots per charge(Over 300) but hardly enough to last a day. I cannot tell you the number of times the battery has died on me while I was out on a hike. So I always carry a backup film camera (my trusty Elan 7). ---  --- The viewfinder is very dim. When I look through my Elan 7 and then through the 300D, it is painfully obvious how dark the image is through the 300D's viewfinder. In indoor situations with low light this becomes a handicap, especially when having to resort to manual focus.  ---  --- Autofocus in low light for the 300d is terrible. When shooting indoors, the autofocus hunts and ends up focusing on something behind your intended subject. I have lots of beautiful photos of walls and sconces in the background in sharp focus while the people standing in front in the middle of the frame are an out of focus blur. This is despite having a 420Ex Flash on my camera that uses an infrared beam to assist with the focus. ---  --- The 420EX flash is supposed to "talk" to the camera and adjust the power in order to ensure the subjects are not over or under exposed. However, with the 300d, this is a crap shoot at best and many of my indoor shots are over/under exposed.  ---  --- After about five months, the shutter button started sticking. I would click it and then it would remain depressed. The shutter button would only pop back up after I jiggled it a little. ---  --- Another annoying thing about the camera is that the settings are displayed on the rear of the camera and not on the top beside the shutter button. And since there is only one thumbwheel, it is not easy to change aperature and shutter speed. For example, if you use the thumbwheel to change the aperature, then to change the shutter speed you would have to press another button while at the same time turning the thumbwheel. When you take thousands of shots over the life of the camera, this is a real annoyance. ---  --- So would I recommend this camera: --- If you are a casual point and shoot person, it's an affordable entry into DSLRs that produces decent photos. But if you plan on shooting a lot indoors or want to take landscape photographs that can actually convey the colors accurately, look elsewhere
The battery works great and lasts a long time. I'd give it 5 stars if not for the cheezy cover; it falls off sometimes
These diamonds shouldn't be offered in this size for jewelry.  The imperfections in them seriously hinder the sparkling characteristics a diamond is known for.  Great price - but you get what you pay for
There are no words to describe how AWFUL (!!!) this "movie" was from beginning to end, but let me try anyway so as to give people a fair chance to avoid it and thus try and prevent their day/evening from being ruined: the film supposedly deals with a woman who has an accident and is "touched" by a sex angel only to discover she is a sex addict and the twelfth sex apostle... Need I say more? --- The plot, the "humor," the dialogues, and the music are way beyond "below average." --- There is next to no nudity and there are no, I mean 0 as in ZERO beautiful girls, in this film! --- As for the acting-oh my- the acting is beyond words... --- School plays (and pre-school for that matter) have better actors!  It is truly sad...  --- Rent or buy (ha ha ha) at your own risk.  You have been warned!
These slipcovers are tooooo expensive to fall apart after one washing!  I bought two of these;  one ripped and the other is coming apart from the inside.  I constantly have to cut the strings:-( 
If you love fashion, you need to get Vogue.  Vogue will familiarize you with designers, classic style and the fancy-schmancy side of fashion that most other magazines will not get as deep into.  However, most of what is in Vogue is way out of the average person's reach.  I, for one, could very likely not afford one thing that has ever been in a single copy of Vogue.  However, for whatever reason, the Vogue empire continues to publish this fashion tome and sell the subs for a VERY low price (usually $12 for 12 issues).  Now THAT I can afford.  It is an unbeatable deal.  Will you glean anything from it?  Yes.  You will see how the other side lives and you will see some really wonderful photography and fashion at its best.  Is it practical?  Not really but it is fun and well worth the very low price. 
awesome handling while balling on this shoe. Great grip on the court and I especially like the pump on the shoe that you press to fit the shoe to how you want it on your feet
Using this on my legs feels like electric shocks because of how it pulls and chews. I wouldn't dare use it on my underarms. Very poor shaver!!
I just love this book. It's for anyone who practices no particular "religion". The prayers are simple, in every day language, easily understood like God is speaking right to me. I find it inspiring every day and look forward to reading one prayer per day. None are more than a few paragraphs and all speak straight to the heart
very easy to follow - especially if you've used Quicken in the past. Reports are set up just a little bit different - total at top of category instead of bottom, so you need to get accustomed to that; overall great produc
I bought it for my daughter's birthday.  She says it hurts at first but really gets the kinks out.  She is very pleased with it
I am a car fanatic and have used one of these dusters on my cars for the last decade or more.  As long as the surface is dry, it works wonderfully.  Once some contaminants start to build on the paint, use the duster, then some Quick Detail with a microfiber cloth to get the paint really clean.  My cars always look new with these things.  I just traded in my 2004 RX-8 after 2.5 years of using the duster, and it still looked absolutely new.  I now use it on my 2006 Lancer Evolution and, again, the car looks brand-new (which it is).  I love them
Warning: This unit has flaws that can render it useless.  ---  --- My intention was to share my DVI monitor with my USB keyboard and mouse between my PC and Mac.  Simple enough, this unit fit the bill according to the specs.  However, as soon as I hooked everything up per the directions, the unit started beeping like crazy and would not stop.  I had to disconnect all the cabling to get it to stop as everyone in my office ran to my desk to see what the noise was all about.  Alright, 20-minutes Googling for support lead me to the conclusion that I needed to perform firmware upgrade.  WARNING: DON'T DO IT!   ---  --- Attempting a firmware upgrade on this unit from XP will most certainly render it a paperweight.  There is no fixing the unit after the firmware upgrade fails, and it will under XP.   When I tried the update I the utility reported "tramsit error."  Note the spelling on the word "transmit" - that is how Belkin spells it in the utility.   If they cannot spell correctly in a vital utility such as a firmware upgrader, what chance is there the code is quality?  Anyway, that was the kiss of death.  The unit was dead and had to be sent back for RMA.  Unacceptable! ---  --- I would not recommend this product to anyone.  It is the WORST.KVM.EVER
Great for the price vs buying it from your cell phone company
you can purchase this item at most any Walmart or K-mart ETC...for $4.99 or cheaper..toywiz is ripping people off!!!
This is a great watch for a woman!  I can't see it fitting a man and the watch face is too small for a man.  I ordered it for my sister who has a large wrist and it is perfect for her
I bought this bed for my two year old because he got too big for his crib.  He moves around A LOT in his sleep so I wanted a safe first bed for him.  He absolutely loves this bed and actually he is sleeping much better now than he was before.  The only problem was that the mattress and box spring we bought were too high, so we just use the mattress for now. Eventually we'll put the box spring back in. 
We initially discovered this cereal at one of the big warehouse stores, but they do not consistently stock it. We enjoy the flavor, the fact that it is made from organically-grown grain, and the health benefits of flax seed and high fiber. At the time of purchase, we found the Amazon price to be over a dollar cheaper per box than in our local grocery store. We bought two cases!
Sean "Puffy" Combs, Puffy Daddy, Sean John, P Diddy or Diddy.  When he figures out what he wants to be called is when I figure out if I like him.  Meanwhile, there still isn't one good DVD set for Star Wars.
I was fortunate to see this movie in a cinematic retrospective show. I had already seen and liked "Ben-Hur"`s 1959 version and was curious and keen to observe this earlier product. --- I really wasn't prepared to see such gem! If for nothing else, the sea battle scene alone merits viewing the movie. --- In some ways the story line is better developed in this film than in the more modern one, even if the acting, as in all silent films, applies some exuberance to the corporal demeanor. --- There are also a couple of surprises: some scenes are filmed in color enhancing the realism to the Passion; the chariots race is realistic in extreme and the already mentioned sea battle involves hundreds of extras. ---  --- Director Fred Niblo reached his peak; he was an experienced film maker, having conducted major actors and actresses as Rudolf Valentino, Douglas Fairbanks and Lillian Gish. He was also author of first versions of films that will be remade in the future as "The Mark of the Zorro" (1920), "The Three Musketeers" (1921) and "Blood and Sand" (1922). --- Ramon Novarro also gives his best as Judah Ben-Hur before entering his path into oblivion. Francis Bushman fleshes his Messala with a Mussolinian air and overacts a little. --- Very good film for all time cinema lovers! --- Reviewed by Max Yofre.
WHAT IT IS:  ---  --- This "Charmin Ultra Bathroom Tissue" is very soft, absorbent, long lasting, and a terrific value. The shortcomings of the Scott's standard mainstay, roughness, are not a concern here. "Charmin Ultra" is nearly perfect in every way.  ---  --- The NEW "Gold Standard" for the bathroom, arguably has become "Charmin Ultra" especially if your needs require a softer tissue than the Scott's. Scott's standard bathroom tissue is stronger than Charmin Ultra, but "Charmin Ultra's" strength is ample for the intended use of the product. The 2-ply construction makes the 200 sheet rolls go much farther than one might expect and does add body and mass to the product. Add to this the extra absorbency of "Charmin Ultra" over Scott's, and I would say that "Charmin Ultra" has a clear edge.  ---  --- THE BOTTOM LINE:  ---  --- Basically, these two products compare much like "Bounty" versus "Viva" paper towels. While both products score high marks in every area there are significant differences. Bounty is stonger and Viva is softer, making both choices excellent but dependent on the needs of the individual consumer.  ---  --- RESULTS OF OUR IN-HOUSE TRIAL BETWEEN THIS CHARMIN & "SCOTT EXTRA SOFT":  ---  --- We compared "Charmin Ultra" to "Scott Super-Soft" in what turned out to be a NO-Contest event. The "Charmin Ultra" is much softer than the "Scott Extra-Soft", though the "Scott Extra-Soft" is an improvement over their standard product, but still quite rough.  ---  ---  ---  --- [I am not affiliated with any product or company.]  ---  ---  --- 
...this movie is a dud. Who'd have thought that John Wayne and the director of "Support Your Local Sherrif" would have joined forces for this stinker! ---  --- The characterization hints at being good, but really its character actors doing what they do best - being good support characters. Its a good thing to because the Duke really just mailed this one  in. ---  --- First - what this movie does well: ---  --- -Ann Margaret is good and she looks great dressed up like a cowboy. ---  --- -the supporting cowboy characters literally steal the show. ---  --- -it is interesting that the bad guys chasing Ann Margaret and John Wayne and his cast of cronies are never ever seen close up until the very end. When you get to the end, you learn why, but it works well to keep them faceless. ---  --- -the last 10 minutes is good - top notch with a twister of an ending. ---  --- HOWEVER, what is wrong with the movie is stronger than what is right: ---  --- -John Wayne is absolutely uninspired - he is just a cardboard version of himself - a cranky, mean man who they rarely even try to develop as a character - and when they do, it seems very, very clunky. ---  --- -At least 20 minutes of this movie consists of long-distance shots of people riding horses. Sometimes, they ride over hills, sometimes they ride through valleys. We get 4 separate long shots of them crossing a wide pond that is supposed to be the Rio Grande (the border with Mexico). Fill in this time with some character development! Some dialogue! Anything! ---  --- -the character actors keep referring to other events in the past that sound a lot more interesting than this movie. ---  --- All in all, it seems like this was the rough draft of a great script that was rushed to film just so John Wayne could have another movie in the theaters. Too bad, a crack team of writers could have made it something special. ---  --- My suggestion, get "Cowboys" or either of the two "Rooster Cogburn" movies or "Support Your Local Sherrif" and see this actor and this director doing much better work!
I bought this as a gift for my Mother and she absolutely loves it! Definitely a good buy
No one alive today cares that NY had fires in 1741 (UNLIKE THE CHICAGO fIRE OF 1871). Why did author Lepore choose to bring up this terrible racial incident. Is she trying to create trouble? Be a traitor to her own race? Book is well researched I guess --- but the racial subject matter stinks and was unnecessary to bring up! Totally unnecessary!
Hey if you have all seen the works of Argento and Fulci then you probably understand how illogical GIALLO is. This was not always the case and some of them come across as quite alright in the end. I would actually recommend this Argento 'primative slasher' over Fulci's "Don't Torture a Duckling" - not anywhere near as good as its GIALLO hype, this version of The Bird With the Crystal Plumage I watched was uncut and a lot more violent than the PG version that has less murder violence, but is still dark all the same. Although I give this five stars, it is more of a three star movie, but this is the one that started a whole cult wave of stuff like this, and for that it is recognized and prized, but you have seen better Argento and GIALLO, I recommend that you get SUSPERIA before this. I say stay away from "Don't Torture a Duckling"
If you like the Beach Boys and appreciate the technical quality behind Telarc recordings, then this disc is a must have in your collection. First, Papa Doo Run Run does an excellent job covering Beach Boys tunes to the point where some people can't tell the difference, but you can still hear the uniqueness they bring to it. Second, you'll feel like your hearing parts of the music you've never heard before because there is so much more foundation and clarity to the recording. You can hear each instrument clearly. The beginning of "I Get Around" is almost explosive, they way the original recording should have been. Telarc and Papa Doo Run Run have made a special album here. When I feel like listening to the Beach Boys, I usually grab this CD first
I bought some less than a week ago. I've been using it over my brows, between my eyes and under my eyes (although the directions say not to). Already the fine lines under my eyes have decreased dramatically. ---  --- I love the tingly feel of it as well. It's super expensive here in Canada ($200 a tube), but so far, it's worth the price. I'd definately buy it again
I am a Jane Austen fan. I love Pride and Prejudice and there are three very good to marvelous adaptations of that great novel. However, Mansfield Park is Jane Austen's most complex and serious novel, and on the whole it is my favorite. Fanny Price is the most difficult of the Jane Austen heroines, not the wittiest or most beautiful, but the one who knows the difference between right and wrong. She is mentored by her uncle, the righteous and honorable [and I don't use the terms loosely] Sir Thomas Bertram. Somehow, the adaptation of this great novel has twisted Sir Thomas into a sadistic, sexual pervert. Moreover, Fanny is constantly babbling to us in Jane Austen quips that are not part of this novel. They simply missed the point of the book. ---  --- The acting is okay. The settings are okay. The directing is sad. But the sense of disappointment and betrayal by perverting the essential theme of the book has left a very sour taste
If you adore the intellect and see in it the only way to the highest, purest, and most divine knowledge, than this is your book--but it isn't mine.  Page after page of speculation about the higher realms open only to  a mind freed from the crude considerations of the flesh....I kept hoping  that Plotinus would realize his vision and disappear before finishing, but  it didn't happen
I bought this for my aged Mom after she confessed that the big plush expensive terry towel I'd bought her was just too heavy for her to handle.  She *adores* the microfiber towels I got her!  They are light for her weak arms, they are so very absorbent that one or two passes gets her dry and that's particularly important with the delicate skin of the elderly.  Not to mention that I, a hearty creature in my prime, love these towels too! I shall be buying more of various styles and colors
I find these ear buds to be absolutely uncomfortable. I would rate the product a zero if it were an option. I can't even use them because they're too uncomfortable to wear. Not worth the money, even though they're cheap
I bought this for a woman who is a small size eight, one of those people who is just a touch too big to wear a size six, and normal medium sized clothes usually run very loose.  Not this tiny shirt. It looked all right when she opened the package, but when she wore it, it made the kid look as if she had flub.  It was inexpensive enough that I won't bother returning it, but the item, although well made, was sized so small as to be useles
This thing is terrible. It only caught a few unlucky moths who accidentally got stuck inside. Meanwhile, mosquitoes were everywhere not getting caught in the catcher
As others experienced, both packs each had two dead batteries in them. I am even using the Juice Family Charger, so it isn't a brand problem.  The packaging was a little beat up as well as if they were sitting around for a long time.  Sort of dirty. Also purchased D batteries as well and that packaging was worse.   ---  --- Hard to knock the fact they are made in China because let's admit it, pretty much everything you buy is made in China. The problem is the poor quality control from the company Juice Battery themselves.  These are actually ok batteries if they work, but not worth the price especially when taking the chance on whether they will arrive beat up or DOA. ---  --- Even though still most likely made in China, stick to the main well-known brands insread of this junk
The are pretty comfy and definitly help out your hands and wrists during workouts. Unfortunatly, the wear out pretty easily a the seams. I saw them cheaper at Hibbets after I ordered them from here. Oh well, only like a three dollar difference. I'll know next time when I get another pair in about two months
I received emails about delaying my order three times. Since it showed that the product was available, I didn't understand why I had to wait less than two months to get my order. I was so disappointed by the Amazon this time! Doing business like that, I am not sure how long you will survive
It worked for barely 24 hours.  On the second day many of the segments that make up the numbers disappeared, making it useless
Thanks ! ---  I  DON'T HAVE  ANY PROBLEM ! ---    I"LL  CONTINUE MAKE DEAL WITH  YOU  --- 
I was a bit afraid after reading the reviews, but this game is a hit with kids all ages. It takes about 3 minutes to set up, but it's not hard and the bees don't fall thru. We played more times than I can count this past week, and everyone enjoyed. I bought it for my 5 year old, but her cousins (ages 19, 17 and 13yo) joined in the fun and actually asked to play. My husband and I also got a kick out of it! Even our 3yo loved it, but she is incredibly lucky and would just pull randomly at leaves and none dropped, she's good! ---  --- Our child didn't get bored while we were setting it back up, but everyone was sticking leaves and talking, so I guess it depends on your children's patience or attention span. ---  --- In a few words: We all loved it
I've used my smoker for 7 years now and I have nothing but great things to say about it. One recomendation is to drill a small hole in the top and insert a metal stem thermometer (about $7) for accurate monitoring of the smoking. You'll get the best results when you can hold the temps at the desired levels. It also comes in handy for checking internal temps of the meat. ---  --- After 7 years, the heating element broke and new ones are $40 through Char Broil. I'm appalled that they're so much, and am contemplating buying another smoker instead.
This is a sweet treat!  It smells good enough to eat.  It also leaves my skin smooth and soft.  It works good as a shampoo on my thick, wavy hair too.  Cinnamon Buns 3-in-1 is a wonderful product and everyone should buy it.  Totally worth the $dough$.  Ha Ha
Silver Needle White Tea is the finest tea I have ever tasted.  The flavor is delicate without being weak and there is no bitter aftertaste as with the majority of teas.  Because there is less caffiene, I did not experience the jittery, nauseous feeling I get from other teas.
This contains no corn.  Whoo Hooo.  Finally I can have vanilla bean extract with no alcohol derived from corn or corn syrup.  Corn takes away from the flavor of natural vanilla.  This is the best vanilla extract out there.  You have to try it
The Lamy Safari is an excellent pen: light, sturdy, attractive design that lets you monitor your level of ink.  It's great if you like thick pens (I don't, but people do), and I should have gotten the fine tip rather than medium because I can empty a cartridge in eight pages of free-flowing ink. ---  --- On the other hand, it's a great pen if you're stuck with a bunch of cartridges that come from your checkered past: the sales rep says it can only handle Lamy-proprietary ink cartridges, but that's nonsense.  Mine goes through Parker and Cross cartridges like nobody's business, with nary a mishap
As curious as I was about this movie it had me dazed. The 'Good Shepherd' always struck me symbol for Christianity. Shepherds look after their flocks so the sheep can be killed and eaten. What's good about that? Fortunately, sheep don't have the intelligence to be paranoid. With Bourne Identity movies under his belt, Matt Damon has a good pedigree to play spy movies. Is this one a killer or dead on arrival? With a budget of $85m, we've got Oscar-winning actors, writers, cinematographers, and more stars than flocks by night ever get to see. Pet project of actor-turning-director, Robert De Niro, "The Good Shepherd" tells a story of the CIA from its early days, weighing in at just under three hours. The scene before the opening credits is the one which the whole movie revolves around once that's miss you won't get it. This is a shame, because it's a tantalisingly mysterious and artistically shot. ---  --- This movie is told from Damon's point of view, its scope is epic, and covering the years from 1939 before the CIA was even a speck in President Truman's eye, to 1961 and the Bay of Pigs. We see the founding years, the London Blitz, post-war reconstruction in Berlin, and increasingly intricate machinations as the Cold War gathers pace. Angelina Jolie doesn't feature in much of the movie, but when she does, she' get into character very well. It's enough to make you wish she would put down her excellent humanitarian work long enough to take on more of the challenging parts for which is so eminently capable.  ---  --- Robert de Niro (got to love him), in the director's chair, is sadly the weakest link. Although he handles it professionally, almost magisterially, he lacks the experience to slowly build momentum, convey gradual moral decay, or make this the Godfather standard-bearer of CIA films. He's done a fine job - just bitten off a bit more than he can chew. What he deserves credit for is attempting a classic depiction of one of the world's most important institutions and pulling it off with considerable dignity; if not quite the artistic flourish that he would have aspired to, given that his mentors are people like Francis Ford Coppola (who is the executive producer). With sufficient dedication, it is easy to imagine De Niro pulling off an Oscar for direction in a future film: his grasp is very broad, and all it needs is a little tweaking.
First point, thankfully this wasn't directed by good 'ole George.  The setting of the game is 4,000 years before the Star Wars: A New Hope, and a few years after the devastating Mandolorian Wars.  This a truly fun Role-Playing Game (RPG) including interesting characters- everone of them with unique histories (including yours), an almost flawless turn-based combat system, a sinister universe dominating villian, ect.  At this point, the graphics aren't the greatest, but are still nothing to scoff at.  There are some bugs with the dialogue and movies, but nothing serious.  The music, produced by the gaming-world famous Jeremy Soule is amazing and completely allows the player to become immersed with gameplay.  Basically, every action (mostly dialogue) has a good (Light Side), Neutral, and bad (Dark Side) outcome.  For some reason, the dark side way of going about things is more fullfilling....  Many movie seen force powers (lightning, force choke) as well as some powers known to Knights of the Old Republic (KOTOR) are included keeping you on your toes while playing.  *Spoiler Alert* Incredilby (it is a small universe) all of the characters you meet that become apart of your party have to do with your past self. *Over*  At two parts of your journey, once in the begining and once more a fourth of the way in, the player gets to choose the class of his/her character.  First time around, what kind of grunt of the Old Republic's are you? and second, what kind of SUPER-ALL-POWERFUL-KICK-A**-BITE-YOUR-HEAD-OFF Jedi are you? ---  --- One of the best XBox games ever. period. and one of the better RPGs out there as well
I purchased this item as a gift for my mother.  She has a huge outdoor swimming pool and will use it as a changing room for all of her grandkids.  She's very happy that her new floors won't be ruined by everyone coming inside dripping wet to change after swimming
These boxes are half the size of regular cases, just right--not too bulky like the regular ones
Tediously long and weary. Nothing interesting, just a lot of borrowed ideas from RTCW, HL2, etc. I am sick of this
This is a great portable grill for the size. The 14" one would be fine for 1-2 people, but not more. This grill can handle more charcoal and has enough room to allow for 2 heat zones.  --- The hardest part is finding one! I finally found one on eBay but, you better hurry!
I still have a LOT of learning to do, but just what I've been able to do with photos the last 2 weeks is amazing.  I don't know why I waited so long to buy this thing
SCRUBS has been a model of consistency in its five seasons--and to interrupt myself, why aren't we anticipating Season Five instead of Season Four? And boo! on them for being so slow to bring the show out on DVD!--and Season Four is no exception. I recently rewatched Seasons 1 through 3 on DVD with my daughter and it really brought home just how great this series has been from the very beginning to the present. If you visit boards there are always prognosticators who declare that it isn't as good as it used to be, but I would be dishonest if I said that I detected any decline. One thing I've really enjoyed is that unlike situation comedies, this one really does have an overall story arc, and I really appreciate Bill Lawrence and Co. taking the time to reward fans of the show in this way.  ---  --- The story in Season Four revolves largely around the very, very gradual repair of the friendship between JD and Elliott. Fans of the show know that at the end of Season Three JD, utterly smitten by Elliott, had expressed his love for her, causing her to break off her relationship with her boyfriend to be with JD. No sooner had he done this, however, he once again felt trapped and almost immediately broke things off with her. Season Four opens with her filled with hatred of him, complicated by the fact that she and he are named co-chief residents (though there is wonderful confusion over the fact that the name plate on her door reads--thanks to Janitor--"Chief Resident" and his misleadingly reads "Co-Chief Resident," causing many to imagine that she is over him). Some of my favorite visuals in the series are of JD and Elliott wedged into their ultra tiny office, barely large enough for the desk they face each other across. Of course, eventually they patch things up, but for the first season have no kind of romantic entanglement. Given the intensity of the events of the ends of Season Three, any sort of getting together would certainly have ended with Elliott murdering JD. The season ends with Carla and Turk urging JD to move out and get a place of his own, which leads to an interesting roommate situation in Season Five.  ---  --- Season Four continued the SCRUBS tradition of having some very high profile guest stars. This was marred somewhat by having the absolutely dreadful Colin Farrell on one episode, an episode through which he drifted as if completely drunk or totally bored (there have been very few bad episodes of SCRUBS, but this episode ranks near the bottom). The always delightful Heather Graham sparkled through several episodes earlier in the season. Matthew Perry stopped by for an episode less interesting for his presence than for his being teamed with his father, Jonathan Bennett Perry, a country singer best known to most people as the Old Spice sailor. Tara Reid puts in another appearance as JD's terrible sometimes girlfriend while Molly Shannon is in another episode. And Julianna Margulies of ER appears in a couple of episodes.  ---  --- The great tragedy with SCRUBS is that it remains something of a secret. The only comedy better than SCRUBS in the past few years has been ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT (most fans of one show tend to be a fan of the other as well, and the lead of each show appeared on the other, Zach Braff as the producer of the GIRLS WITH LOW SELF-ESTEEM series of videos on AR and Jason Bateman as a patient on SCRUBS) and while it won a large number of awards, its ratings were worse than SCRUBS. This show has decent ratings, but shockingly few awards. How terrible shows like EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND and the formerly good but now dull WILL AND GRACE beat it out for awards is mystifying. And how did it manage only one Emmy nomination? It was nominated for Best Comedy Series, but why wasn't Zach Braff nominated for Best Comic Actor and John C. McGinley and Donald Faison for Best Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series and Sarah Chalke for Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series? How is that possible? Much ink has been spilt on how the 2006 Emmy nominations have made less sense than any in memory (Lauren Graham yet again not nominated, though clearly the best comic actress on TV for at least five years and five vastly less talented women were nominated instead of her; LOST not nominated; no nominations for VERONICA MARS; Jason Lee not nominated for MY NAME IS EARL; neither Michael Chiklis, Hugh Laurie, nor James Gandolofini nominated for Best Actor, while Martin Sheen who was barely appeared in this year's WEST WING; while shows way, way, way, way past their prime like WILL AND GRACE and THE WEST WING nominated; and the list goes on) but Zach Braff's failure to be nominated while Charlie Sheen and Kevin James did is just one more reason not to take the Emmys seriously at all. At least the Golden Globes more or else get it right.  ---  --- Anyway, awards aside, and armed with the knowledge that the best shows are usually neglected by the Emmys (how many Emmy nods did BUFFY get despite most of the nation's best TV critics passionately begging each year for it to get the recognition it deserved), fans of the show will be delighted with Season Four and if you aren't a fan, you should be. But don't start with Season Four. Go back and do it right. Either buy or rent (I recommend buying--you'll want to watch this more than once) Season One, then work your way forward. Many pleasurable hours will result
First off, I usually just stick to rating & critiquing movies. But, every time I see an ad on this website for this Time/Warner (or whatever the hell the company calls itself this week) rag-mag I start to see red. ---  --- "Entertainment Weekly", which was once an interesting weekly deluge from the ho-hum of everyday life, has become just another rag crapped out weekly to stand on newstands week after week prostituting for your hard earned cash.    ---  --- Back in the summer of 89, "EW" was released and after I read a few issues, I decided to subscribe. I was instantly hooked (the new issue would arrive in my mailbox the Saturday before it would hit regular newstands) & I liked getting the latest news and reviews from movies, music, T.V., and video (that was later added in the mid-90's).  ---  --- The problem with the magazine started in the late 90's. I started to notice that "EW" would cover a big movie or event that hadn't yet been released and then the following week bash the hell out of it, or try to get some piece of dirt on it in order to generate more sales.  ---  --- I also hate the damn lists that "EW" comes up with. The latest entitled "The top 100 most memorable movie lines" was a joke. These lists have always annoyed me, because I feel they are truly not thought out and therefore not thought provoking. ---  --- The other & most important thing I noticed was the absolute lack of an honest review.  ---  --- Case in point, a few weeks ago I picked up the latest issue in which the movie "Catwoman" had been reviewed (I wasn't to sure if it was Gleiberman or Shwarzbaum that critiqued it).  ---  --- I first logged onto "Rotten Tomatoes.com" to see what percentile "Catwoman" recieved from the nation's critics.  --- Out of roughly 115 reviews "Catwoman" only got 10% of the good reviews while the rest trashed it (a film needs, at least, to get a grade of 60 - 65% in order to place it as a fresh or good movie). That makes "Catwoman" the worst reviewed film, so far, for 2004. Yet, "EW" gave the film a B. What erkes me even more is that "Catwoman" is released by "Warner Bros.", the same company that owns the rights to the "Harry Potter" films, "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy, & yes, the "WB" owns "Entertainment Weekly".  ---  --- Is "Warner Bros." trying to bribe or threaten its own critics at one of its most popular & lucrative magazine's?        ---  --- I'm not the only who has seen this developement. People have written in saying that there is favoritism among "Warner" products that are reviewed in the magazine. "EW", of course, hotly denies anything of the kind thumping there chests and standing behind there reviews, possibly in fear of being fired (they will deny that also). ---  --- My only question to the reviewers at "Entertainment Weekly" is, "Whats it like to stand in your own pile of bull**it?"  ---  --- Or better yet, "What's it like to stand on a Democratic Podium?"
 ---  ---  --- The crystal light iced tea brand tastes better than all the regular sugared, as well as, the low-calorie sweetened teas.If you like it a bit sweeter, put an extra pack of splenda in it

How would you like to have to perform your own autopsy? That is the conundrum that faces Dr. Maura Isles in Body Double when she returns from a conference in France to find that the identical twin she never knew she had has been murdered in front of her house. The investigation into the murder leads Maura to a mental institution to confront the woman who gave the identical twins up for adoption 40 years before, and also leads Maura into the chilling discovery that a serial killer has been murderng pregnant women. ---  --- This book moves quickly as Maura follows the investigation to its very surprising conclusion. It's a pleasure to see Maura team up with Dr. Jane Rizzoli-- Maura seems to take some of the hard edges off of Jane and Jane seems to make Maura a little less of an ice princess. This is an enjoyable book that you will find is hard to put down until the end
What a great game! My 4 year old loves the disney princess. It is such a great educational toy. We love it
This is the one you give to someone you love. The wonderful rose scent is very light, not overpowering at all. And the pretty little dried rosebuds are so charming. I love lying in the tub with those rosebuds floating around me. It makes me feel like I'm lying in a beautiful garden
Got this camera for my wife - a digital novice - during Christmas 2005. Camera is easy to use and takes good pictures. Easily interfaces with PC through USB. However, I also (as did another reviewer) started having problems after about 11 months. Camera would not take pictures as the CCD went bad. Luckily I had an extended service contract and it was repaired. Unfortunately, it just quit working again (April 2007) and the service contract company says they "...won't bother fixing it again..." and is refunding my purchase price. Gracious but a hassle doing without a camera for a second time. Good camera but if you buy one make sure you get the service contract
I bought the ear buds to replace the ones that came with my iPod. I used it for about fifteen minutes and then the left earbud would not transmit any sound. Sending these ones back. I must say that the earbuds kept outside sound out very well (Much to my Mom's dismay, she couldn't fuss at me :-P ). Oh well.
Systemworks continues to grow, taking ore hard drive space and messing with more stuff on your computer, and I'm likely to buy an alternative next time I update.  Note it stops working entirely if you install upgrades to your computer - a new hard drive, motherboard, or processor and Symantec requires you to spend a fortune on another copy.  I like the basic functions, but there's too much baggage to recommend this product anymore
It was a nice looking razor but it didn't work and I had to send it back for credit. I bought another one locally and had trouble with it also. I wonder if the 5200 just doesn't have to many bells & whistles. I finally bought a 5100 it's a plain Jane but is working great
This collection of poems, tho representing a fine breadth of Dickenson's works, is in final assessment a crime against the poet's great talent.  As is freely admitted in the introduction, the editor, Mr. Higginson, "worked on the mechanics of the poems by smoothing out the rhymes and meter, changing the line arrangements, and rewriting the dialect of the local area."  This is a free admission of the book's guilt, having adulterated Dickenson's original poems in both content and form.  Gone are the nuances and passions that make Dickenson one of the best American writers.  Gone are the premeditated dashed and capitalizations that add depth and intensity to the poems' meanings.  And, worst of all, gone or altered are many lines that contribute to the unique vision of the artist.  As Thomas H. Johnson says in the Introduction to "The Complete Poems of Emily Dickenson," A representative mid-nineteenth century traditionalist was being asked to judge the work of a wholly new order of craftsman . . . which he was not equipped to estimate."  Do yourself a favor and avoid this text.  Instead, find one that is true to the original poems, one which preserves the intent and stylistic genius of the author, and one which will give you the full and lasting effect of Emily Dickenson
Great leggings....I love the feel of these....thicker than the regular cotton/lycra leggings and they hold you in nicely.....One thing I like about Danskin is the waist elastic is not tight, it just rests on your waist. It's extremely comfortable. Gusseted cotton crotch is also a plus...I wear these to yoga, pilates, on hikes with my dog and just about everywhere else. Oh, and they look much more expensive than the cotton leggings......I even wear them in 90 degree weather. I just can't get enough of them......I have always appreciated Danskin quality, just machine wash and dry and off you go....
The Barbie Plug and Play 12 Dancing Princesses thing is a joke.  My daughter only wanted that for Christmas for three months.  After the one on Christmas morning did not function at all, the second one was so terrible that she gave up after two days.  The graphics are straight from 1981 and the "dancing princesses" even make roboty bendy noises as they move.  Very strange and disappointing
The only reason that I am writing this review is because I am on line now looking for a new trimmer.  I bought this "gem" less than a year ago and was not satisfied then.  Tonight, I'm trying to trim my goatee and it is ripping and pulling the hair out.  The extra cutting heads are all but worthless.  I would never recommend this P.O.S to anybody. --- I wish I could give it 0 stars
Picture quality sucks for the price. Colors are way freaky. The screen is perfect for text but not for pictures. Viewing pictures on this is terrible. Keyboard is ackward at first. The manual needs to be much more detailed. Sorta confusing to use if not familliar with palm pilots. I expected to use it like a typical pilot, where you write on the screen. This feature is not implemented.  Overall, this is a very good phone. Good reception, great sound quality!! Speakerphone is great! Neat features. Worth the $$
I originally bought the Edit 120 (no detachable case) but was looking for a separate bag in which to keep the cables that are not used often (to leave at home).  Then I came across the Edit 120+ with the detachable case which fit the bill exactly.  Not haven actually seen the detachable bag yet, I was somewhat concerned about the method/design of the atachment.  It needed to be easy to remove, but it also needed to be secure; the pictures I found on the internet didn't show how it was attached.   ---  --- I was relieved when I actually saw how it was attached.  There is a slotted bottom on the main bag the entire length of the bag (an open slot is at each end).  The add-on bag has a wide semi-rigid flap that slides through the slotted bottom and a fold down tab on the free end that is secured by velcro.  The attachment method is secure and is almost invisable, and the design compliments the aesthetics of the original bag.  I think the original bag is very good, and the add-on detachable bag makes this a superb choice.   ---  --- Unfortunately, you have to buy this as a combination.  If you originally bought the 120 single bag version, it doesn't have the slotted bottom on it and can't be retrofitted (and I don't think they sell the detachable bag separately)
My daughter plays with this toy at Grandma's house. Theses "instruments" are usually the first toys she pulls out to play with. The bright colors and different noises definitely interest her. She loves to shake them and make noise. They are great little toys to throw in the diaper bag when you're on the go
I love my fisher-price infant toddler swing.  I have two of them for my twin boys.  They love it and I know it is safe.  Also is it easy to get them in and out of. ---  --- lynne Ambros
I have had this for a couple years now and recommend it to anyone
t may be expresso grind, but if you are expecting lovely dark aromatic coffee for your espresso maker: think again. Bitter when drunk on own. Marginally better when combined with milk in cappuchino. I shoulda known betta
I have purchased Lentek Bite Shield because it is the only product  I was able to find, that works on the same principle as european mosquito repellents I am used to. I needed it for my daughter's bedroom so I couldn't use any type of candles for the safety reasons and I didn't want to use anything that rubbs directly on the skin since she has extremely sensitive skin. Lentek Bite Shild seems to work pretty well, she got bitten only once - the night I forgot to turn it on. Now I plan to buy the adapter to plug it in the outlet. That way I would be sure that the batteries wouldn't die in the middle of the night. 
I was honestly expecting some cheap necklace that felt like plastic, considering the price.  I was so very wrong! The necklace is gorgeous! The clasp is sturdy and not easy broke.  Package it was mailed in was also very good. I am able to Christmas wrap it in the package provided.  Excellent service.  THANK YOU!!
I do not do much printing, but the ink ran low after a very short time. It did not last as long as it normally does when I purchase it at an office supply store. I wondered if it had dried out
I only occasionally feed my baby, and my apartment doesn't have a dishwasher. I usually decide right before going out that I want to take a bottle, so this disinfects everything really quick - in 3 minutes. As opposed to boiling it in a pot of water for 20 minutes. ANd I don't use it every days, so I don't see the point in keeping everything sterlized cuz I would have to sterilize it again right before using.
I'm wearing it at the moment. it's lasted this long I don't know why people complaining about. if people wanted a nightvision face for a peice of 18th Century tech. they should just buy a Seiko. Its great for it's sole funtionality which is to look pretty in dance halls. you buy it to get stares guys; or dare I let you do this but; let your "Girlfriends" buy it for you
The transfer is real real bad, the story is also weird but its o
The four tales in this collection are beautifully composed; they are art, not just stories.  Each story is deep in its unique complexities.  Each one has plots and subplots and paints an impeccable image of the story upon the reader's mind.  And when I look back upon the book as a whole, upon the adventurous stories, the excitement and emotion that the author presents so exquisitely, I can't help but be extremely impressed.
i liked the book it was good but not as i expected, i needed more explanation before buying the book, like how the book will look like from the inside ,  --- anyhow in general its good  --- Thank you Amazo
There is no doubt that this tea does it's job, but the smell of it is awful. I normally don't have any problems eating or drinking mildly offensive things, but I have such an aversion to the smell of this tea. It has a top note of moldy, dank earth with a base note of acrid peppers gone bad. The box says that it contains "delicious sasparilla". I don't taste anything like sasparilla or rootbeer in it at all. If you can bear the smell and aftertaste then go for it
great iron and its purple! heats up fast, stays hot, variable hotness levels..great i own this and the next size up and love them both
I have been a user since version 4. Version 4 was bad, 5 was good, 6 was terrible, 7 was great, tried 8 & didn't see the point, 9 was stable and very good. I avoided 10. 11 is very good. In Version 12 Corel had added features that made me want to go back to 11.  ---  --- So now here we are on X3.  Let me tell you, It has been 5 years since could say I love this program! It loads faster than 11 or 12 (and about a bizillion times faster than Adobe's Illustrator).  ---  --- It seems in this version, Corel has really given it's users a good listen because the additions to this program bring draw up to a new level of "I can harldy wait to work on a new project". ---  ---  Many of the improvments are simply little things in the way of navigation and shortcuts. Some, like the improved trace work wonderfully and seamlessly. You can go to corel's website to learn of the other improvments. I think you'll be pleased.   ---  --- This is a designer's tool that you can purchase and use with confidence.
For a plot synopsis please read the Amazon review. I wish to talk about the reasons why you will love this film. ---  --- As a longtime fan of both Sam Raimi (of the Evil Dead series) and Bill Paxton (Aliens, Twister), I went to see this on opening night. Not many people can claim this I'm sure because it was and is, such a small film that received next to no marketing. For shame. ---  --- This film is in the best tradition of modern film noir including BLOOD SIMPLE and FARGO, both made by the Cohen brothers. Film buffs will be able to draw the connections to those films and their filmakers, so I won't bother to get into that. Should you have seen either of these films and enjoyed them, I suggest you stop reading and immediately rent A SIMPLE PLAN. If not, keep reading and I will try to express why this film is so remarkably brilliant. And why I hope you will take a look at it. ---  --- A SIMPLE PLAN is, at its core, about four people. And underneath all the plot devices and twists, it's about how they relate to one another. Notice I did't say characters, because this film doesn't have actors simply delivering dialogue. It's about people you get to know, understand and sympathise with as they undergo the most brutal of dilemmas. Sure, finding a mysterious bag filled with money is an excellent plot device, but the heart of this film is much simpler than that. It's about the basic human flaw of committing a criminal act and trying to weasel your way out of it. And being forced to do the most unthinkable things in the process. ---  --- That's what gives this film such depth. You watch these people try to figure out how to cover every angle so they can get away with stealing a whole lot of cash. And in the end it falls apart for two reasons: the details and the human factor. They say the Devil is in the details and this is never truer than with a crime. As for the human factor, where greed is concerned, people cannot trust one another because they fear the other person's greed while are unable satisfy their own. ---  --- In many respects this film is almost an homage to BLOOD SIMPLE and FARGO, but in many ways I think it is superior. I often draw the comparison by a scene which is both A SIMPLE PLAN and BLOOD SIMPLE where a body is increasingly difficult to dispose of. And even afterwards, after the emotional toll the has been taken, once one evil act is committed, another is sure to follow. It's so painfully facsinating to watch a person work out their problem on camera, frantically going over the details in their mind, all the while their heart is beating a mile a minute. Bill Paxton does this better than anyone. He is such a likable man (both in the film and in life) that you can't help but feel sorry for the mess he has created. His entire performance is a balancing act between getting away with a seemingly harmless crime, keeping his partners at bay and their mouths shut while being prodded along by his conspirator wife. That may make them all sound malicious, but really the opposite is actually true. They're all normal folks, like we've all seen a hundred times. And in the end it really gets to you because you can imagine how you would react in the same situations they find themselves in.  ---  --- After all, were you faced with the choice to steal a couple million dollars that no one would miss, what would you do?  --- But then again, nothing is ever that simple
This Omron Blood Pressure Monitor is OK, but not as good, in my opinion as my old one from the same company.  This one doesn't print out results, although it does store them.  Also, the cuff is very stiff and cumbersome. 
This brand is just awful!  It's made of cheap, flimsy particle board.  It dents and dings very easily.  Most inportantly, the runners are too narrow for the wheels so the drawers fall out.  Not only is it horribly made, but it's dangerous!  DO NOT BUY!
Far from user-friendly, you will be at the office later at night tearing out your hair trying to find the buttons on the tool bar for even the simplest of office tasks, wondering "Why did I get this program again?" Its like reading another language after using previous editions of Word, which I was a big fan of. I guess with some extensive getting used to the it might be nice but for now it's a nuisance. I can't find anything on this toold bar that looks like an airplane cockpit. In the words of Thoreau "Simplify." --- Good luck sending files as attachments to colleagues-they won't be able to view the newere version. Get used to saving in "97-2003 Word Format." Also, won't comply with other programs such as e-fax unless saved in this manner. At this price, you could do without the headache.
This product is great for those meals when you have no time or patience for a larger meal plan, and it is so handy for any camping or trips where vegetarian food may be scarce.  It can be added to any rice or noodle dish, or eaten plain with vegetables.  The taste is pleasing.
I bought 8 size D's for my boom box thinking it would be the answer to having to buy batteries every few camping trips.  Wrong answer.  I was able to play 2 1/2 CDs before my box was out of juice.  Game over.  I realize these batteries lose their charge quickly by sitting around, but these batteries were fresh off the charger when I left.  I figured they'd at least last into the night, but they were finished before sundown.  Don't believe anyone who says these are for high drain devices...  I got fooled.  Fool me once, shame on you.  We can't get fooled again
Bought 2 of these.  Both failed at extactly the same time after a few months.  Save your money
i read this years after i'd read catcher in the rye and nine stories and it was cool to be reading salinger again but it wasn't as rewarding as the first two books were. maybe i let too much time pass and outgrew his style. i dunno. i felt as if i was reading a magazine story and not a book story. i still would read everything he wrote tho if he released all new stuff, j.d. salinger's the man
I bought another of Clark's sandals a few years ago, which is why I ordered them again. These sandals were even more comfortable than the last pair! There was no break-in period with these shoes..I just put them on and spent the day in them without pressure points or blisters. I will buy more in other colors I'm sure. You can't go wrong with Clark's
This woman may have a great body, but she cannot teach dancing for anything. In the 35 minute 'cardio dance' portion, dance steps are taught frustratingly fast (and this is from somebody that enjoys dancing!).  It took so long to figure out the steps--which are not your 'typical' exercise or step class steps--that I shut the DVD off and jumped on the treadmill.   ---  --- The two 15 minute hip and thigh workouts are a little better, but you really need to do them both back-to-back to feel any benefits. I would say this is a good video for anybody thats got LOTS of patience to learn the moves and an alternate workout for the first few times you run the DVD, because you'll get no benefit from the workout while trying to figure out what she's doing.  Save your money! 
It is really expensive for what it is.  I have to say my children love it, esspecially since we can put it in the middle of the table and everyone can take what they need from it.  I love that when we are done you can put everything back and stick it on a shelf.  However, for the supplies you get it IS expensive.  The tote itself is nice but not worth more than $5, add the supplies to it, maybe I could see spending $10.  However, if you catch it on sale I would pick up a few, they make great gifts
The table arrived within a few days and well packed. --- It was easy to put together, took me about 10 minutes.  One of the best instructions and labeling of parts I have ever seen, even a little bottle with paint for touch ups. --- The table is just like described and is of good quality.  It has a bronze/brown finish and looks great with the Strathwood deep-seating chairs I ordered earlier. Definetly would buy this again
i like this car seat. it is very soft for a bab
When Curious came out, I smelled it and had to buy it. I acknowledged at the time that the bottle was probably half of the reason I bought it (unfortunately). The bottle is beautiful and attracts many customers by itself. The fragrance is very pretty and sweet. It goes on very strong but fades quickly, which it annoying.  --- Also, maybe six months after I bought it, I noticed that it started smelling a little different. I left it in my bathroom for a while without moving it because of the difference. Today, I picked the bottle up and the sprayer was covered in this ....disgusting filmy substance, which had also dripped down the sides of the bottle and created a ring of filth on my countertop. It was really really gross. By the looks of it, the perfume had some sort of chemical reaction with the metal from the nozzle of the sprayer.  --- Anyways, the whole bottle smells awful now and it's digusting. The bottle design was it's awful putrid demise, which ruined $50. It's really unfortunate too, because I loved the bottle and the fragrance when I got it and now it's junk
This was to go to my son who chose it in his wish list. Instead it is coming to me and I can get no response. PLEASE SEND THIS TO MY SON AND NOT TO M
The title of this product is a joke.  It should be called "Not Easy CD burning".  Roxio version 5 was much easier than this one is.  It is way too complicated for burning simple CDs
I just got my pink razr phone and I love it so far. i love that it is pink and it is diffrent from the other pink phones. Even though it does not have an antenna on the outside that you can see it ,still it works well. I was scared to buy this phone because I read some of the reviews and some of them weren't saying good things about the phone but I think that they were wrong about it. Great job motorola keep up the good work
My husband was leaving more than 20 pairs of reading glasses everywhere and any where and could still never find a pair when he needed them....even to ead a menu! These glasses are the answer to anyone who wears reading glasses. I bought them in all colors for him and even bought a pair work a friend who works with him(he loves them as well and bought in more colors also). Neither of them have lost a pair in all of these months. They also have started so many conversations. Everyone who has asked about them has done the same and have bought in all colors. It takes a little adjusting and getting use to but everyone we know has never returned a pair. Only reason they have returned was to order in more colors or to order for friends and loved ones! These glasses are fantastic! Thanks for the great service
Use this gate for our 9 month old son we have an extra wide opening. One minor drawback is the screws seem to get a little loose and have to be tightened every once in awhile. All and all it is a very good product
Yeah, Johnny must've been drinking heavily during this recording. It's evident in his slurred lyrics...It's Raining is the song where he sounds totally wasted, although you can get the sense that he is infact quite happy and very relaxed. BUT  all this inebriation actually adds to the authenticity of this c.d.---- Johnny Winter really becomes the archetypal BLUESMAN on this c.d.  His guitar work is quite sparse, no long solos on this one but, nevertheless, the feel on this album is wonderful.   I have to say this also..Johnny must've been VERY, VERY brave to release this album back in 1977. That was a very bad year for the blues, appalling infact...disco music was king. Alot of bluesmen, like Johnny Guitar Watson etc were opting for the commercialism of the disco dance floor. Johnny might've thought of releasing a commercial type rock album , like Edgar was doing. Instead he chose to stay faithful to the blues and I have to admire the determination and resolve of Johnny Winter. Very few would've stayed faithful to the blues. ---  The last track with Muddy Waters ..Walking Thru The Park...captures Johnny in his element. He was SO happy back then and it filters over into the song itself. I remember seeing them both do this song live at the Capitol Radio Festival, Alexander Palace, London/England in July 1977. Never again to be repeated, sadly
The Brood is the lightning in the bottle that director David Cronenberg has never been able to duplicate. While all of his films definitely have his fingerprints all over them, The Brood managed to rise to the top of all of his films. It is absolutely dripping in a sense of dispair and dread. There is a pervading coldness about it - such that you want to wrap up in something warm as you watch it - you want to watch it with the lights on because you're very much afraid of what might be there if you turn off the lights. ---  --- The film is a psychological thriller wrapped in a slasher flick. It warrants slasher status simply because of the sheer number of onscreen murders that take place. This is a very bloody film! ---  --- Samantha Eggar is nuts and in a weird clinic for people like her. She is being treated by a creepy Oliver Reed (in one of his better performances). Art Hindle is her ex husband and he's worried about how she is treating their young daughter. After a while that is the least of his worries, as these horribly disfigured and (what the Hell are they?) bizarre little children run around killing all the people that have really ticked off Samantha Eggar. ---  --- I won't say more, because part of the horror in a Cronenberg film is the pseudo-science that he get you to believe in. ---  --- Whereas Cronenberg's Videodrome was weird, but not terribly good, The Brood is one of the creepiest films I've ever seen and a guilty pleasure (can I really call it that?) that I choose to subject myself to every so often. ---  --- Really! What ARE those things?
Microsoft is simply sloppy with their programming! ---  --- "Open Office" is a better program, is open-source (meaning if you don't want some paperclip's help, you simply don't download that part of it) AND OPEN OFFICE is FREE! It is also compatible with most of the functions that MS Office uses (and is upgraded with new features faster than MS's product, which is a rip-off!) ---  --- MS's Office 97 was the best of the Office suites, even though it did have it's problems, Spending the money to supposedly "upgrade" to this (or any other Microsoft product for that matter) is simply burning your money!)  ---  --- OPen-source software is FREE, it's perfectly legal, it is open t anyone decompiling it, so if you want to make your own custom goodies, you can, but then there are so many written by so many people willing to share, you don't have to develop your own, as there are already *SO* many freebie ones (and some low-cost additions by some places, but most are free) that if you want whistles and bells, or even a Christmas theme in February, you can get it for OPEN OFFICE! (Not so with this or ANY Microsoft product for that matter) ---  --- Simply sloppy programming - nothing more, AND you can get a fully functioning and compatable office suite for free legally
i wish it smelled more of cinnamon and less of clove. but that's just me. i'm not a huge clove fan. BUT it worked great, made my hair & scalp feel awesome. will definitely buy this again. and i can't wait to try other LUSH products
I really am pleased with my solar lights, they are the right color & everything & they seem to stay light longer
Sephora Roll-up blotting paper is so handy. Whenever you have to freshen up, this is great to use before you powder your face. All you do is rip off the right about of paper you want and blot your face. They feel weightless and matte skin. Just imagine all the oil that gets trapped into a powder puff. gosh. disgusting! Best of all, you get so much paper, the roll is never-ending! It's so tiny and compact, you would even want to share them with your friends
This was for my friend in jail.I believe he said that he's enjoying i
This Paris Hilton perfume is wonderful. I got it 2 months ago in September as one of my birthday presents from my mum. I'd heard of the Paris Hilton perfume a while back but I thought it wouldn't be that good however a few days before my birthday my mum brought home a tester and I was really shocked. The perfume smells delicous, every time I have it on I get tons of compliments. It really is a gorgeous scent perfect for night and day. I have had a lot of perfumes in my life, some of them really expensive but this is by far the best ever. I would recommend this to anyone
Not much to say here.  It works.  Easily adjustable with just your feet.  Feels good wearing socks
I bought this memory card for my camera sd500.  At first, I was very dispointed when I only see 1gb on my laptop.  After googled around, I realized I need to update my laptop sd reader driver to recognized sd card that is over 1gb.  I'm able to see full 2gb after driver update.  Just make sure you update your device/laptop firmware/driver first
This is an HBO remake of the original 50's 50 footer. Naturally there had to be some adjustments for the new era. However it still captures the thrills and chills. You may also marvel at the spandex clothing that stretches for ever (rats.) ---  --- Nancy (the little woman) does not have quite the devoted husband. Here life is not quite ideal. Soon a chance encounter with aliens (the space type) leaves her feeling bigger about the situation. 50 foot bigger. Now it is Nancy's turn for a little revenge. The ending is a little unnerving. ---  --- Be sure to see Daryl in just as serious of a role in "High spirits" (1998) --- 
tamagothchis are so much fun they are really col and there a little hard to care for  and its fun watching them change they are a great item and worth there valu
This product was nothing short of miraculous for me. --- I'm in my early forties now with skin that has been trouble-prone since I hit my teens...and while I have used various and sundry products to control breakouts from acne and rosacea (which started about age 40), including retin A cream,  topical and systemic antibiotics, and every sort of over the counter cleanser, these treatments helps but if anything my breakouts were coming closer together and getting more severe as I aged. ---  --- I've been using the mask for about 8 mos and my skin is the nicest and most healthy it's been in many years....I had rapid improvement of both my regular acne and the rosacea on top of it. ---  --- Caution - I've never had any benzoyle peroxide sensitivity. People who are irritated by benzoyle peroxide probably won't have the same kind of experience I do.   ---  --- BP creams have always helped, but were not as effective as this mask, which really gets down in the pores. ---  --- I use it heavily.  I apply it either before I brush my teeth or before I get in the shower.  It is cool and refreshing.  I usually let it sit as a mask for a few minutes before I rinse off, although sometimes I use it just as a cleanser when my skin needs freshening...like after I've walked through a cloud of someones cigarette smoke. ---  --- It leaves my skin very, very  clean,  and *soft.*  I have never had any dryness or irritation from this product at all...indeed, my skin has become less sensitive and reactive and is calm and feels good when it used to be angry and irritated all the time.  The dryness others warn of has never been an issue for me.  it makes my skin feel like normal healthy skin. ---  --- Working outside in the heat or cleaning in a dusty, dirty environment used to cause my skin to break out.  Now before cleaning or working I will actually put a bit of this mask on- wne I am done,  my skin is none the worse the wear for the activity... I stay clear and smooth.  I guess it blocks the irritants or stops the sebaceous glands from making my pores either block or become a haven for bacteria. ---  --- I do not have serious acne all over my body...just a very trouble prone face for most of my adult life.   The benzoyle peroxide mask has ended this trouble for me.  I simply smooth a couple times a day for about the time it takes to brush teeth, and wash it off.  No prescriptions, no panicked spot treatment of painful blemishes or pustules...just perfect skin for me.  Amazing!!!
My husband, the Star Wars fanatic, loves them!  Very comfy
This is one of my favorite releases from Common. This chi town warrior crafted an underground release that will bring a vibrant smile to the hardcore hip hop head and even awaken the minds of some of the fake commercial rap artist lovers. Songs like I used to love h.e.r and ressurection start the classic album and take you on the road to classic chicago hip hop. Not only the lyrics are dope but also the beats and the hooks. This is a pivotal album that needs to be in everyone's collectio
over the course of one day while at my work desk. As other reviewers noted, they are light, buttery and delicious! I'm using the second box for homemade (sorta') ice crem sandwiches. They are so tasty they really are fine plain. Now I wished I had ordered several cases when they were on sale for $12, but maybe then I'd eat too many
I've had this thing for two weeks.  Coming from the Blackberry 8700c, this phone is a big disappointment.  Work issued this and took away the Blackberry and I'm stuck with it.  All I can do is whine on the Internet, so here it goes.  ---  --- The more I use the thing the less I like it.  Here's my list, good and bad. ---  --- * Battery life - attrocious.  Use the extended battery, throw away the standard one.  Trust me.  Grade: D. ---  --- * Navigation - cumbersome.  The keys are too small, the 5-way nav with buttons get pressed accidentally.  Workable if you don't have huge hands.  Grade: B ---  --- * Windows Mobile - I hate it.  Why do applications not quit when you end them?  Instead they stay memory resident and you have to manually cancel them using the task manager.  The menu is pre-loaded with goodies to buy from Cingular, how convenient.  Grade: C+ if you bother to learn the shortcut keys. ---  --- * Java is broken, Google email doesn't work.  Maps DOES work with the new version, thankfully.  Grade: C. ---  --- * No standard headphone jack.  HELLO??  This is suppose to be an MP3 player, right?  Somebody explain to me why this is OK.  Grade: F. ---  --- * Phone quality - Grade A.  Yes, they did something right.  The phone works great, reception is great, speakerphone is great.  Bluetooth is great.  ---  --- * Outlook & email - This is workable, but difficult.  You can write an email, you can edit your schedule and tasks, but it's not easy.  If Blackberry gets and "A" (and it does), Blackjack gets a C.  It doesn't synch notes, so if you're an Outlook Notes person you're just left out, sorry.  Why?? ---  --- * Hardware quality - Very good, B+.  The thing really feels solidly built.  The screen is vibrant and attractive.  The camera seems to work fine, although I may use it twice per year. ---  --- In short, if you really want to get work done on your phone get a Blackberry.  If you want a phone that does a lot of things poorly but looks nice, this could be the one for you.
Wonderful cd the music brings back a lot of childhood memories! A must have for those who are looking for a cd that includes Neil Diamond's top hits.
I ordered these pajamas for a xmas gift for someone that loves Happy Bunny.  The pj's were cheaply made and the pants were very short...it didn't say anywhere in the description that that were capri length.  They were definitely not worth the price
'The Curse of the Grebes' is sort of a tribute to the Red Sox return to World Series glory with cameos by Damon, Timlin and Renteria. Timlin actually does a great acting job and even recites a poem by Emily Dickinson with remarkable aplomb. 'Arthur Changes Gears' is also great, he gets a bike he's been coveting for a while but when he finally gets it he's so worried about getting it dirty that he won't ride it
This is a great idea, however if your crib has anything larger than a Jenny Lind style piece of wood on it, it won't work.  We don't have a sleigh style crib, but the top edges were still too large for the velcro to even touch.  It would be great if they would come up with a larger size to work for the more popular/larger style cribs everyone seems to be making/buying these days
Please read Naomi Jakobs' review for Relevant Magazine below. It captures so brilliantly and eloquently the heart of the Christian 'post-modern' kick. If you have to go out of your way to claim you're a celebrity, then you simply aren't a celebrity (Take "Fitness Celebrity" John Basedow for example). In the same way, if you have go out of your way to claim that the Post-modern Evangelical movement is relevant, then you're claim for relevancy is simply not credible. The Christian church has certainly played a vastly significant role in the past 2000 years. However pop-culturalizing Evangelical Christianity isn't causing it to be any more relevant than it was when Sandi Patty or Carmen ruled the Christian top 40. Does the fact that some Christians enjoy the latest musical fads make the concept of accepting a human blood-sacrifice for the pardon of sins more palatable
Bueno esta Quemadora Dvd muy buena recomendable, para los usuarios que quieran vivir una experiencia unica, es la mejor que ha existido, gracias amazon por vender productos de vanguardi
I have had this smoker since August and have a total of 20 hours smoking on it. I noticed that the thermosat was starting to burn out after 4 hours of use and by hour 20 it was gone rendering the smoker useless.  ---  --- The other problem I have is that the porcelain coating inside the cooking chamber has all pealed off leaving bare metal exposed. ---  --- Dealing with Charbroil to get it repaired or replaced is useless. ---  --- At the start it was a nice easy to use smoker but with the problems encountered I would pass for something better
I use this gem on my 20D along with my 24-105mm, and as far as I'm concerned it is one of the best optical lenses out there. My 24-105 isn't the ideal indoor/low light lens nor is it the ideal sports photography lens( although it is sharp, just not quite long enough) The 70-200 fills in that gap in my arsenal with IS to boot! The photos I've taken so far on the sidelines are all keepers. If you can afford it, do it, you won't regret i
We have been buying the Melita Buzzworthy Dark Roast pods for over two years and were quite satisfied.  Recently, they increased the diameter of the pods to enable them to fit other machines.  I also understand thet they have increased the diameter of the pod holder in the new machines they are selling.  At the time Melita made these changes, I believe they also reduced the quality of the coffee in their new pods because it just does not taste nearly as good.  Accordingly, I rated the old pods with 4 stars but the new pods deserve only 2 stars.  We are now sampling pods from other companies to find a good dark roast coffee
I discovered a bug in the program which seriously affects its integrity. --- Have been on the phone with Quicken techs numerous times and they finally acknowledged that there is a problem with the program and a patch (fix) needs to be developed.  So far though, they have not done it
I absolutely love this deck.  I bought this along with "Zombie Madness" and the "Warrior's Triumph" structure decks.  They all rock,  but this is my favorite.  And for the guy who gave the Winged Dragon Of Ra tip, on the bottom of the card it says "THIS CARD CANNOT BE USED IN A DUEL". So even if you happen to get one [which costs a LOT] you can't officially use it. Overall,  this deck is very cool.  I love Red Eyes Darkness dragon!  ---  ---  --- P.S. For best results,  buy the Yu-Gi-Oh! deluxe pack for 20$.  It comes with "Dragon's Roar" and "Zombie Madness" plus two rare cards ["Rope Of Life" and "Armed Dragon LV7"]. Here's what they do: ---  ---  --- Rope Of Life ---  --- PGD-105-Ultra Rare --- Trap Card: --- This card can only be activated by discarding your entire hand when 1 of your own monsters is sent to the Graveyard as a result of battle. Special Summon the monster just sent to the Graveyard in face-up Attack or Defense Position, and increase its ATK by 800 points. ---  --- "Armed Dragon LV7" ---  ---  This card cannot be Normal Summoned or Set. This card cannot be Special Summoned except by the effect of "Armed Dragon LV5". Send 1 monster card from your hand to the Graveyard to destroy all face-up monsters on your opponent's side of the field with an ATK equal to or less than the ATK of the sent monster. ---  ---  ---  --- Add this the deck for an amazing combo!  Start off by setting a Masked Dragon card in defense mode.  When your opponent destroys it,  use its effect to summon "Armed Dragon LV3".  During your Standby Phase,  Send it to the graveyard to Special Summon "Armed Dragon LV5".  Then use it to attack your opponent's monster which is most likely destroyed.  Then when you end your turn use its effect to special summon "Armed Dragon LV7" from your hand OR deck!  You now have a 2800 atk points on the field!  Sweet!  And its effect is soooooooooo cool. I put the "Rope Of Life" card in my "Warrior's Triumph" structure deck.  It helps out a lot! I hope you will make the right choice in buting this deck or the more preferable deluxe pack.  Yu-Gi-Oh! Your Move
Well, this lens does work wonderfully to expand your angle for better shots, but if you don't have good lighting, you end up with pictures that are worthless.  I suggest never using this in poor indoor lighting as the flash that comes on the DX6490 does not clear the top of the wide angle lens and therefore becomes useless.  Best for outdoor shots or areas where overhead and backlighting are sufficient enough to take pictures without the use of a flash.  Plan ahead before just attatching the lens and taking pictures.  Also remember that because you can't use the flash option, you will need to stabilize the camera better to avoid blurry shots.  Otherwise, this lens is excellent.  It fits easily into my camera bag, is simple to attach (with the lens converter of course) and takes great shots without the fisheye effect.  Other than the inability to use my flash with the lens, I think it is great
When it comes to ink for my R1800 photo printer, I am concerned with the quality of the images I print. The Epson matte black UltraChrome Hi-Gloss ink cartridge provides superior resistance to water, fading and smudging. It is important to me that my prints are of high quality, so I don't attempt to use the cheaper compatible ink cartridges. The color can be duplicated, but all inks are not created equal.  Third party options may produce a good print initially, but may not hold up or last as long. ---  --- PROS: --- Provides superior resistance to water, fading and smudging ---  --- CONS: --- Pric
These were a gift at Christmas, and were a deep burgundy color. they do appear to be well stitched. however, after no more than 2 hand washings in cold water the color showed alot of fading, and by the 3rd wash I knew they would have to be returned as the color fading was uneven and the tops adn bottoms almost don't look like a match anymore.  the silk is soft and lovely but the color should NOT fade this fast or this much!
so i bought this item and i hated it. I wash my hair everyday and it completly dryed out my hair! it does smell good though but other than that ive used it about 4 times and thats all it took to realize this is just not for me
I would like to buy one of these products from Wine Country Gift Baskets but I cannot find a description of what is actually in each one
My wife dropped the original remote and it quite working.  It turns out there are PCB's inside and one surface mount connector to the other board came loose so I resoldered it and it worked for a little while, probably until the next time she dropped it. ---  --- I bought the updated remote and one drop was all it took to disable the receive part of it also.  Could not find the problem this time.  It still transmitted, but eventually quit transmitting after the alarm was on.  I unlocked the truck manually and every time someone opened or closed a door the alarm would go off and I could not start the truck.  I messed with it (while in the parking lot of an amusment park) for a long time and evetually got it to stop, probably by entering valet mode, I'm not sure. ---  --- Don't waste your money on another $100 remote.  I am shopping for a remote that is transmit only without the LCD.  Should be more reliable.  My suggestion is to buy a system that comes with 2 remotes: One LCD and one simple.  Better yet, buy a system that does not have the feedback, or 2 way, and save a lot of money and headache.  You won't use it anyway
The spring on these tongs broke on first use, in September, 2006.  This renders them largely useless. I purchased the tongs after reading manufacturer assurances dated many months ago that the spring problem had been repaired.  Despite this assurance, I am here to tell you that a pair shipped recently is still defective.  I returned them, and I cannot recommend these tongs
Yes, the cable fits, but the CD driver is just for the 8300. I was not able to get it working
i RECENTLY BOUGHT THIS CASIO AUTOMIC SOLAR POWERED WATCH AND WAS VERY EXCITED BY THE AUTOMATIC TIME KEEPING FETURE.  iT IS AGREAT WATCH BUT DOES NOT HAVE A TIMER BUILT IN WHICH I NEED WHEN WORKING OUT FARTLEK RUNS AND IN BETWEEN SETS.  iT HAS A USELESSS FETURE OF RECORDING TIME OF EVENTS WHICH I AM NOT SURE WHY ANYONE WOULD ACTUALLY NEED THIS WITH OUT THE DATA OF WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPPENED DURING THOSE 30 RECORDED EVENTS?  wISH CASIO WOULD PUT A TIMER IN IT GUESS I'LL GO BACK TO A TIMEX IRONMAN LATER
The slick stylish Spanish thriller "Nobody Knows Anybody" is set in Seville during Holy Week in the year 2000. Newspaper crossword puzzle developer and would-be writer Simon Cardenas (Eduardo Noriega) is struggling as usual with his novel when he receives a cryptic telephone message ordering him to use the word "adversary" as an answer to an upcoming crossword clue. Since the message also contained threats, Simon does what he's told, and he soon finds himself embroiled in a nightmarish sequence of events.  ---  --- Directed by Mateo Gil, "Nobody Knows Anything" opens with a scene of a man stabbed to death with a crucifix through his heart, and this scene is one of the ideas that feeds the notion you are about to see some sort of horror film with religious overtones, but the plot moves away from the horror aspect into straight thriller territory. The film--which owes much of its style to American thrillers--is slickly produced, and the exotic settings of the sights and sounds of Seville help, but the preposterous plot with its huge gaps in logic and implausibility ultimately left this viewer disappointed and feeling a bit cheated by the experience.  ---  --- I was intrigued at first by the film and drawn into the plot. However, once the plot and the mystery aspect became clear (and I can't give away too much here), the film became silly and trite. There's little character development--our hero is a flat, dull passive character, and the film's emphasis is on the thrill aspect. A slick product that is ultimately empty and really ridiculous, this film is in Spanish with English subtitles--displacedhuma
This is a very nice mitt, although not as good as another one I have which is a bit heavier.  Still a good buy, though
This album is way overated, let me tell you why. ---  --- Wack MC: --- MF Doom is a bad rapper, not the worst, just bad. He can flow but his rymes are weak, corny, and somtimes it doesnt make sense at all. The corniest ryme I heard was- "We rock the house like rock 'n roll/ got more soul Than a sock with a hole." LMAO! It gets worse "Take it from the Tec-9 holder/ They bit and dont know they neck shine from shinola" What is he talking about??? He is not a genius MC, Nas is, he is even worse than Aesop Rock. Which they rap with words and dont even make any sense. ---  --- Filler: --- This Cd has too much filler, they have like 10 songs that last only 50 secs. Some of them is not even neccasary. ---  --- Average Beats: --- The beats are either average or just sucks. I can make better beats on Fruity Loops. However Track 22 "Rhinestone Cowboy" had the best beat on the entire album. The beat was hot to tell you the truth, but that only gives it one star. ---  --- Overall this album sucks, just download "Rhinestone Cowboy" and call it a day. I think Madlib can make good beats its just that he didnt show it here. I dont recommend this album, if you want a good album get Mos Def "Black on Both Sides" It 10x better than this
If a "suspense" filmed was played in the woods, and it didn't actually contain any suspense, would a bear watch it?  ---  --- The previous sentence makes about as much suspense as the reason behind making "Domestic Disturbance", the newest `thriller' starring John Travolta, Vince Vaughn and Teri Polo.  ---  --- Let's talk for a few minutes about Mr. Travolta. Can anyone name an actor who has received more chances in his career and squandered them? I think that Travolta has now surpassed Richard Dreyfuss as the comeback/ lose it again king. After a brilliant comeback engineered by his longtime admirer Quentin Tarantino in "Pulp Fiction", Travolta appeared in a number of films that were interesting and proved interesting choices. "Face/Off" and "Broken Arrow" highlighted a string of hits that ultimately allowed Travolta to join the $20 million club. In the last few years, every film Travolta has appeared in has failed miserably. "Lucky Numbers"? "The General's Daughter"? That film was a hit but can anyone even remember one significant scene from it? "Swordfish"? Interesting, but a flop. "Battlefield Earth"? Why does he keep making this trash? It has to be the paychecks. I can't see any other conceivable reason. John, baby, how long before the studios realize that these films aren't making any money and they stop hiring you? John, baby, how long before you need another comeback vehicle?  ---  --- Frank Morrison (John Travolta) is a divorced father who makes wooden boats. He doesn't get a lot of business, but the business that he does get gets a great deal. He doesn't charge his customers enough to make a profit. Frank does this because HE IS THE GOOD GUY. His son, Danny (Matthew O'Leary) has a lot of problems accepting his mom's (Teri Polo) new relationship with Rick Barnes (Vince Vaughn). He gets into a lot of trouble and lies to everyone. A couple of days after his mom and Rick get married, he stows away in Rick's car and witnesses him murdering a business associate. The police don't believe him however. After a little soul searching, Frank believes his son. He may lie to everyone, but he doesn't lie to Frank.  ---  --- Directed by Harold Becker ("Sea of Love"), "Domestic Disturbance" is a suspense film without any suspense. From the moment Danny stows away in Rick's car and WATCHES HIM MURDER Ray (Steve Buscemi), which we also watch, we know who the good guy is and who the bad guy is. To make matters worse, Frank instantly believes his son, which means that the film boils down to a cat and mouse game between Frank and Rick. A boring cat and mouse game. When you know the identity of the villain, a huge percentage of the suspense is flushed down the toilet. When Frank believes Danny early on, the rest of the suspense is flushed down with it.  ---  --- The film would've been greatly improved by showing Danny in the backseat of the car, watching everything, the pain and suspense registering on his face, while the audience sees nothing. Then, when Danny tries to convince his dad, the police chief, his mom, that Rick is a murderer, at least we haven't seen the act, and we would require some convincing as well.  ---  --- Because the filmmakers chose to show us everything, the next logical step to provide some suspense would be to have Frank doubt Danny, his son. However, after a very brief segment, Frank believes Danny, causing us to watch a battle between Frank and Rick, which isn't very interesting.  ---  --- Each of the actors, including Travolta, are serviceable in their roles, but because the film robs us of just about everything in the first fifteen minutes, the remaining ninety become an exercise in tedium.  ---  --- Skip "Domestic Disturbance". It isn't even worthy of a video rental. Go to see the far superior and very different "Amelie" or "The Man Who Wasn't There". Your money will be much better spent.
I just input all the information for my return and this software has me owing over $8000.  By my calculations I'm owed a refund of $150-200.  It is not taking federal income tax already paid from annuities into account.  Back to the calculator for me
This toy is the most stupidest thing i have ever had. The only reason why i gave it a one is because you couldn't give it a zero. First of all this thing beeps every five seconds. I swear even when im sleeping this thing beeps. It wsn't always like that when i got it i would bring it to school then everyone started getting one even kindergarners had one then the princble banned them because one third grader lost hers. During class kids would ask me do you want to connect? Im just saying this is a toy for little ones. This toy can also get repetative i mean its a baby then it gets a tooth ache toddler teen adult old person. So parents if your thining about buying this toy for your children dont because in about a month and a half they would probably stop using it. So dont buy it
I have to say that this book is fantastic- step by step photographs for each garnish.  I just made a crab out of a cucumber in 5 minutes! 
THE STORY OF NASA'S SUCESSFULL FAILURE! ! ! ---  --- This movie is base on Jim Lovell's book LOST MOON, the title coming from the fact that EVERY other astronuat that went to the moon the first time would walk on it the second. Lovell is the ONLY man to circe it both times he went there!  ---  --- What makes this film so realistic is that Dave Scott (7th man out of 12 to walk on the moon)was technicial advisor on the film. I've known the story of the flight very well for years before the film was released, and watching the film I'd say to myself that this is about the time that XXX happened and sure enough a few minutes later it sure did! ---  --- Look quick at the very end of the movie for the REAL Jim Lovell, he's the Navy Captian with gray hair shaking T. Hanks hand! ---  --- see the IMAX version last. Several scenes have been edited out
This album contains only rap and no rock songs.  This was very disappointing to say the least
 --- Hello, ---  --- (I trully hope you don't lose your money, because it trully hurts to buy something so expensive with high hopes). ---  --- =( trust me, this doesn't work, i sadly bought both of them Body Bare and LAdyfair. I spent over $300.00 including s/h and boy was i dissapointed. ---  --- I would like to say, that if you would like to purchase a personal trimmer or private area shaver you should think about it, i would like to tell you so that no one else is fooled by the looks or sites. I also bought everything with it! i got the entire combo and more. Since i wanted to be completely shaven without having to go through brazilian waxing pain i researched for over 2 weeks!!!! ---  --- 2 weeks! none stop to make sure i bought the right product. Body bare or Ladyfair are the same. These trimmers don't do anything, sadly a normal shaver is better than this. Plus it leaves BUMPS AND RASHES!!!!
To put it succinctly, Brendan Fraser is a college senior who ends up writing a ridiculously long thesis, which is then swiped by Joe Pesci, the homeless dude who, predictably, is really quite wise.  The problem is that his "wise" sayings aren't really too wise; he's like the guy you know who is always trying to sound intelligent, but doesn't really know that much. Joe Pesci's character is pretty annoying.  That's probably why he ended up friends with Brendan Fraser's character
This belt is seriously great.  I ordered it and it arrived 3 days later, exactly as the seller described.  I'm not sure what the previous review was all about, but my belt is great.  I love how I can use interchangeable buckles with it
Understand. I have a full MS New Office Suite that I got from work.   But choose to use this product for the many items included which can't be beat. If you just want to use Word and nothing else then get it alone. This is fine. But the other products are worth the discount and rebate also. Cost is the lowest I found. If you have a reward ceriticate using Amazon Credit card. That $25 more off the price. So in the end it cost me $30 for it. Shop smart and use any break you could get. Right?
The doll looks nothing like the Aidan in the movie.  Actually, his face is kind of funny looking.  The movie Aidan is cuter.  The doll could definitely have been made better
These pods are excellent! Same taste as your favorite coffee shop at a fraction of the price
I am big horror movie fan so this flick sat with me fairly well.It was kind of cornie but with Yvonne(lily munster)DeCarlo and a great actor in Rod Steiger it held my interest,also throw in Michael J Pollard who always plays an off the wall character and I guess that is what keeps this movie afloat
Watching this movie is about as much fun as having your wisdom teeth pulled. Boring and tacky even by horror standards, the only fun comes from seeing the psychic kids' future wicked stepfather being eaten by the monster that lives in his closet, hence the title. I've seen far worse, but those worse movies were more "enjoyable" than this. The following morning you probably won't remember having seen it. If only the monster had eaten this movie's negative, then we would all be spared
Tool is very easy to use. Just plug it into your OBDII connector, turn the key and watch it record the fault codes. Then plug it into the USB port of your computer and your done. Software is intuitive and defines all codes captured by the unit and then allows you to create a printout. One use and it's paid for when compared to the hassle and expense of taking the car to the shop. Also prevents fraud since you can tell the shop what is wrong.
At Christmas 2003 I was very excited with the $50 scale my family purchased for me. It worked as advertised for about six months. Then it displayed the ERR message more and more. We replaced the battery. Then it would not permit any function buttons to perform. We just sighed and used my expensive gift as any $7 bathroom scale. When it went completely blank this week, battery of no use, I hopped on the internet to see what anyone else's experience is. To be fair, I will contact the manufacturer and see if they can make it right. I hope they can. If not, I will see what the Weight Watchers scales is like. Sigh ...
I agree with several others about it being VERY difficult to clean. There are so many nooks and crannies. I used it for my daughter and hated it and then tried it again when I had my son and it was no different. My son is 16 months old and has been learning to feed himself and there are times that I do not want to let him practice because I dread how long it takes me to clean after each meal. I went out and bought an inexpensive highchair without all of the bells and whistles and it works great! Now I have more time to spend playing with him instead of cleaning a highchair.
I was so happy to pick up Meridian. It's a great mix of fiction and poetry and I couldn't put it down until I finished it
I'm sorry, but these just weren't for me, they have somewhat of a stale taste. I recommend buying a single bag before buying a case if you are at all hesitant
I am a mild audophile, and I love these headphones. They have great base response, treble, and isolation. If you listen to music on the bus on train while listening for your stop, don't get get these! You won't be able to hear a thing outside of the music
I've purchased other bags but this one beats all & it was a great Price to
This is a sturdy and attractive solution to my patio umbrella problem.
I am tired of companies making money off of fakes.  The U.S. Government did not buy their field jackets from China.  These M65 O.D. Green Field Jackets are not real--They are a mid-grade reproductions
This Yakima roof rack system works great and I highly recommend it. I bought one for my Mazda 3 and have used it, along with a Yakima roof rack for 2 cross country ski trips (I live a Florida, skiing is far away). The rack hasn't shifted an inch and was relatively easy to install. Yakima has a product guide on their site to make sure you order the right pieces for your model car
Flax is a plant. The seeds in the flax plant are filled with flaxseed oil, (sometimes called linseed oil). The seeds contain fatty oils called alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) and linoleic acid. ALA is the omega-3 oil in flaxseed. Flaxseed contains both omega-3 fatty acids and omega-6 fatty acids. Flaxseed is nature's richest storehouse of omega-3 fatty acids, and contains more than twice as much omega-3 oil as fish oils, and it costs less , ounce for ounce. Flax also contains other important substances like lignans, which may protect against some types of cancer. The husks of the seeds are rich in mucilage. Both the seed oil and mucilage have many nutritional and therapeutic properties.  ---  --- There are many potential benefits from taking Flax seed oil: ---  --- Flaxseed Oil lowers cholesterol levels, thereby improving cardiovascular health and lessening the risk of arteriosclerosis.  ---  --- Flaxseed also contains plant nutrients like phytoestrogens. These are natural estrogen-like substances that can lessen the discomfort of menopause. ---  --- Flaxseed oil may lower high blood pressure. ---  --- Flaxseed oil helps some people improve their psoriasis and eczema, as it has anti-inflammatory properties. Flaxseed may also reduce the itching, swelling, and redness associated with certain skin disorders such as acne. ---  --- Flaxseed oil has a positive effect on rheumatoid arthritis due to its ability to calm inflammation.  ---  --- Flaxseed reduces LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol (the body's "bad cholesterol") and lowers triglyceride levels. Research shows that flaxseed oil gives much better protection against heart attacks than canola oil or olive oil.  ---  --- Taking flaxseed may reduce cancer risk. This is because flaxseed contains the richest sources of lignan building blocks, which play a major role in preventing cardiovascular diseases and cancer. New research indicates that the lignans in flaxseed have both short-term and long-term protective effects against colon cancer.  ---  --- Nature Made Flaxseed Oil is a quality source of flaxseed oil, as the company is well-known and reputable. One tip: keep your flaxseed oil away from light and heat, as both degrade the oil.  ---  --- The usual beneficial dose of Flaxseed Oil is 2-3 capsules once per day taken with a meal.   ---  --- The benefits of Flaxseed Oil are cumulative.  Commit to taking it every day without fail.  Like any herbal supplement, don't expect dramatic quick results.  The results you get will be subtle at first and then build over time.  For specific conditions such as Rhematoid arthritis, exzema, psoriasis, acne, etc,. the results should be apparent in 4-8 weeks.  Be patient!  Know that even if you don't "feel" different, you are sill protecting your body from the harmfull effects of many disease conditions.   ---  --- Jim "Konedog" Koeni
I agree with everyone that wants old nick. I remember putting on the TV and watching Legends Of The Hidden Temple,Guts,Are You Afraid Of The Dark? and so on. Put them on dvd. People would SURELY buy it
My 22-month-old has loved this toy for almost a year.  The shapes are attractively colored and very pleasing to hold, and the attached hammer never gets lost!  All in all, a very nice version of a timeless toy
      Was shipped very promptly. ---      Not the largest man's umbrella but well designed. --- Looks like someone really studied how umbrellas can wreck themselves by blowing inside out. So that this one won't
This lens hood designed specificaly for the Coolpix 5700 is a must-have accessory.  It does more than just protecting the lens, which it certainly does, esp. for those busy moments when you might bump the front of the camera on something solid.  (Don't forget Murphy's Law.) ---  --- But the lens hood can also improve your picture quality.  As with SLR lenses, the hood prevents light from entering the camera lens from the sides and enhances the sharpness and contrast of the picture.  This is especially true outdoors when the light is diffused (scattered).  Just use this all the time (see exception below) and your pictures out of the 5700 will be at their best (all other factors being equal, of course). ---  --- The only times you should *NOT* use the hood is when you use the built-in flash on the 5700, esp. indoors when the flash is used as the main lighting source.  The hood will block the flash and cast an ugly shadow on your nearby subject.  Even outdoors when you use the built-in flash for fill-in light, you should remove the hood first to avoid uneven exposure. ---  --- Get the hood today to improve your pictures and protect your camera
I first tried this product when I was studying in Philadelphia. I ordered it for an Organic group I lead on campus and the reviews were outstanding. I simply love the product and taste of the hemp seeds. No trace drugs, just natural nutritionally-beneficial components
 Our "Storage Shed" is perfect!...We are very pleased with the quality & size of this unit!...Our shed was delivered via: "EAGLE USA", and I must say, this company is awesome, A++...We had never dealt with this company before...They called me ahead to set up a "delivery time."...The truck arrived EXACTLY ON-TIME,(earlier actually) & the driver was EXTREMELY polite, very helpful, very neat & tidy!!!...The paperwork was precise & legible!...Hopefully we will get to use "EAGLE USA" in the future!!...Thank-you!...Sincerely, Deborah Slessinger  
I bought this for my son for Christmas after he saw it advertised in a magazine.  He has been playing with it almost non-stop since then.   It is loud and somewhat intricate but easily masterable by small kids. It also connects with other Matchbox sets and comes with a mat for layout.  Based on my boy's interest and use so far, this rates 5 out of 5
This is delicious but packed with MSG which is very bad for you. Take care
The smoothest cup of coffee I have ever enjoyed. Mild yet distinctive in character with a fine finish(the aftertaste in the mouth after you swallow.)  --- On a recent visit to Costa Rica, My wife and I visited a Britt coffee plantation. On a very well prepared tour, we were shown the origen and migration of coffee cultivation. In addition we were shown what makes a great coffee, great. 100% Arabica beens grown at high altitude plantations whose soil contains volcanic ash. --- The roasts were explained in the following terms; --- Light Roast, the smooth tasting coffee with the greatest caffein content. Tastes similar to Chock Full o' Nuts coffee. --- Medium Roast, more full bodied. --- Dark Roast, Stronger taste similar to many after dinner coffees. --- French Roast, stronger yet, fullbodied as you would find at retail coffee shops .
An English Teacher's review.  To my fellow educators: ---  --- I have just finished spending the better part of an afternoon watching all three film versions of "Treasure Island."  I've seen the version with Charlton Heston, the one with Jack Palance and the 1950 Disney version. ---  --- It is my unpleasant duty to report that a proper film of "Treasure Island" has apparently not yet been made, as all three were so abysmally bad that I was unable to finish them. ---  --- What no director has yet come close to capturing, is the relentless grandeur with which the book itself unfolds, and the simple directness of Stevenson's 19th century morality tale.  Without exception, all three of these films seem to flounder in a sea of confusion about what this book should actually be; and none of them seem to have even the tiniest jot of the kind of vision displayed by classic illustrators such as Wythe. ---  --- Again and again with each film, someone seems to have made the decision that the story exactly as told by Stevenson apparently wouldn't be interesting enough or exciting enough for the big screen.  What I really want to know is if any of these directors actually READ the book, or had a personal relationship with it?  I find it hard to believe that they did, since the films all give the impression of slapdash commercialism or outright confusion about what the book actually is. ---  --- Jim Hawkins is living quietly with his parents in a seaside inn, when the Captain shows up with his sea chest and a mysterious fear of "a seafaring man with one leg."  The Captain should be tall, mysterious, powerful and terrifying.  In two of these films, he seems to be played by short wrinkled winos; and in the third by some middle-aged guy who is apparently married to the lighting director's sister.  It only gets worse from there. ---  --- The tragedy of the Captain is that he is still physically vigorous and imposing at the start of the book - but Stevenson is bringing a doom to him that will shatter even the English oak of his adamant constitution - the combined forces of rum, terror and stroke. ---  --- The Captain's fate - to fall dead of a "thundering apoplexy" on the floor of the inn, forshadows the essential purpose of Stevenson's novel - to illustrate that a life of bloodthirsty avarice and short-sighted greed leads only to an ignominious death.  In the guise of a boy's adventure story, Stevenson pursues this deeper moral with a terrible purpose and with great dignity and power.  His pirate characters are not comic or lighthearted.  They are not caricatures.  They are not the wax mannequins of a Disney ride; they are real men with fears and desires and second thoughts; even with regrets.  They do not dance or traipse merrily through this story - they grimace and battle through it, gritting their teeth against the death, (from violence, sickness, treachery or rum,) that is always staring them in their faces.  Jim Hawkins' innocence and youth is the perfect foil for the pirates' hard-bitten cynicism and gold-lust.  It is no accident that, despite the courage and resourcefulness of the cabin party, (led by Captain Smollett,) it is still only Jim Hawkins' youthful optimism and curious spirit that ultimately saves them from "death at the hands of the pirates."  Stevenson is alluding to the biblical command to "be like the little children in order to be saved." ---  --- To tell this story properly, it must be told absolutely straight, and with the same committed earnestness with which Stevenson tells it.  None of these films is that brave. ---  --- To make a film that is faithful to Stevenson's moral, the director will need more courage and simplicity of purpose than we find in all three of these films combined.  Those of us who love and understand the novel for what it is must continue to hope for a film that does it justice.
I may just need to buy another guitar.  So one can be at their house and one for here.  It is a very nice little guitar - better than I expected for the money
 This product works well and saved me lots of money. It is easy to use
As anyone who has tried Bahlsen Hit cookies knows, they are absolutely yummy, despite the odd packaging and name.  A nice crunchy cookie, not sickeningly sweet, good with cream and sugar tea.  funny thing about the minis though, both sides of the cookie are facing the same direction, so that one of the sides is the "wrong" way, with the printed side towards the cream....just a sidebar--no detraction from how tasty these cookies are.  
I couldn't believe what a hard time I had trying to find a small, hardback, unlined notebook with book-like binding! I'll admit that I bought this product because it was the only one I could find that fulfilled these requirements. But I am extremely pleased with the overall quality of this notebook. I am using it to record my favorite quotes and it is perfect for that purpose thus far. The only downfalls I can say may stem from the fact that I am writing in it with a fountain pen. The ink tends to "vein out" a bit if you will and I can't write on both sides of the paper because the ink is too dark. Otherwise I love the appearance of both the cover and the paper. I can't speak for how it handles for sketching. I also like the small pocket on the inside of the back cover. With shipping it is a bit pricey, but definitely a great product
I tried another rotisserie I got from an auction, and was sadly disappointed.   The mounting brackets did not fit, there was no counterweight, and the meat forks were cheaply made.   ---  --- THIS unit however, is great.  First, the mounting brackets are truly "universal", and should fit just about any grill.  Mine mounted perfectly on my Aussie Bonza Deluxe 3 grill without issue.  Installation only takes about 5 minutes.   The mounting brackets allow for various distances between your grill's mounting holes, and multiple sets of holes allow for various height adjustments.   If your grill has two holes on either side, you should be set. ---  --- The single-piece spit rod is heavy duty, the counter weight included is heavy enough to assist with balancing heavier roasts (or chickens), and the four-pronged meat forks are well made.  ---  --- The motor comes with a long cord (about 3 feet- most other units have much shorter cords!), and the fact that the motor has an on/off switch is a nice plus.     ---  --- Lastly, for all the praise I can give this unit, I was also pleased that it's attractively priced.  I have seen many other rotisseries that seem to be much more expensive, and not built nearly as well
I am on something like my 5th pedometer and until recently, I didn't want to invest a lot in one.  I bought this because I thought it looked cool and was a great price.  It fell off constantly!  For a few days I would pin it to my pants but that was time comsuming and annoying, not to mention painful when the pin stuck me!  It is fairly accurate, but who cares if you are always worried about it popping off and falling to the floor?  I finally invested in an Omron that not only stays on, but has a security latch you can attach to your clothing in case it does come off it will not fall to the ground.  I also bought it on Amazon, but it was around $18.99.  It stores a week's worth of steps for you so you can track your progress.  I am in love with my new pedometer, I wish I would have invested in this one first
I bought this Thermometer when my second son was born, thinking it would be easy to use and good for the money. My husband and I tested it on ourselves to see how accurate it was. We both got 5 different readings. I didn't see what the need of the plastic covers were for, since we ran out of them quickly.(Not to mention, you can't find replacements anywhere.) My biggest complant was that after a month, the product completely stopped working, even after changing the batteries. I would suggest paying the extra money to get a better thermometer
This did nothing for my lashes, which are blonde, but long, so it doesn't take all that much.  It somehow made them look skimpy and clumpy too.  I discovered Diorshow after this and it's phenominal!   But if you want a very good mascara and don't want to spend the money, I recommend Max Factor 2000 calorie. 
We had a really cheap monitor before we bought this one because it was just so noisy.. so we bought this one thinking it was going to be quieter.  Well, it is ALOT quieter than our monitor, but like others said, it makes this awful beeping noise!  It has gone off twice in the middle of the night before!  We also have another digital phone, so it is constantly switching channels as well trying to find an available channel.  I would look elsewhere for another monitor.. The beeping is what gets to me - I dont like being woke up by a very loud beep in the middle of the night! 
Surely I'm not the only one who found this book totally [bad].  The only thing it made me wonder about is how it's possible to write such a thorougly BORING book about such fascinating women.  The writing is just dull and full of the author's biases and prejudices, which just aren't nearly as interesting as the subjects themselves.  It's written in that old-school feminism (negative, no fun) tone that thank God feminism has since moved beyond.  My advice:  find another book about women mystics not filtered through Flinder's lens
This is a difficult album to review. People either embrace it or pass it off as an overproduced, overblown waste of their time. However, I can say that this is my favorite Oasis album. Why? That's a very good question...maybe because Be Here Now was my introduction to Oasis, and I could tell that this band had a lot to offer, even through the drug-addled, overproduced songs that seemed to last forever. Each one is very catchy and has an overall feel-good quality to it, two characteristics of most Oasis songs.  ---  --- It's no use comparing Be Here Now to Morning Glory or Def. Maybe, because it's in a whole other ballpark. This is Oasis going totally over the top and pushing their music to the limit. No doubt that all the coke helped with that. It's my firm belief that Morning Glory and Def. Maybe were and still are great albums in their own rights. Be Here Now is just something else, you either love it or hate it. It has it's own little Oasis category. I can see why it never really lived up to its two famous predecessors. ---  --- There are some valid complaints about this album, though. One, it is very very overproduced, filled to the top with snarling buzzing guitars and who knows what else. Unfortunately, this makes it hard to listen to with earphones for very long. Two, the songs are astonishingly long at times. All Around the World, while an excellent song, clocks in at around 9:20. I believe that the shortest song is I Hope, I Think, I Know, coming in at 4:23. So you know you're in for a long, wild ride.  ---  --- However, only Oasis could pull this off - making ridiculously long songs that are almost ear-numbing to listen to - and every minute is made enjoyable. All the arrogance, coke, and swagger in these songs is perhaps what makes it so appealing to some people. And of course, there's that small note on the upper left-hand corner of pages 7 and 8 in the booklet that proclaims : "The Beatles are quite good, but Oasis is much better." ---  --- And so a resounding yes to all of these: overproduced, arrogant, drug-induced, staggering, amazing, excellent. I don't care about the negative things, though, because that's what makes Be Here Now a sucess in its own right.  ---  ---  --- 
I am in the Army and because of that this watch has it's pluses and minuses.  I travel the world, so the multiple time zones is awsome.  The time stamp feature is great for when I need help remember when a specific event happened.  As for the solar power.  It's great in that you don't have to worry about batteries, but most watch batteries last close to five years anyway.  In the Army I find myself doing lots of night missions, and I can go months without seeing the sun because I have to catch up on sleep during the day.  Well, this doesn't really work with a solar powered watch.  I get by, but it can be a hassle some times.  All-in-all, this is a great watch, and if you don't work at night then the solar power won't be a problem for you, except maybe in the winter when you wear coats that cover your wrist.  Just take that into consideration when purchasing a solar powered watch
Basic smoker, but an outstanding value for the price.  Arrived before expected, well-packed, easy assembly.  Smokes efficiently, although the temperature gauge never goes to "ideal."  I'm very pleased with this product
The Wine Spectator is the ultimate guide to wine.  As a magazine, it gives trusted up-to-date information on wine and related issues.  I look forward to each issue and always find something interesting.  I would definitely recommend this periodical to all wine lovers
I expected Parmalat brand milk but received a different brand altogether. I also excpected this to have a long shelf life, not just a few months. I thought the product was overpriced for what I received
I'm pretty new to the Yoga experience. I started with a Kathy Smith DVD (hated it!) then I got a Yoga Zone Video -- the one for flexibility and toning and I found it to be very good. I then got another video -- Yoga Shakti which is excellent too and I was looking for another beginner video (the Yoga Shakti one has some advanced parts in it) so I bought Yoga Zone -- Introduction to Yoga. While some of the moves in it are on my first video, I still found this to be very good for beginners. Alan again teaches you the breathing technique -- which I often forget.  I noticed on another review someone complained about the slowness of it. Yes, it does move slow HOWEVER if you're a beginner and you're just learning the poses, the last thing you would want is for it to move fast. He takes the time to explain each pose and how it should feel when you're doing it. His voice is very soothing and puts me in a calm frame of mind. ---  --- I honestly have to say that if I did NOT originally buy a yoga zone dvd, I more than likely would not have pursued the practice.  I think that Yoga Zone is what has gotten me more into it and wanting to practice more and learn more. ---  --- I highly suggest this dvd to any beginner yoga-lite out there
The Sportline 353 Talking Pedometer works ok as a pedometer and as an FM radio, but it has 2 issues. ---  --- The Good: The talking part of this pedometer can be turned off or on. It is nice to hear when you are rolling along, "9000 steps." The FM radio is very elementary, but functional. There is no dial to tune. You push a button and it rolls to the next station. There is a volume control on the earphones. The pedometer uses AAA batteries that can be purchased anywhere.   ---  --- The Bad: The pedometer was constantly slipping off my waistband and bouncing on the floor. It didn't break, but it was very annoying. Several times it popped off w/o me knowing and I left it in a restaurant or in a friend's car.  ---  --- The Ugly: If I accidentally bumped the reset button  - on the kitchen counter or on the arm of a chair - the pedometer lost the day's count and went back to zero. The pedometer does not have a memory feature - so the tally is lost. This would sometimes happen 2-3 times a day. Very frustrating.  ---  --- The clip broke after about 3 months -- so I retired it.  ---  --- I bought a Omron HJ112 Premium Pedometer and have been very pleased with it. It has a teather so if the clip slips off my waistband, the pedometer dangles -- it does not bounce on the floor. It has a 7-day memory feature and automatically resets at midnight. It has a clock. It uses a button battery. It does not have a radio and it doesn't talk, but it works and works well.  ---  --- The Sportline would be good if it had a teather, a clip that didn't break so easily, and a reset button that could not be pushed accidentally.
But I like Sasha and Jade better. She's cute though. She has brown hair with blond highlights and big hazel eyes and her beauty mark looks so cute! ---  --- Her first outfit is a pink tank top with a silver necklace design. Her skirt is a strange black, pink, and gold pattern. Her shoes are pink with small gold hearts and a yellow "stone" in the middle. ---  --- Her second outfit is a black tank top with a silver chandelier design. Her jeans are light blue with flower designs and a silver and hot pink fringe over it. Her shoes are black mary janes with red designs on them. ---  --- Thanks for reading my review! Hope you enjoy her
The clock was off by -4 hours even after so called rebooting. I called tech support and they requested me to send the clock back to them at my cost so that they can pop the hands off and advance it four hours. They should have replaced it for free but they did not. I just think this clock is just a big hoax
I ordered the book from them on Nov1. On Nov 15 I called and they told me they didn't have it. The money was returned by Amazon
The GTA series is the best games ever created, the freedom to do what ever you want, take out gangs with a rocket launcher, toss a nade into heavy populated areas, kill the police and take their cars, put out fires and earn money, beat up civilians and take their money, help mob bosses, pick up hookers with a taxi and drop them off, hack people to death with a chainsaw, own mansions and other properties, fly on a jetpack, kill army soldiers and take their tanks and jets, listen to radio stations and humorous radio talk shows and ads like pogo the monkey. just the best games ever created
Great picture, great price, superb & fast delivery by Amazon (via EGL trucking). --- No complaints except for a faint buzzing sound on the plasma TV. I have heard that all plasma's "buzz" a bit. This would not stop me from purchasing this TV again
Not best for running but look very cool.  comfortable enough to wear for styl
In my opinion:  --- I own a ton of Panasonic equipment, most recently a DVD recorder. I was using Sony DVD-Rs with no problems, but, being a Panasonic person, I figured Panasonic must be better.  ---  --- In order to save a few bucks, I joined the Panasonic Club at the Panasonic website, and ordered a spindle of these same type DVD-Rs. I did this on 9/20/06.  ---  --- I made several phone calls and emails to find out where my discs were, and, believe it or not, nobody at Panasonic could tell me why they hadn't been shipped. Then, I was promised that they did ship, but I never got them. After being talked into placing a duplicate order by a Panasonic Rep, I didn't get that order either.  ---  --- I finally received one order on 10/16/06. They were so poorly packaged that the holder was broken. Now, I finally had my discs. Guess what? They were only 1-8x speed (the Sony discs were 1-16x speed), and my thermal label printer wouldn't print on them because of the finish. I had been assured that I could print on them with a thermal printer.  ---  --- I did burn a couple of movies, and they worked, but I saw nothing special that I can report.  ---  --- It gets worse: I logged into my Panasonic Club account, and saw two charges I hadn't made: one for $10,017 and one for $915. I fell off the back of my chair. To this day nobody has called me, but I managed to get some email responses, and I was told I would have to watch my credit card - that's just what I need!  ---  --- You know, sometimes you buy a brand and think great things about how wonderful a Company it is, and then one day you have some dealings and realize how wrong you were.  ---  --- I'm going back to Sony, and let me tell you, Amazon Customer Service blows away just about every company I've dealt with (sorry about the preposition). I should have bought on Amazon.  ---  ---  --- 
I was looking forward to the arrival of this bike so much, I thought it was going to be a great way to burn calories while doing just about anything. But when I tried it I discovered 2 things. First off your legs have to be at a 90 degree angle in order to pedal without it moving all over the place (which means you have to have an adjustable office chair or put phone books on a normal one). And when I finally get settled on it no matter how hard of a setting it's on it only burns about a calorie a minute.  ---  --- This bike might be great for arm workouts because it doesn't move as much on the table and it can offer a lot of resistance (though I only tried it for a few minutes) but definitely not for your legs
Choosing our first grill really was a simple decision. We knew we wanted something quality and that would last us for a while. Weber was the only way to go in our minds. Now that we own this grill I can honestly say that hardly a day goes by that we don't use it! ---  --- I'm really glad that we opted for the one touch rather than the smokey joe by the same manufacturer. This grill has a hook inside the cover to hang on the side and ash clean up is very easy. And for the two of us, this grill is enough to keep us or even guests well entertained. Highly recommended
The only bottles my daughter would take were the Playtex Original Nursers. I am pumping at work with a Medela Pump in Style, so I was pumping into the Medela bottles and then we were transfering the milk into the Playtex Drop-ins to feed her. It was a hassle and I never felt like all of the milk, especially the fat, made it from the Medela bottles into the Drop-ins. And then I heard about this kit and bought two immediately - I have been so happy with being able to pump directly into the Drop-ins. The only downside: you have to buy at least two kits if you double pump
I would absolutley love this product if it came with an apllicator brush instead of a roller ball. The roller ball hardly lets any of the gloss come out, and you find yourself rolling it over & over again to get a decent amount of gloss. The gloss itself is pretty(once you get enough on your lips.) And it does taste & smell delicious. But it is way too much trouble with the roller ball. I would suggest they make this with an applicator brush. It would make a great product
my five year old loves this . has the cutest songest and easiest lyrics to remember. So easy for a little kid.  Fun, Fun , Fu
Wow! I was really pleased with my purchase. I've never owned a heavy bag before so I didn't know what to expect. I just started martial arts so I wanted a bag to practice on, but I didn't have a lot of money to spend. This purchase was not only well within my price range, but the bag is high quality and includes a speed bag with gloves! The gloves aren't very padded, a boxer friend of mine told me the gloves included were really for use on the speed bag. The heavy bag comes filled and is very solid, the chain is heavy duty, and the connections for the chain on the bag are well attached with double stitching. I was a little uncertain about just what the Nevatear material was, now I know. My description would be a heavy duty nylon with a slight rubberized feeling. In my opinion better than the abrasive canvas bags, yet not as soft to the touch as a leather bag. Two other purchases I would recommend are a good set of padded gloves for use on the heavy bag (I purchased some padded grappling gloves) and for the speed bag you will need two things: (1) a swivel attachement (I bought the Everlast plastic ball swivel for about $15 at a local Academy Sports Store) and (2)you will need to make or purchase a backboard and stand or wall attachment (I made mine from 2 x 6's and 3/4" MDF). All in all, a GREAT purchase! I couldn't be happier
Does not work with non-Apple base stations! I had a PowerMac G5. I was told by Apple retail store clerks it will work any wireless G access points. But No! At my house my PC can see no less than 6 wireless AP's (some from neighbors, one mine). But this Airport card can only see one (which is an Apple Airport Station)! Tried everything ( Googled, set encryption modes,  slow downed my LinkSys WAP tranfering bitrate to 2Mbps etc...) and no luck. Returning it tomorrow
Purchased a total of 20 of these.  --- I previously sold the American International brand Sirius antenna but there was a temporary shortage in the market. --- Four of the twenty Terk brand units were dead on installation. Sadly, I thought Terk was a quality brand. My mistake!
great book, too bad the movie changes almost the entire story by leaps and bounds.  i was only half way through the novel when i bought the movie, almost didn't finish reading it.  they must have paid the author alot to destroy what could have been an epic film.  on a brighter note i agree with the other reviewors that saphira's voice was right on, and while the movie character of Brom was fully wasted, jeremy irons did a fine job.  i look forward to starting the next book, but will skip the next movie. 
The Thule load bars that I actually received were only 50 inches long, and I needed the 58 inch load bars, so I really couldn't do anything with them.  It specifically said right in the title that they were the 58 inch bars, but they were not.  I even wrote amazon  back to try and right the situation, but no one contacted me, so I had to sell the bars on ebay and buy another pair that were the right length
I wanted this set since I saw it in Babies-r-us, but it was so much more expensive. This is perfect for my new baby girl. I always loved Hello Kitty and I hope she will too. Also, there are many cute accessories that you can purchase with this set. The lamp, rug, and mobile are a must! =) The set comes with only one window valance, and as my nursery has 2 windows, I had to purchase an additional valance. Just something to keep in mind when buying this
While Photek was (and still is) reknowned for his minimalist approach to breakbeats and electronic sound, his approach changes significantly on "Solaris." Starting off with the first three tracks, his beats still retain some of the stattacco nature of his earlier work (especially on "Modus Operandi"), but sound more full, more resonant. The tracks where he wanders into the realm of House were quite repeditive, and despite Robert Owen's wonderful efforts (first time I've heard him), they were lacking. The best track on the album, and one of the best Photek works is definitely "Infinity." The rumbling bass really cuts right to the core, and reminds me a little of Source Direct. The trip-hop efforts are good for his first attempt at such music, but the more ethereal "Halogen" left an impression. A wash of sound that previously Parkes would be itching to rip apart with a snare roll, it comes off much better for the lack of any true form. Not a great album, but solid and indicative of where Photek would like to go in terms of his future works
This has got to be one of the easiest blood pressure monitors to use.  It really doesn't start until your arm is in the correct position, letting you know by beeping when you've got it right.  The display is large and easy to read and understand.  I definitely would recommend this
I bought this for my niece's 5th Birthday, and she loved it! My nephew (8) wouldn't leave her alone, he wanted to ride it. My brother-in-law got on it, and it actually moved him around. It is very durable, thick plastic looks like it will last a while. For the price, if it lasts this summer only, it is worth it
Maybe it's just me, but I really don't see the appeal of this movie. It's an incredibly small production (3 actors comprise nearly the entire film), with very low production values. Norman Reedus gives by far the weakest performance as the hitchhiker, but Alan Rickman and Polly Walker are not at their finest, either. (And I am an Alan Rickman fan just like anyone else who would even consider watching this movie.) If you are an Alan Rickman fan, chances are you've already seen your fair share of horrible and incomprehensible movies that leave you wondering why an accomplished actor would choose them. And Dark Harbor is just one more of these. Don't let the promise of a "nude scene" convince you to buy this movie - honestly, Alan Rickman is better appreciated with his clothes on. As far as the movie is concerned, the plot is unoriginal and not particularly engaging. It is a very dialogue-heavy film and the dialogue is not well-written enough to carry it off.
I have seen others wear these slides and I know Adidas usually supplies an excellent product. I did read the other reviews that warned of a need for "breaking in" the sole nubs and wearing socks during that process. However, I've worn these slides for 2+ months and they still make the soles of my feet tender unless I continue to wear socks.  I am disappointed in the slide but I will stubbornly continue to wear them. Maybe some day they will be "broken"
This is the second book in the Wind Dancer series. The Wind Dancer being the first, which was excellent.  I almost feel as if I liked Storm Winds even more than The Wind Dancer, and I believe it's due to a more comprehensive, abundance of history.  I was absolutely and totally absorbed with this book from the first chapter until the last one.  The characters were very individualistic and intriguing.  I have to say I enjoyed the romance more between the two supporting characters:  Catherine and Francois, more than the main characters:  Juliette and Jean Marc.  I was enamored by Francois and his strength, steeliness, and sensuality.  Jean Marc was a dark, handsome man as well.  Because of the way Juliette was treated in her youth, I see why she was so desperate for someone to need her; hence her demanding, take-charge attitude to care for her friend and others.  Catherine was a delight.  She was soft, caring, and sweet, but her terrible experience made her strong and even more beautiful in nature.  Fascinating characters and historical background.  I would recommend this book to all those who love romance that isn't the typical,dull Harlequin type and a love for important historical eras.
Attention! I got this lenmar from Amazon. However, it is not compatible with my latest model of sony's dcr-hc96 camcorder! The camcorder warns you to use infolithium battery, and then shuts down. That's it
Did not get Kodak Max, instead recieved regular Kodak CRV3 battery. I thought I was ordering a better version, seller NEEDS to change misleading picture!
I just cam from Las Vegas and the sandisk has a disk error that doesn't allow for more photos after only using 40mb. I have tried to format the disk using the camera and through Windows XP. It doesn't allow it to be formatted. Bad investment!!! Would not recommend the product unless there is a way I can get a refund or an exchange
These shorts look like normal hiking or outdoor shorts, but underneath they have a snug lycra lining and padding where you need it.  The construction is very sturdy, and the pockets are a great bonus.  I loved the first pair so much that I bought a second pair
I admit, I haven't finished this book.  A friend recommended it to me as I have been having problems with insomnia.  I was interested in reading a book about women's health issues and this one sounded intriguing UNTIL she started in with her tarot cards, interest in astrology and angels.  Granted, I am not a firm believer in just "the hard facts" but its really hard to believe anything this woman writes after it is clear that common sense isn't alternative enough for her!
My daughter has an earlier version that the one shown so it is possible they have addressed some of these issues: ---  --- 1) most games have a 1 minute time out which is really frustrating for my kids ---  --- 2) "Oh that's not so good" - If I hear Barbie say that one more time I may just throw this thing out the nearest window.  My daughter will get a score in a game she feels really good about and barbie says, "Oh that's not so good, but you'll be better with a bit more practice"  This has broken my daughter down into tears more than once. ---  --- 3) There are no parental controls.  I wanted to turn off or lengthen the timer.  I expected those sorts of features from Oregon Scientific.   ---  --- Right now the most fun thing my kids do with it is play the Flower Fun game (like hangman) and type in "ICUP" ---  --- If you are looking at a newer version of this I would strongly recommend playing with a demo for a few minutes to check it out
Bought this player for its size (sports) and its Napster compatibility. Updated the firmware after having a rocky start; but things seem a little more stable now. Also seemed to shut off in cold weather when outside for long periods (around 0 degrees Celsius) - odd behaviour - but mostly OK now that we are in the Spring teens again. Haven't found a case yet to protect from sweat. Interface is what I expected - dead simple. No complaints for the price
My two daughters (two and four) got this for Christmas from "Santa", after seeing this, they no longer had any interest in any other gift.  They love it and spend hours on in fixing each others hair
What can I say that most of the people reviewing this cd haven't already said. --- Arthur is OUTRAGEOUSLY talented. It's almost shocking. --- The depth of songwriting and production values are so intense.  --- It's extremely well recorded and mixed music.  --- Anyone into audio manipulation should just buy all of his albums right now. --- "Stumble and Pain" is probably my favourite track. The sinister tone of it and the synth effects are just superb. --- As with all Arthur albums the vocals are dense, layered, and its something he's obviously worked on for a long time and it really pays off on this album! --- Anyone new to him should buy this immediatly and buy redemption's  son straight after that. --- WHAT A MUSICIAN
Well I ordered this iron and recieved a different one!So how can I rate it.......mad at amazo
We have a big smiling rubber rat in the state store where I work, but he isn't nearly as menacing as this sucker! In fact's he's kinda friendly. This guy's a beast...blood red eyes, sharp claws, looks like he'd take your throat if you slipped and fell in the bathroom. No ordinary broom neccesary here, friends, no, what you need is a can of mase and a nightstick. Buy this guy, set him in the windows of a dark room, and call the cops. God knows they need some useful stuff to do at night besides drink coffee and play video games. Would get more stars, but he's damn expensive
This is a classic Boss pedal, it's been around for awhile.  Boss is known for their great sounding effects and rugged construction of their products, this one is no different.  The distortion from this pedal is simple, very smooth, and very versatile.  It's not too noisy, allowing single notes played to be heard with clarity.  If you'd like to hear it, you can probably find some sound clips of it being used on Boss's website
I think this is a pretty good earpiece...  granted, I've only used one other (it was a flimsy little thing that came w/ my friend's Nokia), but this one far surpasses that one in sound quality and comfort.  Where my friend's would fall out of my ear, this one (once I got it figured out) never comes loose.    Second, listening to people on my friend's, I would have to turn up the sound to hear the person well, and then they sounded muffled and distorted; but on my Jabra I can actually turn down the volume on my phone and they sound crisp and clear-- moreso than when I'm not using the earpiece.  Finally, when my friend calls me and uses her earpiece, she sounds distant and muffled; I've had no complaints from the people I'm talking to using the Jabra, and, in fact, my mom said it sounds better when I use the EarBoom than when I don't. ---  --- The ear gels are a bit hard to get used to.  They are oddly shaped (as you can see in the picture), and there are six of them total-- three of them for each ear.  Lots of reviewers complained about the fit and comfort of the ear gels, while others claim these are the most comfortable earpieces they've used and that they fit perfectly...  I can honesly say I've had both experiences.  When I first got this unit the earpiece kept falling out everytime that I would turn my head: *very* frustrating.  I tried pushing it into my ear as hard as I could, I tried holding it in place with my hand, but that only seemed to defeat the purpose of having a hands-free earpiece.  Nothing seemed to work.  I was thinking of returning it.  I was thinking of throwing it into traffic on I-95.  And then one day, somehow, I came to the realization that you have to sort of twist it into your ear-- with the little poky-out part stuck in the fold of your ear next to the ear canal (not the fold on the top of your ear; if you do that it'll just pop out again)-- and then *voila* it stays put.  Matter o' fact, it'll stay put so well that it'll be a little bit difficult-- even *painful*-- to get out again. --- I can imagine that people with different ear sizes, different patience levels, and lower IQs might have different experiences than my own.  But all I can say is that once I had this little bugger figured out, I was golden.  I love this thing and almost never talk on the phone without it. --- Admittedly, it is a bit difficult to get into your ear-- I'd say it takes upward of 2 seconds to get in properly (before you're good and practiced at it), which may not sound like a lot, but it's long enough to not recognize somebody's voice or hear the first sentence they say, or whatever.  A *very mild* frustration.  But like all things good and pleasant, it takes a little practice to get it just right and now I have it so that I can answer the phone, slip the EarBoom in my ear and start a conversation without missing a beat.  In fact, I find this earpiece to be so comfortable that I forget that it's in until I go to scratch my ear or something! ---  --- The other complaint that I saw on here was that it's not compatible with Nokia phones.  In fact, it even says right on the package that it's not compatible with Nokia.  That's funny, I have a Nokia 3589i and it works just fine.  They make two other models of EarBoom (one of which clearly would not have worked with my phone), both of which claim to be Nokia compatible, and *neither* of those works with my phone!  Confusing?  Yes!  The problem is it doesn't work with *all* Nokia phones.  While browsing at the store I noticed that the ones that claimed to be Nokia compatible had a list of phones that it works with, but it didn't include mine (it included one that was, numerically speaking, very close to my model: the 3590); which piqued my curiosity.  And so I went to the friendly manager of the store that I was in and he opened two of the different packages for me and let me test both of them.  One of them worked, the other didn't.  The strange part of it was that we couldn't see a visible difference in the two units...  and then one of us noticed that on one of them the jack had two small black stripes around it (that's this one, and if you look closely at the picture you can see them), while the other one (the one marked as Nokia compatible) had three.  Hmmm...  Curious. --- So my advice is to either know your phone well (as in, have the little book handy) or ask for help before purchasing. ---  --- All in all 4 of 5 stars.  I'd give it 5 stars on performance and comfort, but have to take it down a notch for an extended period of getting used to it and for confusing packaging. ---  --- Addendum: --- Several months later the little piece of foam has fallen from the end of the boom so that any sound from the wind becomes almost unbearably loud for the person at the other end...  And living in windy Providence, this is a bit of an annoyance. --- Also, for a while I was having a problem where the earpiece would cut out for seconds at a time so that I couldn't hear the person on the other end of the line (and, likewise, they couldn't hear me) unless I jiggled the little jack.  This was *very *FRUSTRATING.**  Now, for some reason, I'm not having that problem anymore.  I'm not really sure if the problem was due to my phone or the EarBoom.  Either way, it's something buyers should be aware of
I thought these were amazing.  My favorite is the Socorro blend.  A review said they were soggy, but I'm not sure what they mean.  They are very crisp with nice and chewy fruit.  Despite the fruit, they aren't sweet but the sweet in the fruit really balances out the hotness of the other seasoning.   --- As for the price, these are expensive nuts and high quality ingredients.  The flavors are unusual, but perfect.  I am defiantly going to order more
I'm the type of guy who has never bothered to buy slippers.  I run around the house in socks.  I'm getting a little older now and my feet seem to get cold, plus I run outside to do quick things like grab something from my shop, turn on the water for a tree or plant, etc... things that normally require me to slip on some shoes.  These slippers are VERY soft, but have a substantial enough sole to step a few steps outside without worry.  The light color and porous surface do tend to stain easily however, but so far I've managed to wash off the toothpaste drips and such (laugh with me).  Yes I'd recommend them for now and will let you know later how they held up
This is a must have watch for serious runners.  I have had mine for over a month and I love mine.  I am a professional track and field athlete, and I train very hard to win races.  This watch helps me train better than any other watch I've ever had.  It gives you up to 50 lap splits which are great for any workout that is over 800 meters on a track.  Not only that but it has 5 interval timers, which you can set your appropriate rest time on. ---    If you are a serious runner like myself, I highly suggest you get this watch.  It is definately something that you will need
The features on this toy are cute, just not planned out very well.  My boys love the music and bubbles, but the micky and goofy that go up and down on the sides broke off after a couple days.  The voice recorder is very hard to work because of a short cord. For a ride on my boyslike the radiio flyer retro rocket more.  Overall, in our house this is a bubble machine. 
I bought mine at the same Toys R' Us Sale and had the exact same issue. Both my husband and I own Trek bikes and it wouldn't work his bike at all. It fit on mine only to find out that my heels would hit the footrest of the carrier. I woulud only recommend buying if you have the patience to install it on your bike only to find out that it won't work comfortably while you're riding. Not to mention that my two year old is very tall and he didn't look comfortable in it anyway. The free helmet is way too small for his head. We've returned it and have yet to purchase a different one yet. I think we're going to a bike shop
I bought one of these lanterns three years ago at the local discount store.  I have used it numerous times on camping expeditions.  It outputs very bright light at full blast.  The lantern is quick to light and the best part is it does not require matches. ---  --- The only three issues I have with this lantern are: --- 1. Sucks the propane.  I also have the coleman fuel lantern, and while it is not as bright, it can go for a week of camping on one tank (5 cups) of fuel.   --- 2. Loud.  This lantern is loud when burning.  The above mentioned lantern is much quieter. --- 3. Construction -- the fiberglass (?) base around the knob has disintegrated from my thumb rubbing it when trying to light the lantern.  Hopefully this will not affect the longevity of the lantern. ---  --- I'd recommend it if you are looking for convenience and bright light, but if you are looking for value, go with the old dual mantle coleman fuel (pump up) lantern. 
I bought one and it worked great. At first it's hard to manuever because it's really hot, and the barrel's bristles are kinda rough and pull your hair a lot, but once you get used to it, it does a stellar job of straightening your hair. Around 6 months into using the straightner, the machine slowly overheated and died. Thinking I had a faulty model, I went out and bought a new one. Guess what ? A few months into THAT one, it ended the same way. ---  --- So basically, not worth it.
Anyone who's a fan of the Black Isle games based on the infinity engine should enjoy this game.  They changed up the character creation a little, so you seemingly have more control over your character's strengths and weaknesses.  While IWDII doesn't have the depth of Torment or the NPC interaction of the Baldur's Gate series, it still has a good story and a nice interface.  Graphically it's subpar to the NWN series, but I think that might actually be a benefit, as I found the 3D aspect of NWN to be a hinderence at times.  Some tips for those interested: ---  --- 1. Make a party of 4 characters.  They will level up faster and have less hang ups with the AI.  With 6 members, I found I needed to start over and import them into a new game after the prologue because they were under powered, and 2 of them always end up wandering off on me.  Those problems are abated with only 4 characters. --- 2.  Multiclassing is key.  Having thief abilities is nice, but you don't really need more than 3 or 4 levels as rogue. Sink all the points into picking locks, and traps.  Multiclass into a ranger or mage.  You won't have to worry about armor hindering thief skills.  Adding a few levels of fighter to cleric or barbarian helps learn more weapon skills, and in the case of a cleric, a boost to HP.  These are just a few ideas... --- 3.  For the warriors, focus on only a couple differnt weapons.  Make sure you have at least one of them blunt weapons, as some foes aren't as vulnerable to the bladed variety.  Also, have at least 2 members competent with ranged weapons
I bought this stroller for when we had our second child.  My children are 19 mo. apart.  I had the Aria single stroller for my first and loved it.  This one is definitely not the same.  For one thing, it is very hard to steer and get over bumps.  The wheels are always getting stuck.  Second, it is hard to close.  The most frustrating part is the steering issue.  Also, my Aria decal fell off as well many months ago.  I've only had the stroller for nine months.  One more thing, the canopy to block out the sun is basically worthless since it offers very little protection from the sun.  
I have used this product inside my bedroom during the last few months but I have not felt there was any improvement in the air.  During the winter months, I generally get sore throat and an occasionally fever.  This year, nothing has changed since using this product.  This product is as good as the electric pest repellers. 
While I can't agree with the other reviewer RE the quality of the 560 jeans (it seems excellent to me, having owned six pairs over the last two years, which I wear to work every day), and certainly as men's jeans, I don't think they're "out of style", I do have to say Amazon's price on this item is far, far out-of-line.  You can find these same jeans online elsewhere for $38 (with free or cheap shipping), meaning the cost is nearly $20 less than what Amazon is charging
This book of eight stories by Virginia Woolf shows Virginia's mind at work demonstrating her "stream of consciousness." Each story flows from one thought to another asking different questions about life.  For  example, "The Mark on the Wall" questions the meaning of life and  existence.  "An Unwritten Novel" is about what people hide and  what you don't know about a person you seat next to on an  "omnibus."  All these stories will make you look at life in a  slightly different way
I bought the Zune around Christmas time of 2006. I used it on a daily basis and was happy with it. Early in April, it stopped working. After spending three (3) hours on the phone with four (4) technicians, Microsoft accepted my return for repair and sent me a box to ship it to their repair facility. Two (2) weeks later, I received the Zune back with a note that the Zune was not repaired because the problem it had was not within the warranty limitations. They did not tell me what the problem was - only that they did not fix it. I was more then dismayed. I had spent almost $300.00 with tax and shipping to buy this product. I did not abuse it in any way. Please think twice before buying this product. If and when it breaks - Microsoft will not fix it and you will be stuck with a $300.00 paperweight.
I love this chair.  We have traveled to several family members homes with the booster and it has worked so well. I have also referred people to the web site to buy one for themselves. 
Some photographers think what's erotic is what's hidden and left to the imagination. Two Thirds of the pictures in this book are fig leafed with shadows or clothing, leaving plenty to the imagination. Think of playboy magazine in the 1950's or Vogue or Madamoselle magazine today.  Many of these are stylistic, but not very erotic.  One in three of the photos in the book are erotic, not afraid of nudity. Don't make the investment in this book if you want high level eroticism. Instead get "Shaven Angels", "Natural Beauties", "100 Naked Girls", or "Crazy,Sexy Girls". 
I registered for this item as one of those "I wouldn't buy it but it's a nice thing to have". I did receive it and am so glad I did. My son loves this!! He gets so comfy and warm and will sleep for hours in this boppy lounger. I would defninitely recommend this and would buy more if I needed them
When I purchased this, I was under the false impression that the idea of a silicon skin was to provide the unit with some shock protection in the event that it were to get dropped.  ---  --- The skin is so thin, that it does nothing but keep a little bit of dust off of the buttons. ---  --- The belt clip is made of brittle plastic and broke the second day that I used it. ---  --- Don't waste your money, spend the extra bucks to get something that will last a while. --- 
 --- "The Wall Street Journal" is one of the most-in-depth business journals available. It is an interesting blend of current events and insightful analysis of prevailing and sometimes not so apparent trends. The quality of reporting is generally balanced and professional. ---  --- Although every newspaper has a political orientation of one sort or the other, the Wall Street Journal news reporting is largely free of politics, making it a good source of unbiased news and information for most people. However, its editorial section is conservative, although thankfully the editorial section is a tiny portion of the whole magazine. ---  --- The journal has a lot of insightful business news that every manager at any level should find useful. The reporters cover the various topics in great detail and with knowledgeable perspective from all sides. They are not afraid to cover corporate transgression with rigour and honesty. ---  --- The journal also covers various other topics such as personal finance, special reports, business profiles, interviews, commentary, market and news of note for management personnel.
Had good taste, but you sure couldn't make a sandwitch out of it. Just big --- hunks of meat. Its nothing like the pictures
Good purchase.  Although I have not used the headset yet, the case and charger work perfectly.  Great savings.  Amazon is the place to shop for a discount
it was much smaller than i thought.  It had a long arm that attached to cut larger papers.  But it sagged so you only kept half of the paper up.  Then when cutting it worked great until the very end.  The very end it would not cut.  Very disapointe
You can only ride for 45 minutes after charging the battery for 12 hours. Forget about buying an extra battery to charge while you ride, because of the adapter it only charges while its on  the machine. There is no seperate battery charger.
My two year old absolutely would not leave the store without this and she still plays with it a year later. However, there are two problems. One, it immediately needed repair to the basic connections and, two, it has a pinching hazard between the basket and the frame. But of course, my daughter never noticed either of those. She simply loves to play with it, constantly, and has to take it on walks around the block
The checkbook package was opened.  No pieces were missing.  But It was hard to glue the plastic to the cardboard to give it as a Christmas gift
Most posters here haven't actually bought/used a Toilet Monster.  It's a really great joke/prank.  We bought one and used it for my mother-in-law.  She was stunned and a bit disoriented...then...wait for it...she laughed really really hard.  It's not scary, just startling.  The way we installed it, if someone opens the lid and seat, they won't see it, so it's best to try on women.  Great for the price
I like the look of the shoes and the shiny parts are easy to clean, although the cloth parts are difficult to keep clean. I have a high arch and they seem to support well so I would say over all they were a good choice
I use these for MMA type workout on bags& blocking pads, and they have worked well. They give good protection even when hitting hard. I have not had the problem with dye fading that I noticed with some other gloves. Overall I would reccomend, about the same or less than other gloves from everlast, century, ect and just as good quality.FYI There are a lot of visible seams where the pads "pockets" are attached (especially on the fingers) that you can't see well in the picture advertised. I do't think this is a big deal as many bag gloves have this, I wouldn't use them to spar as these would tend to cut. (most people would use "fighting gloves" to spar anyway, but just trying to be helpful !!
I had two choices watching this movie...smile or laugh out loud. When I wasn't smiling I was laughing. Keaton's The General is a perfect introduction for those who may shy away from silent movies or who may think silent comics are too exaggerated and mannered. The story line is simple, but what Keaton does with it is genius.  ---  --- Johnny Gray (Buster Keaton) is an engineer for the Western and Atlantic Railroad. He has two loves, his engine, the General, and Annabelle Lee (Marion Mack), a fine Southern belle. When war starts, Johnny rushes to enlist but is rejected. He's more valuable to the South as a train engineer than he would be as a soldier. Trouble is, nobody tells him why he was rejected. Worse, Annabelle thinks he may be a coward, and tells him she doesn't want to see him again until he is in uniform. Just then northern spies secretly enter the town to steal the General and take it north, destroying bridges and lines along the way, while a Northern army moves south. Unknowingly, Annabelle Lee finds herself on the train and is kidnapped. Johnny sees the General chugging away and races after it, determined to bring back the General. When he realizes Annabelle Lee is held captive, his resolve knows to bounds. ---  --- For the rest of the movie we are on one of the cleverest, fastest, funniest chase movies ever filmed. Keaton creates slapstick situations and sight gags that not only are funny, but that always are in character and which always are part of the specific plot point. And when he rescues Annabelle and realizes how hopeless her Southern belle helplessness can be, his exasperation is matched only by his love. The General features a big cast, a major battle, fleeing armies, a failing dam and a spectacular moment when an engine tries to cross a burning bridge and everything collapses into a river gorge. ---  --- Keaton's timing and inventiveness are legendary; so is his risk-taking. He does all his own stunts and some of them were dangerous. In one, he is lying back on the engine's cow catcher while the train is moving at some speed forward. In the distance is a railroad tie across the tracks. Keaton has another railroad tie in his hands. At the last moment he tosses his tie so that the end hits the end of the other tie and they both bounce off the track just as Keaton on the cow catcher passes. This scene has no cutting. The two ties fly off as high as Keaton's head. He could have been killed; instead we laugh. It's amazing that in his older years Keaton could still walk. His body took incredible punishment for the laughs. Try falling hard backwards off a moving flatcar and landing on your back across railroad ties. His ingenuity is extraordinary. How do you build excitement out of an extended train chase? Both engines are behemoths and are on the same track. They can't pass each other. Keaton does it with endless bits of business. In fact, he does manage to reverse the chase at one point in an immensely clever moment combining logic and split-second timing. ---  --- What makes Keaton so funny and so contemporary is that he doesn't do double-takes. He barely reacts. But he's no stone-face. Keaton's characters are simply very serious fellows. Things happen to them. His characters don't react to events so much as they overcome them with honesty and good intentions. ---  --- This edition of The General comes from Kino Video and looks good. It includes two Keaton short films, The Playhouse (1921) and Cops (1922). In The Playhouse, Keaton portrays all the members of the cast, orchestra and audience in a stage show, including nine members of a minstrel act, the ladies in the audience and a trained chimp. In Cops, he finds himself in a police chase that is one amazing situation after another
I put this paper on the wall in my office next to a picture printer on Epson Heavyweight matte paper and the glossy roll picture was yellow in a little over a month.  I will never buy this paper again
This is o.k. if you're using it as a restraint only.  If you want it to protect your child from the germs on the cart, forget it.  I thought the bar cover would keep my baby from touching and chewing on the bars, wrong.  It hardly covers anything.  I went back and bought the cart cover that covers everything, I wish I would have spent the extra money before wasting it on this seat
I had to return this product for my son because I couldn't get  his name which is unique. If they make a product they should have something on it to make unique names by typing it in if it's not on the list. I mean there are more and more unique name sout there and there sure will be more. If i was a rich person I am sure I could have had one made just for him. Get witht the real world people and make things so unique people can have things too.
Nothing but trouble in the long run. Anemometer replaced twice under warranty. Now broken again just as the storms build up. Sending unit no longer sends temp/humidity, even with new batts. --- 
By far and beyond the best history periodical I have come across. And consistantly one of the best magazines I have read. I have subscribed for three years now-and that says a lot for me, especially given the price, since most magazines don't keep my interest for longer than a year. I find myself dropping anything I am currently reading, magazines and books alike, until I have finished each one. ---  --- Easy to read and yet usually contains much detail that you can sink your teeth into. The articles do a fantastic job of appealing to both the uninformed and the seasoned student of history. Ever have one of those teachers that would tell a story and then, at the end, after being rivited by the narrative, you actually found you had learned something in a way that made you feel almost as if you had experienced it yourself? Well, many times I find that this magazine does just that. Every now and then they do get a little fluffy but all in all, unbeatable
While the kids love it, it's a headache for parents. It takes forever to inflate, even with an air compressor, thanks to many individual air chambers. As other reviewers noted, it's best not to leave it outside (the manufacturer recommends against it due to potential sun damage), but it's far too big to leave up inside the house. Not worth the time involved to set it up and take it down. I gave ours away
