# Advanced_NLP_course_HW2
This assignment is about using the infrastructure you built in HW1, now applying a non-linear classifier (specifically, a one-layer feed-forward network) to the problem. The key is that we want you to implement the model by hand, without using neural network or machine learning frameworks. Here is a nice post on why such exercise of implementing your own forward and backward passes is useful. After you do this, you should compare your implementation to a PyTorch implementation (that you should also write) and to the results you got in HW1.
